¶Whan that the Knight had thus his tale ytold,
In al the route° nas° ther yong ne old
That he ne seide it was a noble storie,
And worthy for to drawen to memorie;°
And namely° the gentils° everichon.°
Our Hoste lough° and swoor, “So moot I gon,
This gooth aright; unbokeled is the male;°
Lat see now who shal telle another tale:
For trewely, the game is wel bigonne.
Now telleth ye, sir Monk, if that ye conne,°
Somwhat, to quite° with the Knightes tale.”

¶The Miller, that fordronken° was al pale,
So that unnethe° upon his hors he sat,
He nolde avalen° neither hood ne hat,
Ne abide° no man for his curteisie,
But in Pilates vois he gan to crie,
And swoor by armes and by blood and bones,
“I can° a noble tale for the nones,°
With which I wol now quit° the Knightes tale.”
Our Hoste saugh that he was dronke of ale,
And seide: “Abid, Robin, my leve° brother,
Som bettre man° shal telle us first another:
Abide, and lat us werken thriftily.”°

¶“By goddes soul,” quod he, “that wol nat I;
For I wol speke, or elles go my wey.”
Our Host answerde: “Tel on, a devel wey!°
Thou art a fool, thy wit is overcome.”

¶“Now herkneth,” quod the Millere, “alle and some!
But first I make a protestacioun
That I am dronke, I knowe it by my soun;°
And therfore, if that I misspeke or seye,
Wite it° the ale of Southwerk, I yow preye;
For I wol telle a legende° and a lif
Bothe of a carpenter, and of his wif,
How that a clerk hath set the wrightes cappe.”°

¶The Reve answerde and seide, “Stint thy clappe,°
Lat be thy lewed° dronken harlotrie.°
It is a sinne and eek a greet folie
To apeiren° any man, or him diffame,°
And eek to bringen wives in swich fame.
Thou mayst ynogh° of othere thinges seyn.”

¶This dronken Miller spak ful sone agein,°
And seide, “Leve° brother Osewold,
Who° hath no wif, he is no cokewold.
But I sey nat therfor that thou art oon;
Ther been ful gode wives many oon,
And evere a thousand goode ayeins oon badde,
That knowestow wel thyself, but if thou madde.°
Why artow° angry with my tale now?
I have a wif, pardee,° as well as thou,
Yet nolde I,° for the oxen in my plogh,
Take upon me more than ynogh,°
As demen° of myself that I were oon;°
I wol beleve wel that I am noon.
An housbond shal nat been inquisitive
Of Goddes privetee,° nor of his wif.
So he may finde° Goddes foison° there,
Of the remenant° nedeth nat enquere.”

¶What sholde I more seyn, but this Millere
He nolde his wordes for no man forbere,°
But tolde his cherles° tale in his manere;
M’athinketh° that I shal reherce° it here.
And therfore every gentil wight° I preye,
Demeth noght,° for Goddes love, that° I seye
Of evel entente, but that I moot° reherce
Hir tales alle, be they bet° or werse,
Or elles falsen° som of my matere.
And therfor, whoso list it nat yhere,°
Turne over the leef,° and chese° another tale;
For he shal finde ynowe,° grete and smale,
Of storial thing° that toucheth gentillesse,°
And eek moralitee and holinesse;
Blameth nat me if that ye chese amis.
The Millere is a cherl, ye know wel this;
So was the Reve, and other many mo,
And harlotrie° they tolden bothe two.
Aviseth yow° and put me out of blame;
And eek men shal nat make ernest of game.°

¶Whilom° ther was dwellinge at Oxenford
A riche gnof,° that gestes heeld to bord,°
And of his craft° he was a carpenter.
With him ther was dwellinge a pour scoler,°
Had lerned art,° but al his fantasie°
Was turned for to lerne astrologie,
And coude a certein° of conclusiouns°
To demen° by interrogaciouns,
If that men axed him in certein houres,°
Whan that men sholde have droghte° or elles shoures,
Or if men axed him what shold bifalle
Of every thing, I may nat rekene hem alle.

¶This clerk was cleped° hende° Nicholas;
Of derne° love he coude and of° solas;°
And therto he was sleigh° and ful privee,°
And lik a maiden meke for to see.
A chambre hadde he in that hostelrie°
Allone, withouten any compaignie,
Ful fetisly ydight° with herbes swote;°
And he himself as swete as is the rote°
Of licoris,° or any cetewale.°
His Almageste° and bookes grete and smale,
His astrelabie,° longinge for° his art,
His augrimstones° layen faire apart
On shelves couched° at his beddes heed:
His presse° ycovered with a falding° reed.
And al above° ther lay a gay sautrie,°
On which he made a nightes° melodie
So swetely, that al the chambre rong;
And Angelus ad virginem° he song;
And after that he song the kinges note;°
Ful often blessed° was his mury throte.
And thus this swete° clerk his time spente
After° his freendes finding° and his rente.°

¶This carpenter had wedded newe a wif
Which that he loved more than his lif;
Of eightetene yeer she was of age.
Jalous he was, and heeld hir narwe in cage,°
For she was wilde and yong, and he was old
And demed° himself ben lik° a cokewold.°
He knew nat Catoun, for his wit was rude,°
That bad° man shold wedde his similitude.°
Men sholde wedden after° hir estaat,°
For youthe and elde° is often at debaat.
But sith° that he was fallen in the snare,
He moste endure, as other folk, his care.°

¶Fair was this yonge wif, and therwithal
As any wesele° hir body gent° and smal.°
A ceint° she wered barred° al of silk,
A barmclooth° eek as whit as morne milk
Upon hir lendes,° ful of many a gore.°
Whit was hir smok,° and broiden° al bifore
And eek bihinde, on hir coler° aboute,
Of col-blak silk, withinne and eek withoute.°
The tapes° of hir white voluper°
Were of the same suite° of hir coler;
Hir filet brood° of silk, and set ful hye:
And sikerly° she hadde a likerous° eye.
Ful smale ypulled° were hir browes two,
And tho° were bent, and blake as any sloo.°
She was ful more blisful on to see
Than is the newe perejonet° tree;
And softer than the wolle is of a wether.°
And by hir girdel° heeng a purs of lether
Tasseld with silk, and perled° with latoun.°
In al this world, to seken up and doun,
Ther nis no man so wis, that coude thenche°
So gay a popelote,° or swich a wenche.
Ful brighter was the shining of hir hewe°
Than in the Tour° the noble yforged newe.°
But of hir song, it was as loude and yerne°
As any swalwe sittinge on a berne.°
Therto° she coude skippe and make game,
As any kide° or calf folwinge his dame.°
Hir mouth was swete as bragot° or the meeth,°
Or hord of apples leid in hey° or heeth.°
Winsinge° she was, as is a joly colt,
Long° as a mast, and upright as a bolt.°
A brooch she baar upon hir lowe coler,
As brood as is the bos of a bokler.°
Hir shoes were laced on hir legges hie;
She was a primerole,° a piggesnie°
For any lord to leggen° in his bedde,
Or yet for any good yeman° to wedde.

¶Now sire, and eft sir, so bifel the cas,°
That on a day this hende Nicholas
Fil with this yonge wif to rage° and pleye,
Whil that hir housbond was at Oseneye,
As clerkes ben ful subtile and ful queinte;°
And prively he caughte hir by the queinte,°
And seide, “Ywis, but if° ich have my wille,
For derne° love of thee, lemman,° I spille.”°
And heeld hir harde by the haunchebones,°
And seide, “Lemman,° love me al atones,
Or I wol dyen, also God me save!”
And she sprong as a colt doth in the trave,°
And with hir heed she wryed° faste awey,
And seide, “I wol nat kiss thee, by my fey,
Why, lat be,”° quod she, “lat be, Nicholas,
Or I wol crie out ‘harrow’ and ‘allas.’
Do wey your handes for your curteisie!”

¶This Nicholas gan mercy for to crie,
And spak so faire, and profred° hir so faste,°
That she hir love him graunted atte laste,
And swoor hir ooth, by Seint Thomas of Kent,
That she wol been at his comandement,
Whan that she may hir leiser° wel espie.
“Min housbond is so ful of jalousie,
That but° ye waite wel° and been privee,°
I woot° right wel I nam but deed,” quod she.
“Ye moste been ful derne,° as in this cas.”

¶“Nay therof care thee noght,” quod Nicholas,
“A clerk had litherly° biset his while,°
But if° he coude a carpenter bigile.”°
And thus they been acorded and ysworn
To waite° a time, as I have told biforn.

¶Whan Nicholas had doon thus everydeel,°
And thakked° hir about the lendes° weel,
He kist hir swete, and taketh his sautrie,
And pleyeth faste,° and maketh melodie.

¶Than fil it thus, that to the parish-chirche,
Cristes owne werkes for to wirche,
This goode wif wente on an haliday;°
Hir forheed shoon as bright as any day,
So was it wasshen whan she leet° hir werk.
Now was ther of that chirche a parish-clerk,
The which that was ycleped° Absolon.
Crul° was his heer, and as the gold it shoon,
And strouted° as a fanne large and brode;
Ful streight and even lay his joly shode.°
His rode° was reed, hise eyen greye as goos;
With Poules window corven on his shoos,
In hoses rede° he wente fetisly.°
Yclad he was ful smal° and proprely,°
Al in a kirtel° of a light waget;°
Ful faire and thikke been the pointes° set.
And therupon he hadde a gay° surplis°
As whit as is the blosme upon the ris.°
A mury child° he was, so God me save,
Wel coude he laten blood° and clippe and shave,
And make a chartre of lond or acquitaunce.°
In twenty maner coude he trippe° and daunce
After the scole of Oxenforde tho,°
And with his legges casten to and fro,
And pleyen songes on a small rubible;°
Therto he song somtime a loud quinible;°
And as wel coude he pleye on his giterne.°
In al the toun nas brewhous ne taverne
That he ne visited with his solas,
Ther any gaylard tappestere° was.
But sooth to seyn, he was somdel squaimous°
Of farting, and of speche daungerous°

¶This Absolon, that jolif was and gay,
Gooth with a sencer° on the haliday,
Sensinge the wives of the parish faste;
And many a lovely° look on hem he caste,
And namely° on this carpenteres wif.
To looke on hir him thoughte a mery lif,
She was so propre° and swete and likerous.°
I dar wel seyn, if she had been a mous,
And he a cat, he wolde hir hente° anon.
This parish-clerk, this joly Absolon,
Hath in his herte swich a luf-longinge,°
That of no wif ne took he noon offringe;
For curteisie, he seide, he wolde noon.

¶The mone, whan it was night, ful brighte shoon,
And Absolon his giterne hath ytake,
For paramours,° he thoghte for to wake.
And forth he gooth, jolif° and amorous,
Til he cam to the carpenteres hous
A litel after cokkes hadde ycrowe;
And dressed him up by a shot-windowe°
That was upon the carpenteres wal.
He singeth in his vois gentil and smal,°
“Now, dere lady, if thy wille be,
I prey yow that ye wole rewe° on me,”
Ful wel acordaunt to his giterninge.
This carpenter awook, and herde him singe,
And spak unto his wif, and seide anon,
“What! Alison! herestow nat Absolon
That chaunteth° thus under our boures° wal?”
And she answerde hir housbond therwithal,
“Yis, God wot,° John, I here it everydel.”°

¶This passeth forth; what wol ye bet than wel?°
Fro day to day this joly Absolon
So woweth° hir, that him is wo bigon.°
He waketh al the night and al the day;
He kembed° hise lokkes brode, and made him gay;
He woweth hir by menes° and brocage,°
And swoor he wolde been hir owne page;°
He singeth, brokkinge° as a nightingale;
He sente hir piment,° meeth,° and spiced ale,
And wafres,° piping hote out of the glede;°
And for° she was of toune,° he profred mede,°
For som folk° wol ben wonnen for richesse,
And som for strokes, and som for gentillesse.

¶Somtime, to shewe his lightnesse° and maistrie,°
He pleyeth Herodes on a scaffold hie.
But what availleth° him as in this cas?
She loveth so this hende Nicholas,
That Absolon may blow the bukkes horn;°
He nadde° for his labour but° a scorn;
And thus she maketh Absolon hir ape,°
And al his ernest° turneth til a jape.°
Ful sooth is this proverbe, it is no lie,
Men seyn right thus, “Alwey the nye slie°
Maketh the ferre leve° to be looth.”°
For though that Absolon be wood or wrooth,°
Bicause that he fer was from hir sighte,
This nye Nicholas stood in his lighte.

¶Now ber thee wel, thou hende Nicholas!
For Absolon may waille and singe “Allas.”
And so bifel it on a Saterday,
This carpenter was goon til Osenay;
And hende Nicholas and Alisoun
Acorded been to this conclusioun,
That Nicholas shal shapen him a wile°
This sely° jalous housbond to bigile;
And if so be the game wente aright,
She sholde slepen in his arm al night,
For this was hir desir and his also.
And right anon, withouten wordes mo,
This Nicholas no lenger wolde tarie,°
But doth ful softe° unto his chambre carie
Both mete° and drinke for a day or tweye,°
And to hir housbonde bad° hir for to sey,
If that he axed after Nicholas,
She sholde seye she niste° where he was,
Of al that day she saugh him nat with yë;°
She trowed° that he was in maladie,
For, for no cry,° hir maide coude him calle;
He nolde answere, for thing° that mighte falle.

¶This passeth forth al thilke Saterday,
That Nicholas stille° in his chambre lay,
And eet and sleep, or dide what him leste,°
Til Sonday, that the sonne gooth to reste.
This sely carpenter hath greet merveile
Of Nicholas, or what thing mighte him eile,°
And seide, “I am adrad,° by Seint Thomas,
It stondeth nat aright with Nicholas.
God shilde° that he deide sodeinly!
This world is now ful tikel,° sikerly;°
I saugh today a cors° yborn to chirche
That now, on Monday last, I saugh him wirche.°

¶“Go up,” quod he unto his knave° anoon,
“Clepe° at his dore, or knokke with a stoon,
Looke how it is, and tel me boldely.”°

¶This knave gooth him up ful sturdily,
And at the chambre-dore, whil that he stood,
He cride and knokked as that he were wood:—°
“What! how! what do ye, maister Nicholay?
How may ye slepen al the longe day?”

¶But al for noght, he herde nat a word;
An hole he fond, ful lowe upon a bord,
Ther as° the cat was wont in for to crepe;
And at that hole he looked in ful depe,
And atte laste he hadde of him a sighte.
This Nicholas sat caping° ever uprighte,°
As° he had kiked° on the newe mone.
Adown he gooth, and tolde his maister sone°
In what array he saugh this ilke° man.

¶This carpenter to blessen him° bigan,
And seide, “Help us, Seinte Frideswide!
A man woot° litel what him shal bitide.°
This man is falle, with his astromie,°
In som woodnesse° or in som agonie;
I thoghte ay wel how that it sholde be!
Men shold nat knowe of Goddes privetee.°
Ye, blessed be alwey a lewed° man,
That noght but oonly° his bileve° can!
So ferde another clerk with astromie;
He walked in the feeldes for to prie°
Upon the sterres, what ther shold bifalle,
Til he was in a marle-pit° yfalle;
He saw nat that. But yet, by Seint Thomas,
Me reweth sore° of hende Nicholas.
He shal be rated of° his studying,
If that I may, by Jesus, heven king!
Get me a staf, that I may underspore,°
Whil that thou, Robin, hevest up the dore.
He shal° out of his studying, as I gesse”—
And to the chambre-dore he gan him dresse.°
His knave was a strong carl° for the nones,
And by the haspe° he haf° it up atones;
Into the floor the dore fil anon.
This Nicholas sat ay as stille as stoon,
And ever caped up into the eir.
This carpenter wende° he were in despeir,°
And hente° him by the sholdres mightily,
And shook him harde, and cride spitously,°
“What! Nicholay! what, how! what! looke adoun!
Awake, and thenk on Cristes passioun;
I crouche° thee from elves and fro wightes!”°
Therwith the nightspel° seide he anonrightes
On foure halves° of the hous aboute,
And on the threshfold of the dore withoute:°—
“Jesu Crist, and Seint Benedight,°
Bless° this hous from every wikked wight,
For nightes verie,° the white paternoster!°
Where wentestow° thou Seint Petres soster?”°

¶And atte last this hende Nicholas
Gan for to sike sore,° and seide, “Allas!
Shal al the world be lost eftsones° now?”

¶This carpenter answerde, “What seystow?°
What! think on God, as we don, men that swinke.”°

¶This Nicholas answerde, “Fecch me drinke;
And after wol I speke in privetee
Of certein thing that toucheth° me and thee;
I wol telle it non other man, certein.”

¶This carpenter goth doun, and comth agein,
And broghte of mighty ale a large quart;
And whan that ech of hem had dronke his part,
This Nicholas his dore faste shette,
And doun the carpenter by him he sette.

¶He seide, “John, min hoste lief° and dere,
Thou shall upon thy trouthe° swere me here,
That to no wight thou shalt this conseil wreye;°
For it is Cristes conseil° that I seye,
And if thou telle it man, thou are forlore;°
For this vengaunce thou shalt han therfore,
That if thou wreye me, thou shalt be wood!”°
“Nay, Crist forbede it, for his holy blood!”
Quod tho this sely° man, “I nam no labbe,°
Ne, though I seye, I nam nat lief° to gabbe.
Sey what thou wolt, I shal it never telle
To child ne wif, by him that harwed° helle!”

¶“Now John,” quod Nicholas, “I wol nat lie;
I have yfounde in min astrologie,
As I have loked in the moone bright,
That now, a Monday next, at quarter-night,°
Shal falle a rein° and that so wilde and wood,°
That half so greet was never Nowels° flood.
This world,” he seide, “in lasse than an hour
Shal al be dreint,° so hidous° is the shour;
Thus shal mankinde drenche° and lese° hir lif.”

¶This carpenter answerde, “Allas, my wif!
And shal she drenche? allas! min Alisoun!”
For sorwe of this he fil almost adoun,
And seide, “Is ther no remedie in this cas?”

¶“Why, yis, for Gode,” quod hende Nicholas,
“If thou wolt werken after lore and reed;°
Thou mayst nat werke after thin owne heed.°
For thus seith Salomon, that was ful trewe,
‘Werk al by conseil,° and thou shalt nat rewe.’°
And if thou werken wolt by good conseil,
I undertak, withouten mast and seil,°
Yet shal I saven hir and thee and me.
Hastow nat herd how saved was Noë,
Whan that our lord had warned him biforn
That al the world with water shold be lorn?”°

¶“Yis,” quod this carpenter, “ful yore ago.”°

¶“Hastow nat herd,” quod Nicholas, “also
The sorwe° of Noë with his felawship,
Er that he mighte gete his wif to ship?
Him had be lever,° I dar wel undertake,°
At thilke° time, than alle hise wetheres° blake,
That she hadde had a ship hirself allone.
And therfore, wostou° what is best to done?
This asketh haste, and of an hastif thing
Men may nat preche or maken tarying.

¶Anon go gete us faste into this in°
A knedingtrogh,° or els a kimelin,°
For ech of us, but look° that they be large,
In which we mowe swimme° as in a barge,
And han therinne vitaille° suffisant
But for a day; fy on° the remenant!
The water shal aslake° and goon away
Aboute prime° upon the nexte day.
But Robin may nat wite of this, thy knave,°
Ne eek thy maide Gille I may nat save;
Ax nat why, for though thou aske me,
I wol nat tellen Goddes privetee.°
Suffiseth thee, but if° thy wittes madde,
To han as greet a grace as Noë hadde.
Thy wif shal I wel saven, out of doute,
Go now thy wey, and speed thee° heeraboute.

¶But whan thou hast, for hire and thee and me,
Ygeten us thise kneding-tubbes three,
Than shaltow hange hem in the roof ful hie,
That no man of our purveaunce° spie.
And whan thou thus hast doon as I have seid,
And hast our vitail faire in hem yleid,°
And eek° an ax, to smite the corde atwo°
When that the water comth, that we° may go,
And broke° an hole an heigh, upon the gable,°
Unto the gardinward, over the stable,
That we may frely passen forth our way
Whan that the grete shour is goon away—
Than shaltow swimme° as mirie, I undertake,
As doth the white doke after hir drake.°
Than wol I clep,° ‘how! Alison! how! John!
Be mirie, for the flood wol passe anon.’
And thou wolt seyn, ‘hail, maister Nicholay!
Good morwe, I se thee wel, for it is day.’
And than shul we be lordes al our lif
Of al the world, as Noë and his wif.

¶But of o thing I warne thee ful right,
Be wel avised,° on that ilke° night
That we ben entred into shippes bord,
That noon of us ne speke nat a word,
Ne clep, ne crie, but been in his preyere;
For it is Goddes owne heste° dere.

¶Thy wif and thou mot° hange fer atwinne,°
For that° bitwixe° yow shal be no sinne
Na more in looking than ther shal in dede;
This ordinance is seid, go, God thee spede!°
Tomorwe at night, whan men ben alle aslepe,
Into our kneding-tubbes wol we crepe,
And sitten ther, abiding° Goddes grace.
Go now thy wey, I have no lenger space
To make of this no lenger sermoning.°
Men seyn thus, ‘send the wise, and sey nothing’;
Thou art so wis, it nedeth thee nat teche;
Go, save our lif, and that I thee biseche.”

¶This sely carpenter goth forth his wey.
Ful ofte he seith “Allas” and “Weilawey,”
And to his wif he tolde his privetee;
And she was war, and knew it bet than he,
What al this queinte cast° was for to seye.°
But nathelees she ferde as° she wold deye,°
And seide, “Allas! go forth thy wey anon,
Help us to scape,° or we ben lost echon;°
I am thy trewe verray wedded wif;
Go, dere spouse, and help to save our lif.”

¶Lo! which a greet thing is affeccioun!
Men may die of imaginacioun,
So depe may impressioun be take.
This sely carpenter biginneth quake;°
Him thinketh° verraily that he may see
Noës flood com walwing° as the see
To drenchen° Alisoun, his hony dere.°
He wepeth, waileth, maketh sory chere,°
He siketh° with ful many a sory swogh.°
He gooth and geteth him a kneding-trogh,
And after that a tubbe and kimelin,
And prively he sente hem to his in,
And heng hem in the roof in privetee.
His owne hand° he made laddres three,
To climben by the ronges and the stalkes°
Unto the tubbes hanginge in the balkes,°
And hem vitailled, bothe trogh and tubbe,
With breed and chese, and good ale in a jubbe,°
Suffisinge right ynogh° as for a day.
But er° that he had maad al this array,°
He sente his knave, and eek his wenche also,
Upon his need° to London for to go.
And on the Monday, whan it drow° to night,
He shette his dore withoute candellight,
And dressed° al thing as it sholde be.
And shortly, up they clomben alle three;
They sitten stille wel a furlongway.°

¶“Now, Paternoster,° clom!”° seid Nicholay,
And “Clom,” quod John, and “Clom,” seide Alisoun.
This carpenter seide his devocioun,
And stille he sit, and biddeth° his preyere,
Awaitinge on the rein, if he it here.

¶The dede sleep, for wery bisinesse,°
Fil on this carpenter right, as I gesse,
Aboute corfewtime,° or litel more;
For travail of his goost° he groneth sore,
And eft he routeth,° for his heed mislay.°
Doun of the laddre stalketh° Nicholay,
And Alisoun, ful softe adoun she spedde;°
Withouten wordes mo, they goon to bedde
Theras° the carpenter is wont° to lie.
Ther was the revel and the melodie;
And thus lith Alison and Nicholas,
In businesse of mirthe and of solas,
Til that the belle of laudes° gan to ringe,
And freres° in the chauncel gonne singe.

¶This parish clerk, this amorous Absolon,
That is for love alwey so wo bigon,°
Upon the Monday was at Oseneye
With compaignie, him to disporte° and pleye,
And axed° upon cas a cloisterer°
Ful prively after° John the carpenter;
And he drough him apart out of the chirche,
And seide, “I noot,° I saugh him heer nat wirche
Sin° Saterday; I trow° that he be went
For timber, ther° our abbot hath him sent;
For he is wont° for timber for to go,
And dwellen at the grange a day or two;
Or elles he is at his hous, certein;
Wher that he be, I can nat sothly° seyn.”

¶This Absolon ful joly was and light,
And thoghte, “Now is time wake° al night;
For sikirly° I saugh him nat stiringe
Aboute his door sin day bigan to springe.°

¶So moot° I thrive, I shal, at cokkes crowe,
Ful prively knokken at his windowe
That stant° ful lowe upon his boures° wal.
To Alison now wol I tellen al
My luf-longing, for yet I shal nat misse°
That at the leste wey I shal hir kisse.
Som maner confort shal I have, parfay,
My mouth hath icched° al this longe day;
That is a signe of kissing atte leeste.
Al night me mette° eek, I was at a feeste.
Therfor I wol gon slepe an houre or tweye,
And al the night than wol I wake and pleye.”

¶Whan that the firste cok hath crowe, anon
Up rist this joly lovere Absolon,
And him arraieth gay,° at point-devis.°
But first he cheweth grain° and licoris,°
To smellen swete, er he had kembd° his heer.
Under his tonge a trewe love° he beer,
For therby wende° he to ben gracious.°
He rometh to the carpenteres hous,
And stille he stant under the shot-windowe;
Unto his brest it raughte,° it was so lowe;
And softe he cogheth with a semi-soun°—
“What do ye, honycomb, swete Alisoun?
My faire brid,° my swete cinamome,°
Awaketh, lemman min,° and spek to me!
Wel litel thenken ye upon my wo,
That for your love I swete° ther I go.
No wonder is thogh that I swelte and swete;°
I moorne° as doth a lamb after the tete.°
Ywis, lemman, I have swich luf-longinge,
That lik a turtel° trewe is my moorninge;
I may nat ete na more than a maide.”

¶“Go fro the window, Jakke fool,” she saide,
“As help me God, it wol nat be ‘com pa me,’°
I love another, and els° I were to blame,
Wel bet° than thee, by Jhesu, Absolon!
Go forth thy wey, or I wol caste a ston,
And lat me slepe, a twenty devel wey!”

¶“Allas,” quod Absolon, “and weilawey!
That trewe love was ever so ivel biset!°
Than kisse me, sin it may be no bet,
For Jesus love and for the love of me.”

¶“Wiltow than go thy wey therwith?” quod she.

¶“Ye, certes, lemman,” quod this Absolon.

¶“Than make thee redy,” quod she, “I come anon”;°
And unto Nicholas she seide stille,
“Now hust,° and thou shalt laughen al thy fille.”

¶This Absolon doun sette him on his knees,
And seide, “I am a lord at alle degrees;°
For after this I hope ther cometh more!
Lemman, thy grace, and swete brid, thin ore!”°

¶The window she undoth, and that in haste,
“Have do,” quod she, “com of,° and speed thee faste,
Lest that our neighebores thee espie.”

¶This Absolon gan wipe his mouth ful drie;
Derk was the night as pich, or as the cole,
And at the window out she putte hir hole,
And Absolon, him fil no bet ne wers,°
But with his mouth he kiste hir naked ers
Ful savourly,° er he was war of this.
Abak he sterte,° and thoghte it was amis,
For wel he wiste° a womman hath no berd;°
He felte a thing al rough and long yherd,°
And seide, “Fy! allas! what have I do?”

¶“Tehee!” quod she, and clapt the window to;
And Absolon goth forth a sory pas.

¶“A berd, a berd!” quod hende Nicholas,
“By Goddes corpus,° this goth faire and weel!”

¶This sely° Absolon herde every deel,°
And on his lippe he gan for anger bite;
And to himself he seide, “I shal thee quite!”°

¶Who rubbeth now, who froteth° now his lippes
With dust, with sond,° with straw, with clooth, with chippes,°
But Absolon, that seith ful ofte, “Allas!
My soul bitake° I unto Sathanas,
But me wer lever than° al this toun,” quod he,
“Of this despit° awroken° for to be!
Allas!” quod he, “allas! I nadde ybleint!”°
His hote love was cold and al yqueint;°
For fro that time that he had kiste hir ers,
Of paramours° he sette nat a kers,°
For he was heeled of his maladie;
Ful ofte paramours he gan deffie,°
And weep as dooth a child that is ybete.°
A softe paas he wente over the street
Until a smith° men cleped daun° Gerveis,
That in his forge smithed plough-harneis;°
He sharpeth shaar and cultour° bisily.
This Absolon knokketh al esily,°
And seide, “Undo,° Gerveis, and that anon.”

¶“What, who artow?” “It am I, Absolon.”
“What, Absolon! for Cristes swete tree,°
Why rise ye so rathe,° ey, benedicite!
What eileth yow?° som gay gerl,° God it woot,°
Hath broght yow thus upon the viritoot;°
By Seinte Noet, ye woot° wel what I mene.”

¶This Absolon ne roghte° nat a bene
Of al his pley,° no word again he yaf;°
He hadde more tow° on his distaf°
Than Gerveis knew, and seide, “Freend so dere,
That hote cultour in the chimenee° here,
As lene° it me, I have therwith to doone,°
And I wol bringe it thee again ful soone.”

¶Gerveis answerde, “Certes, were it gold,
Or in a poke° nobles° alle untold,°
Thou sholdest have, as I am trewe smith;
Ey, Cristes foo!° what wol ye do therwith?”

¶“Therof,” quod Absolon, “be as be may;
I shal wel telle it thee another day”—
And caught the cultour by the colde stele.°
Ful softe° out at the dore he gan to stele,°
And wente unto the carpenteres wal.
He cogheth first, and knokketh therwithal
Upon the window, right as he dide er.°

¶This Alison answerde, “Who is ther
That knokketh so? I warante it° a theef.”

¶“Why, nay,” quod he, “God woot,° my swete leef,°
I am thin Absolon, my dereling!
Of gold,” quod he, “I have thee broght a ring;
My moder yaf it me, so God me save,
Ful fin it is, and therto wel ygrave;°
This wol I yeve° thee, if thou me kisse!”

¶This Nicholas was risen for to pisse,
And thoghte he wolde amenden al the jape,°
He sholde kisse his ers er that he scape.°
And up the window dide he° hastily,
And out his ers he putteth prively
Over the buttok, to the haunche°-bon;
And therwith spak this clerk, this Absolon,
“Spek, swete brid,° I noot° nat wher thou art.”

¶This Nicholas anon leet flee a fart,
As greet as it had been a thonderdent,°
That with the strook he was almost yblent;°
And he was redy with his iren hoot,
And Nicholas amid the ers he smoot.°

¶Of° gooth the skin an handebrede° aboute,
The hote cultour brende° so his toute,°
That for the smert° he wende for to die.
As he were wood,° for wo he gan to crie—
“Help! Water! Water! Help! For Goddes herte!”

¶This carpenter out of his slomber sterte,
And herde oon cryen “Water!” as he were wood,
And thoghte, “Allas! now comth Nowelis° flood!”
He sit him up withouten wordes mo,
And with his ax he smoot the corde atwo,
And doun goth al; he fond neither to selle
Ne breed ne ale, til he cam to the celle°
Upon the floor; and ther aswowne° he lay.

¶Up sterte hir Alison, and Nicholay,
And criden “Out!”° and “Harrow!” in the strete.
The neighebores, bothe smale and grete,°
In ronnen, for to gauren° on this man,
That yet aswowne he lay, both pale and wan;
For with the fal he brosten° hadde his arm;
But stonde he moste° unto his owne harm.
For whan he spak, he was anon bore° doun
With° hende Nicholas and Alisoun.
They tolden every man that he was wood,°
He was agast so of “Nowelis flood”
Thurgh fantasie, that of his vanitee°
He hadde yboght him kneding-tubbes three,
And hadde hem hanged in the roof above;
And that he preyed hem, for Goddes love,
To sitten in the roof, par compaignie.°

¶The folk gan laughen at his fantasie;
Into the roof they kiken° and they gape,
And turned al his harm unto a jape.°
For what so° that this carpenter answerde,
It was for noght, no man his reson herde;
With othes° grete he was so sworn adoun,
That he was holden° wood° in al the toun;
For every clerk anonright heeld with other.
They seid, “The man is wood, my leve° brother”;
And every wight° gan laughen of this strif.°
Thus swived° was the carpenteres wif,
For° al his keping and his jalousie;
And Absolon hath kist hir nether° eye;
And Nicholas is scalded in the toute.°
This tale is doon, and God save al the route!°
