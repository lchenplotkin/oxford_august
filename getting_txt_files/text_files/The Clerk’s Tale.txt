¶“Sir Clerk of Oxenford,” our Hoste saide,
“Ye ride as coy° and stille° as dooth a maide,°
Were° newe spoused,° sitting at the bord;°
This day ne herde I of your tonge a word.
I trowe° ye studie aboute som sophime,°
But Salomon seith, ‘Every thing hath time.’
For Goddes sake, as beth of bettre chere,
It is no time for to studien here.
Telle us som mery tale, by your fey;
For what man that is entred in a pley,°
He nedes moot° unto the pley assente.
But precheth nat, as freres doon in Lente,
To make us for our olde sinnes wepe,
Ne that thy tale make us nat to slepe.
Telle us som mery thing of aventures;—
Your termes,° your colours, and your figures,°
Kepe hem in stoor° til so be ye endite
Heigh style, as whan that men to kinges write.
Speketh so plein at this time, we yow preye,
That we may understonde what ye seye.”

¶This worthy Clerk benignely° answerde,
“Hoste,” quod he, “I am under your yerde;°
Ye han of us as now the governaunce,
And therfor wol I do yow obeisaunce,°
As fer as reson axeth,° hardily.
I wol yow telle a tale which that I
Lerned at Padowe° of a worthy clerk,
As preved by his wordes and his werk.
He is now deed and nailed in his cheste,°
I prey to God so yeve his soule reste!
Fraunceis Petrark, the laureat° poete,
Highte this clerk,° whos rethorike sweete
Enlumined al Itaille of° poetrie,
As Linian° dide of philosophie
Or lawe, or other art particuler;
But deeth, that wol nat suffre us dwellen heer
But as it were a twinkling of an eye,
Hem bothe hath slain, and alle shul we die.
But forth to tellen of this worthy man,
That taughte me this tale, as I bigan,
I seye that first with heigh style he enditeth,°
Er he the body of his tale writeth,
A proheme,° in the which discriveth he
Pemond,° and of Saluces° the contree,
And speketh of Apennin,° the hilles hie,
That been the boundes of West Lumbardie,
And of Mount Vesulus in special,
Where as the Poo,° out of a welle° smal,
Taketh his firste springing and his sours,
That estward ay encresseth in his cours
To Emelward,° to Ferrare, and Venise:
The which a long thing were to devise.
And trewely, as to my jugement,
Me thinketh it a thing impertinent,°
Save that he wol conveien° his matere:
But this his tale, which that ye may here.”

Ther is, at the west side of Itaille,
Doun at the rote° of Vesulus the colde,
A lusty° plaine, habundant of vitaille,°
Wher many a tour and toun thou mayst biholde,
That founded were in time of fadres olde,
And many another delitable sighte,
And Saluces this noble contree highte.

A markis° whilom° lord was of that londe,
As were his worthy eldres him bifore;
And obeisant ay redy to his honde
Were alle his liges,° bothe lasse and more.
Thus in delit he liveth, and hath don yore,°
Biloved and drad,° thurgh favour of fortune,
Bothe of his lordes and of his commune.°

Therwith he was, to speke as of linage,°
The gentilleste° yborn of Lumbardie,
A fair persone, and strong, and yong of age,
And ful of honour and of curteisie;
Discreet° ynogh his contree for to gie,
Save in somme thinges that he was to blame,
And Walter was this yonge lordes name.

I blame him thus, that he considereth noght
In time cominge what mighte him bitide,°
But on his lust present° was al his thoght,
As for to hauke° and hunte on every side;
Wel ny alle othere cures° leet he slide,°
And eek he nolde,° and that was worst of alle,
Wedde no wif, for noght that may bifalle.

Only that point his peple bar so sore,
That flokmele° on a day they to him wente,
And oon of hem, that wisest was of lore,
Or elles that the lord best wolde assente
That he sholde telle him what his peple mente,
Or elles coude he shew wel swich° matere,
He to the markis seide as ye shul here.

“O noble markis, your humanitee°
Assureth us and yeveth° us hardinesse,°
As ofte as time is of necessitee
That we to yow mowe° telle our hevinesse;°
Accepteth, lord, now for your gentillesse,
That we with pitous herte unto yow pleine,°
And lat your eres nat my vois disdeine.

Al have I noght to done° in this matere
More than another man hath in this place,
Yet for as muche as ye, my lord so dere,
Han alwey shewed me favour and grace,
I dar the better aske of yow a space
Of audience, to shewen our requeste,
And ye, my lord, to doon right as yow leste.°

For certes, lord, so wel us liketh yow
And al your werk and ever han doon, that we
Ne coude nat us self devisen how
We mighte liven in more felicitee,
Save o thing, lord, if it your wille be,
That for to been a wedded man yow leste,°
Than were your peple in soverein hertes reste.

Boweth your nekke under that blisful yok°
Of soverainetee, noght of servise,
Which that men clepe spousaille or wedlok;
And thenketh, lord, among your thoghtes wise,
How that our dayes passe in sondry° wise;
For though we slepe or wake, or rome, or ride,
Ay fleeth the time, it nil no man abide.

And though your grene youthe floure as yit,°
In crepeth age alwey, as stille° as stoon,
And deeth manaceth° every age, and smit°
In ech estaat,° for ther escapeth noon:
And also certein as we knowe echoon
That we shul deie, as uncertein we alle
Been of that day whan deeth shal on us falle.

Accepteth than of us the trewe entente,
That° never yet refuseden your heste,°
And we wol, lord, if that ye wol assente,
Chese yow a wif in short time, atte leste,°
Born of the gentilleste and of the meste°
Of al this lond, so that it oghte seme
Honour to God and yow, as we can deme.°

Deliver us out of al this bisy drede,°
And tak a wif, for hye Goddes sake;
For if it so bifelle, as God forbede,
That thurgh your deeth your linage sholde slake,°
And that a straunge successour shold take
Your heritage, O! wo were us alive!
Wherfor we pray you hastily to wive.”

Hir° meke preiere and hir pitous chere°
Made the markis herte han pitee.
“Ye wol,” quod he, “min owene peple dere,
To that° I never erst° thoghte streine° me.
I me rejoised of my libertee,
That selde time is founde in mariage;
Ther° I was free, I moot been in servage.

But nathelees I see your trewe entente,
And truste upon your wit, and have don ay;°
Wherfor of my free wil I wol assente
To wedde me, as sone as ever I may.
But theras ye han profred me today
To chese me a wif, I yow relesse
That chois, and prey yow of that profre cesse.

For God it woot,° that children ofte been
Unlik her worthy eldres hem bifore;
Bountee comth al of God, nat of the streen°
Of which they been engendred and ybore;
I truste in Goddes bountee, and therfore
My mariage and min estaat and reste
I him° bitake;° he may don as him leste.

Lat me alone in chesinge° of my wif,
That charge upon my bak I wol endure;
But I yow preye, and charge upon your lif,
That what wif that I take, ye me assure
To worshipe° hir, whil that hir lif may dure,
In word and werk, bothe here and everywhere,
As she an emperoures doghter were.

And forthermore, this shal ye swere, that ye
Again my chois shul neither grucche° ne strive;°
For sith I shal forgoon° my libertee
At your requeste, as ever moot I thrive,°
Ther as° min herte is set, ther wol I wive;
And but ye wole assente in swich manere,
I prey yow, speketh namore of this matere.”

With hertly° wil they sworen, and assenten
To al this thing, ther seide no wight nay;
Bisekinge him of grace, er that they wenten,
That he wolde graunten hem a certein day
Of his spousaille, as sone as ever he may;
For yet alwey the peple somwhat dredde°
Lest that this markis no wif wolde wedde.

He graunted hem a day, swich as him leste,
On which he wolde be wedded sikerly,°
And seide, he dide al this at hir requeste;
And they, with humble entente,° buxomly,°
Knelinge upon her knees ful reverently
Him thanken alle, and thus they han an ende
Of hir entente,° and hoom again they wende.°

And heerupon he to his officeres
Comaundeth for the feste° to purveie,°
And to his privee° knightes and squieres
Swich charge yaf,° as him liste on hem leye;°
And they to his comandement obeye,
And ech of hem doth al his diligence
To doon unto the feste reverence.

Noght fer fro thilke paleis honurable°
Theras° this markis shoop° his mariage,
Ther stood a throp,° of site delitable,
In which that povre folk of that village
Hadden hir bestes and hir herbergage,°
And of hir labour took hir sustenance
After that° the erthe yaf hem habundance.

Amonges thise povre folk ther dwelte a man
Which that was holden povrest of hem alle;
But hye God som time senden can
His grace into a litel oxes stalle:
Janicula men of that throp° him calle.
A doghter hadde he, fair ynogh to sighte,
And Grisildis this yonge maiden highte.°

But for to speke of vertuous beaute,
Than was she oon the faireste under sonne;
For povreliche yfostred up° was she,
No likerous lust° was thurgh hir herte yronne;
Wel ofter° of the welle than of the tonne°
She drank, and for she wolde vertu plese,
She knew wel labour, but non idel ese.

But thogh this maide tendre were of age,
Yet in the brest of hir virginitee
Ther was enclosed ripe and sad corage;°
And in greet reverence and charitee
Hir olde povre fader fostred she;°
A fewe sheepe spinning on feeld she kepte,
She wolde noght been idel til she slepte.

And whan she hoomward cam, she wolde bringe
Wortes° or othere herbes times ofte,
The whiche she shredde° and seeth° for hir livinge,°
And made hir bed ful harde and nothing softe;
And ay she kepte hir fadres lif onlofte°
With everich obeisaunce and diligence
That child may doon to fadres reverence.

Upon Grisilde, this poor creature,
Ful ofte sithe° this markis sette his eye
As he on hunting rood paraventure;°
And whan it fil that he mighte hir espie,
He noght with wantoun° loking of folie
His eyen caste on hir, but in sad wise°
Upon hir chere° he wolde him ofte avise,°

Commending in his herte hir wommanhede,
And eek° hir vertu, passing° any wight°
Of so yong age, as wel in chere as dede.°
For thogh the peple have no greet insight
In vertu, he considered ful right
Hir bountee,° and disposed that he wolde
Wedde hir only, if ever he wedde sholde.

The day of wedding cam, but no wight can
Telle what womman that it sholde be;
For which merveille wondred many a man,
And seiden, whan they were in privetee,
“Wol nat our lord yet leve his vanitee?°
Wol he nat wedde? allas, allas the while!
Why wol he thus himself and us bigile?”°

But natheles this markis hath don make°
Of gemmes, set in gold and in asure,°
Broches° and ringes, for Grisildis sake,
And of hir clothing took he the mesure
By a maide, lik to hir stature,
And eek of othere ornamentes alle
That unto swich a wedding sholde falle.

The time of undern° of the same day
Approcheth, that this wedding sholde be;
And al the paleis put was in array,
Bothe halle and chambres,° ech in his degree;
Houses of office stuffed with plentee
Ther maystow seen of deinteuous vitaille,°
That may be founde, as fer as last Itaille.°

This royal markis, richely arrayed,
Lordes and ladies in his companie,
The whiche unto the feste were yprayed,°
And of his retenue the bachelrie,°
With many a soun of sondry° melodie,
Unto the village, of the which I tolde,
In this array the righte wey han holde.

Grisilde of this, God woot,° ful innocent,
That for hir shapen was al this array,
To fecchen water at a welle is went,
And cometh hoom as sone as ever she may.
For wel she had herd seid, that thilke° day
The markis sholde wedde, and, if she mighte,
She wolde fain han sein som of that sighte.

She thoghte, “I wol with othere maidens stonde,
That been my felawes, in our dore,° and see
The markisesse,° and therfor wol I fonde°
To doon at hoom, as sone as it may be,
The labour° which that longeth° unto me;
And than I may at leiser hir biholde,
If she this wey unto the castel holde.”

And as she wolde over hir threshfold goon,
The markis cam and gan hir for to calle;
And she sette doun hir water-pot anoon
Biside the threshfold,° in an oxes stalle,
And doun upon hir knees she gan to falle,
And with sad° contenance kneleth stille
Til she had herd what was the lordes wille.

This thoghtful° markis spak unto this maide
Ful sobrely, and seide in this manere,
“Wher is your fader, Grisildis?” he saide,
And she with reverence, in humble chere,°
Answerde, “Lord, he is al redy here.”
And in she gooth with-outen lenger lette,°
And to the markis she hir fader fette.°

He by the hond than took this olde man,
And seide thus, whan he him hadde aside,
“Janicula, I neither may ne can
Lenger the plesance of min herte hide.
If that thou vouche-sauf, whatso° bitide,°
Thy doghter wol I take, er that I wende,°
As for my wif, unto hir lives ende.

Thou lovest me, I woot it wel, certein,
And art my feithful lige man ybore;
And al that liketh me, I dar wel seyn
It liketh thee, and specially therfore
Tel me that point that I have seid bifore,
If that thou wolt unto that purpos drawe,
To take me as for thy sone-in-lawe?”

This sodein cas this man astoned° so,
That reed he wex,° abaist, and al quaking°
He stood unnethes° seide he wordes mo,
But only thus: “Lord,” quod he, “my willing
Is as ye wole,° ne ayeines° your liking
I wol no thing; ye be my lord so dere;
Right as yow lust° governeth this matere.”

“Yet wol I,” quod this markis softely,
“That in thy chambre I and thou and she
Have a collacion,° and wostow why?
For I wol axe if it hir wille be
To be my wif, and reule hir after me;°
And al this shal be doon in thy presence,
I wol noght speke out of thin audience.”°

And in the chambre whil they were aboute
Hir tretis,° which as ye shal after here,
The peple cam unto the hous withoute,°
And wondred hem in° how honest° manere
And tentifly° she kepte hir fader dere.
But outerly° Grisildis wondre mighte,
For never erst ne saugh she swich a sighte.

No wonder is thogh that she were astoned°
To seen so greet a gest° come in that place;°
She never was to swiche° gestes woned,°
For which she loked with ful pale face.
But shortly forth this tale for to chace,°
Thise arn the wordes that the markis sayde
To this benigne verray feithful maide.

“Grisilde,” he seide, “ye shul wel understonde
It liketh to your fader and to° me
That I yow wedde, and eek it may so stonde,
As I suppose, ye wol° that it so be.
But thise demandes° axe° I first,” quod he,
“That, sith it shal be doon in hastif wise,°
Wol ye assente, or elles yow avise?°

I sey this, be ye redy° with good herte
To al my lust,° and that I frely may,
As me best thinketh, do° yow laughe or smerte,°
And never ye to grucche it,° night ne day?
And eek whan I sey ‘ye,’ ne sey nat ‘nay,’
Neither by word ne frowning contenance;
Swer this, and here I swere oure alliance.”°

Wondring upon this word, quaking for drede,°
She seide, “Lord, undigne° and unworthy
Am I to thilke° honour that ye me bede;°
But as ye wol yourself, right so wol° I.
And heer I swere that never willingly
In werk ne thoght I nil yow disobeye,
For to be deed,° though me were looth° to deie.”

“This is ynogh,° Grisilde min!” quod he.
And forth he gooth with a ful sobre chere°
Out at the dore, and after that cam she,
And to the peple he seide in this manere,
“This is my wif,” quod he, “that standeth here.
Honoureth hir, and loveth hir, I preye,
Whoso me loveth; ther is namore to seye.”

And for° that no thing of hir olde gere°
She sholde bringe into his hous, he bad
That wommen sholde dispoilen° hir right there;
Of which thise ladies were nat right glad
To handle hir clothes wherin she was clad.
But natheles this maide bright of hewe
Fro foot to heed they clothed han al newe.

Hir heres° han they kembd, that lay untressed°
Ful rudely, and with hir fingres smale°
A corone° on hir heed they han ydressed,°
And sette hir ful of nowches° grete and smale;
Of hir array what° sholde I make a tale?°
Unnethe° the peple hir knew for hir fairnesse,
Whan she translated° was in swich richesse.

This markis hath hir spoused° with a ring
Broght for the same cause, and than hir sette
Upon an hors, snow whit and wel ambling,°
And to his paleis, er° he lenger lette,°
With joyful peple that hir ladde and mette,
Conveied hir, and thus the day they spende
In revel,° til the sonne gan descende.

And shortly forth this tale for to chace,
I say that to this newe markisesse°
God hath swich favour sent hir of his grace,
That it ne semed nat by liklinesse
That she was born and fed in rudenesse,°
As in a cote° or in an oxe-stalle,
But norished° in an emperoures halle.

To every wight° she woxen is° so dere
And worshipful,° that folk ther she was bore°
And from hir birthe knewe° hir yeer by yere,
Unnethe trowed they,° but dorste han swore
That to Janicle, of which I spak bifore,
She doghter nas, for, as by conjecture,°
Hem thoughte she was another creature.

For thogh that ever vertuous was she,
She was encressed in swich excellence
Of thewes° gode, yset in heigh bountee,°
And so discreet and fair of eloquence,
So benigne and so digne of reverence,
And coude so the peples herte embrace,
That ech hir loved that loked on hir face.

Noght only of Saluces in the toun
Publiced was° the bountee of hir name,
But eek biside° in many a regioun,
If oon seide wel, another seide the same;
So spradde of hire heigh bountee the fame,
That men and wommen, as wel yonge as olde,
Gon to Saluce, upon hir to biholde.°

Thus Walter lowly, nay but royally,
Wedded with fortunat honestetee,°
In Goddes pees liveth ful esily
At hoom, and outward grace ynogh° had he;
And for he saugh that under low degree
Was ofte vertu hid, the peple him helde
A prudent man, and that is seyn° ful selde.°

Nat only this Grisildis thurgh hir wit
Coude° al the feet° of wifly hoomlinesse,°
But eek, whan that the cas required it,
The commune profit° coude she redresse.
Ther nas discord, rancour, ne hevinesse °
In al that lond, that she ne coude apese,°
And wisly bringe hem alle in reste and ese.

Though that hir housbonde absent were anoon,
If gentil° men, or othere of hir contree
Were wrothe,° she wold bringen hem atoon;°
So° wise and ripe° wordes hadde she,
And jugements of so greet equitee,°
That she from heven sent was, as men wende,
Peple to save and every wrong t’amende.°

Nat longe time after that this Grisild
Was wedded, she a doughter hath ybore,
Al had° hir lever° have born a knave° child.
Glad was this markis and the folk therfore;
For though a maide child come al bifore,
She may unto a knave child atteine
By liklihed, sin she nis nat bareine.

Ther fil, as it bifalleth times mo,
Whan that this child had souked° but a throwe,°
This markis in his herte longeth so
To tempte° his wif, hir sadness° for to knowe,
That he ne mighte out of his herte throwe
This merveillous° desir, his wif t’assaye,°
Needless, God woot,° he thoughte hir for t’affraie.°

He hadde assayed hir ynogh bifore,
And fond hir ever good; what neded it
Hir for to tempte and alwey more and more?
Though som men preise it for a subtil wit,
But as for me, I seye that ivel° it sit°
T’assaye a wif whan that it is no nede,
And putten her in anguish and in drede.

For which this markis wroghte in this manere;
He cam alone anight, ther as she lay,
With sterne face and with ful trouble chere,
And seide thus, “Grisild,” quod he, “that day
That I yow took out of your povre array,
And putte yow in estaat of heigh noblesse,
Ye have nat that forgeten, as I gesse.

I seye, Grisild, this present dignitee,
In which that I have put yow, as I trowe,°
Maketh yow nat foryetful for to be
That I yow took in povre estaat ful lowe
For° any wele ye moot yourselven knowe.
Tak hede° of every word that I yow seye,
Ther is no wight that hereth it but we tweie.°

Ye woot yourself wel, how that ye cam here
Into this hous, it is nat longe ago,
And though to me that ye be lief° and dere,
Unto my gentils° ye be nothing so;
They seyn, to hem it is greet shame and wo
For to be subgets and ben in servage
To thee, that born art of a smal village.

And namely,° sith thy doghter was ybore,
Thise wordes han they spoken doutelees;
But I desire, as I have doon bifore,
To live my lif with hem in reste and pees;
I may nat in this caas be recchelees.°
I moot° don with thy doghter for the beste,
Nat as I wolde, but as my peple leste.°

And yet, God wot, this is ful looth to me;
But nathelees withoute your witing°
I wol nat doon, but this° wol I,” quod he,
“That ye to me assente as in this thing.
Shew now your pacience in your werking
That ye me highte° and swore in your village
That day that maked was our mariage.”

Whan she had herd al this, she noght ameved°
Neither in word, or chere, or countenaunce;
For, as it semed, she was nat agreved:°
She seide, “Lord, al lith in your plesaunce,
My child and I with hertly obeisaunce
Ben youres al, and ye mowe save or spille°
Your owene thing;° werketh after your wille.

Ther may no thing, God so my soule save,
Liken to° yow that may displese me;
Ne I desire no thing for to have,
Ne drede for to lese, save only ye;
This wil is in min herte and ay° shal be.
No lengthe of time or deeth may this deface,
Ne chaunge my corage° to another place.”

Glad was this markis of hir answering,
But yet he feined as he were nat so;
Al drery° was his chere and his loking
Whan that he sholde out of the chambre° go.
Sone after this, a furlong wey° or two,
He prively hath told al his entente
Unto a man, and to his wif him sente.

A maner sergeant° was this privee man,°
The which that feithful ofte he founden hadde
In thinges grete, and eek swich folk wel can
Don execucioun on thinges badde.°
The lord knew wel that he him loved and dradde;°
And whan this sergeant wiste° his lordes wille,
Into the chambre he stalked him ful stille.°

“Madame,” he seide, “ye mot foryeve it me,
Thogh I do thing to which I am constreined;
Ye ben so wis that ful wel knowe ye
That lordes hestes mowe° nat been yfeined;°
They mow wel been biwailled° or compleined,
But men mot nede unto her lust° obeye,
And so wol I; ther is namore to seye.

This child I am comanded for to take”—
And spak namore, but out the child he hente°
Despitously,° and gan a chere° make
As though he wolde han slain it er° he wente.
Grisildis mot al suffren° and consente;
And as a lamb she sitteth meke and stille,
And leet this cruel sergeant doon his wille.

Suspecious was the diffame° of this man,
Suspect his face, suspect his word also;
Suspect the time in which he this bigan.
Allas! hir doghter that she loved so
She wende° he wolde han slawen it right tho.°
But natheles she neither weep ne siked,°
Consenting hir to that the markis liked.°

But atte laste speken she bigan,
And mekely she to the sergeant preide,
So as he was a worthy gentil man,
That she most kisse hir child er that it deide;°
And in her barm° this litel child she leide
With ful sad face, and gan the child to kisse
And lulled it, and after gan it blisse.°

And thus she seide in hir benigne vois,
“Far weel, my child; I shal thee never see.
But, sith I thee have marked with the crois,
Of thilke fader blessed mote he be,
That for us deide upon a crois of tree.
Thy soule, litel child, I him bitake,°
For this night shaltow dien for my sake.”

I trow that to° a norice° in this cas
It had ben hard this rewthe° for to se;
Wel mighte a mooder than han cried “Allas!”
But nathelees so sad° stedfast was she,
That she endured all adversitee,
And to the sergeant mekely she saide,
“Have heer again your litel yonge maide.°

Goth now,” quod she, “and dooth my lordes heste,°
But o thing wol I pray yow of your grace,
That, but° my lord forbad° yow, atte leste
Burieth this litel body in som place
That bestes ne no briddes it torace.”°
But he no word wol to that purpos° seye,
But took the child and wente upon his weye.

This sergeant cam unto his lord agein,
And of Grisildis wordes and hir chere
He tolde him point for point, in short and plain,
And him presenteth with his doghter dere.
Somwhat this lord hath rewthe in his manere;
But nathelees his purpos heeld he stille,
As lordes doon, whan they wol han hir wille;

And bad his sergeant that he prively
Shold this child ful softe° winde and wrappe°
With alle circumstances° tendrely,
And carie it in a cofre° or in a lappe;°
But, upon peine° his heed of for to swappe,°
That no man sholde knowe of his entente,
Ne whenne° he cam, ne whider that he wente;

But at Boloigne° he to his suster dere,
That thilke time of Panik° was countesse,
He sholde it take, and shewe hir this matere,
Bisekinge hir to don hir bisinesse
This child to fostre° in alle gentilesse;
And whos child that it was he bad hir hide
From every wight, for oght that may bitide.°

The sergeant gooth, and hath fulfild this thing;
But to this markis now retourne we;
For now goth he ful faste imagining
If by his wives chere he mighte see,
Or by hir word aperceive that she
Were chaunged; but he never hir coud finde
But ever in oon ylike sad° and kinde.

As glad, as humble, as bisy in servise,
And eek in love as she was wont to be,
Was she to him in every maner wise;
Ne of hir doghter noght a word spak she.
Non accident° for° noon adversitee
Was sein in hir, ne never hir doghter name
Ne nempned she, in ernest nor in game.°

In this estaat ther passed been four yeer
Er she with childe was; but, as God wolde,°
A knave° child she bar by this Walter,
Ful gracious and fair for to biholde.
And whan that folk it to his fader tolde,
Nat only he, but al his contree, merie
Was for this child, and God they thanke and herie.°

Whan it was two yeer old, and fro the brest
Departed of his norice,° on a day
This markis caughte yet another lest°
To tempte his wif yet ofter,° if he may.
O needles was she tempted in assay!°
But wedded men ne knowe no mesure,
Whan that they finde a pacient creature.

“Wif,” quod this markis, “ye han herd er this,
My peple sikly berth° our mariage,
And namely, sith my sone yboren is,
Now is it wors than ever° in al our age.°
The murmur° sleeth° min herte and my corage;°
For to mine eres comth the vois so smerte,°
That it wel ny destroyed hath min herte.

Now sey they thus, ‘Whan Walter is agoon,
Then shal the blood of Janicle succede
And been our lord, for other have we noon’;
Swiche wordes seith my peple, out of drede.°
Wel oughte I of swich murmur taken hede;
For certeinly I drede swich sentence,°
Though they nat plein speke in min audience.°

I wolde live in pees, if that I mighte;
Wherfor I am disposed outerly,°
As I his suster servede° by nighte,
Right so thenke I to serve him prively;°
This warne I yow, that ye nat sodeinly
Out of yourself for no wo sholde outraye;°
Beth pacient, and therof I yow preye.”

“I have,” quod she, “seid thus, and ever shal,
I wol no thing, ne nil no thing, certain,
But as yow list; noght greveth me at al,
Thogh that my doghter and my sone be slain,
At your comandement, this is to sayn.
I have noght had no part of children tweine
But first siknesse, and after wo and peine.

Ye been our lord, doth with your owne thing
Right as yow list; axeth no reed° at° me.
For, as I lefte at hoom al my clothing,
Whan I first cam to yow, right so,” quod she,
“Left I my wil and al my libertee,
And took your clothing; wherfor I yow preye,
Doth your plesaunce,° I wol your lust° obeye.

“And certes, if I hadde prescience
Your wil to knowe er° ye your lust me tolde,
I wolde it doon withouten necligence;
But now I woot your lust and what ye wolde,
Al your plesaunce ferme and stable I holde;
For wiste I° that my deeth wolde do yow ese,°
Right gladly wolde I dien,° yow to plese.

Deth may noght make no comparisoun
Unto your love”: and, whan this markis sey°
The constance of his wif, he caste adoun
His eyen two, and wondreth that she may°
In pacience suffre al this array.°
And forth he gooth with drery° contenaunce,
But to his herte it was ful greet plesaunce.

This ugly° sergeant, in the same wise
That he hir doghter caughte, right so he,
Or worse, if men worse can devise,
Hath hent hir son that ful was of beautee.
And ever in oon so pacient was she,
That she no chere° made of hevinesse,
But kiste hir sone, and after gan it blesse;

Save this; she preyed him that, if he mighte,
Hir litel sone he wolde in erthe grave,
His tendre limes, delicat to sighte,
Fro foules and fro bestes for to save.
But she non answer of him mighte have.
He wente his wey, as him no thing ne roghte;°
But to Boloigne he tendrely it broghte.

This markis wondreth° ever lenger the more
Upon hir pacience, and if that he
Ne hadde soothly knowen therbifore,
That parfitly hir children loved she,
He wolde have wend° that of° som subtiltee,°
And of malice or for cruel corage,
That she had suffred this with sad° visage.

But wel he knew that next himself, certain,
She loved hir children best in every wise.
But now of wommen wolde I axen° fain,°
If thise assayes mighte nat suffise?
What coude a sturdy° housbond more devise
To preve hir wifhod and hir stedfastnesse,
And he continuing ever in sturdinesse?°

But ther ben folk of swich condicioun,
That, whan they have a certein purpos take,
They can nat stinte° of hir entencioun,
But, right as° they were bounden to a stake,
They wol nat of that firste purpos slake.°
Right so this markis fulliche hath purposed
To tempte his wif, as he was first disposed.

He waiteth,° if by word or contenance°
That she to him was changed of corage;
But never coude he finde variance;
She was ay oon° in herte and in visage;
And ay the forther that she was in age,
The more trewe, if that it were possible,
She was to him in love, and more penible.°

For which it semed thus, that of hem two
Ther nas but o wil; for, as Walter leste,
The same lust was hir plesance also,
And, God be thanked, al fil for the beste.
She shewed wel, for no worldly unreste°
A wif, as of hirself, no thing ne sholde
Wille° in effect, but as hir housbond wolde.

The sclaundre of° Walter ofte and wide spradde,
That of a cruel herte he wikkedly,
For° he a povre womman wedded hadde,
Hath mordred bothe his children prively.
Swich murmur was among hem comunly.
No wonder is, for to the peples ere
Ther cam no word but that they mordred were.

For which, wheras his peple therbifore
Had loved him wel, the sclaundre° of his diffame°
Made hem that they him hatede therfore;
To been a mordrer is an hateful name.
But natheles, for ernest ne for game°
He of his cruel purpos nolde stente;°
To tempte his wif was set al his entente.

Whan that his doghter twelf yeer was of age,
He to the court of Rome, in subtil wise
Enformed of his wil, sente his message,°
Comaunding hem swich bulles° to devise
As to his cruel purpos may suffise,
How that the Pope, as for his peples reste,°
Bad him to wedde another, if him leste.

I seye, he bad they sholde countrefete°
The Popes bulles, making mencioun
That he hath leve° his firste wif to lete,°
As by the Popes dispensacioun,
To stinte° rancour and dissencioun
Bitwixe° his peple and him; thus seid the bulle,
The which they han publiced° atte fulle.

The rude° peple, as it no wonder is,
Wenden° ful wel that it had been right so;
But whan thise tidinges° cam to Grisildis,
I deme° that hir herte was ful wo.
But she, ylike sad° for evermo,
Disposed was, this humble creature,
Th’adversitee of fortune al t’endure.

Abiding° ever his lust and his plesaunce,
To whom that she was yeven,° herte and al,
As to hir verray worldly suffisaunce;°
But shortly if this storie I tellen shal,
This markis writen hath in special
A lettre in which he sheweth his entente,
And secrely he to Boloigne it sente.

To the erl° of Panik, which that hadde tho°
Wedded his suster, preide he specially
To bringen hoom again his children two
In honurable estaat al openly.
But o° thing he him preiede outerly,°
That he to no wight, though men wolde enquere,
Sholde nat telle, whos children that they were,

But sey the maiden sholde ywedded be
Unto the markis of Saluce anon.°
And as this erl was preyed, so dide he;
For at day set° he on his wey is goon
Toward Saluce, and lordes many oon,
In riche array, this maiden for to gide;°
Hir yonge brother riding hir biside.

Arrayed was toward° hir mariage
This fresshe maide, ful of gemmes clere;
Hir brother, which that seven yeer was of age,
Arrayed eek ful fresh in his manere.
And thus in greet noblesse and with glad chere,
Toward Saluces shaping° hir journey,
Fro day to day they riden in hir wey.

Among al this, after his wikke usage,°
This markis, yet his wif to tempte more
To the uttereste preve of hir corage,
Fully to han experience and lore°
If that she were as stedfast as bifore,
He on a day in open audience°
Ful boistously° hath seid hir this sentence:

“Certes, Grisilde, I hadde ynough plesaunce
To han yow to my wif for your goodnesse,
As for your trouthe° and for your obeisaunce,
Nought for your linage ne for your richesse;
But now knowe I in verray soothfastnesse
That in gret lordshipe, if I wel avise,
Ther is gret servitute in sondry wise.°

I may nat don as every plowman may;
My peple me constreineth for to take
Another wif, and cryen day by day;
And eek the pope, rancour for to slake,°
Consenteth it, that dar I undertake;°
And treweliche thus muche I wol yow seye,
My newe wif is coming by the weye.

Be strong of herte, and voide° anon hir place,
And thilke dower° that ye broghten me
Tak it again, I graunte it of my grace;
Retourneth to your fadres hous,” quod he;
“No man may alwey han prosperitee;
With evene° herte I rede° yow t’endure°
The strook of fortune or of aventure.”

And she answerde again in pacience,
“My lord,” quod she, “I woot, and wiste° alway
How that bitwixen your magnificence
And my poverte no wight can ne may
Maken comparison; it is no nay.°
I ne heeld me never digne° in no manere
To be your wif, no, ne your chamberere.°

And in this hous, ther ye me lady made—
The heighe God take I for my witnesse,
And also wisly° he my soule glade—
I never heeld me lady ne maistresse,
But humble servant to your worthinesse,
And evere shal, whil that my lif may dure,
Aboven every worldly creature.

That ye so longe of your benignitee
Han holden me in honour and nobleie,°
Wheras I was noght worthy for to be,
That thonke I God and yow, to whom I preye
Foryelde° it yow; there is namore to seye.
Unto my fader gladly wol I wende,
And with him dwelle unto my lives ende.

Ther° I was fostred° of a child ful smal,
Til I be deed, my lif ther wol I lede
A widwe clene, in body, herte, and al.
For sith° I yaf to yow my maidenhede,°
And am your trewe wif, it is no drede,
God shilde swich a lordes wif to take
Another man to housbonde or to make.°

And of your newe wif, God of his grace
So graunte yow wele° and prosperitee:
For I wol gladly yelden hir my place,
In which that I was blisful wont to be,
For sith it liketh yow, my lord,” quod she,
“That whilom° weren al min hertes reste,
That I shal goon, I wol gon whan yow leste.

But theras ye me profre swich dowaire
As I first broghte, it is wel in my minde
It were my wrecched clothes, no thing faire,
The which to me were hard now for to finde.
O gode God! how gentil and how kinde
Ye semed by your speche and your visage
The day that maked was our mariage!

But sooth is seid, algate I finde it trewe—
For in effect it preved° is on me—
Love is noght old as whan that it is newe.
But certes, lord, for noon adversitee,
To dyen in the cas,° it shal nat be
That ever in word or werk I shal repente
That I yow yaf min herte in hool entente.

My lord, ye woot that, in my fadres place,
Ye dede me strepe out of my povre wede,°
And richely me cladden, of your grace.
To yow broghte I noght elles, out of drede,
But feith and nakednesse and maidenhede.
And here again my clothing I restore,
And eek my wedding-ring, for evermore.

The remenant of your jewels redy be
Inwith your chambre, dar I saufly sayn;
Naked out of my fadres hous,” quod she,
“I cam, and naked moot I turne again.
Al your plesaunce wol I folwen fain;
But yet I hope it be nat your entente
That I smoklees° out of your paleis wente.

Ye coude nat doon so dishoneste° a thing,
That thilke° wombe in which your children leie
Shold, biforn the peple, in my walking,
Be seyn al bare; wherfor I yow preye,
Lat me nat lik a worm go by the weye.
Remembre yow, min owne lord so dere,
I was your wif, thogh I unworthy were.

Wherfor, in guerdon° of my maidenhede,
Which that I broghte, and noght again I bere,
As voucheth sauf to yeve me, to my mede,°
But swich a smok as I was wont to were,
That I therwith may wrie° the wombe of here
That was your wif; and heer take I my leve
Of yow, min owne lord, lest I yow greve.”

“The smok,” quod he, &apos;that thou hast on thy bak,
Lat it be stille, and ber it forth with thee.”
But wel unnethes° thilke word he spak,
But wente his wey for rewthe and for pitee.
Biforn the folk hirselven strepeth she,
And in hir smok, with heed and foot al bare,
Toward hir fader hous forth is she fare.°

The folk hir folwe wepinge in hir weye,
And fortune ay they cursen as they goon;
But she fro weping kepte hir eyen dreie,°
Ne in this time word ne spak she noon.
Hir fader, that this tiding herde anoon,
Curseth the day and time that nature
Shoop° him to been a lives creature.°

For out of doute this olde povre man
Was ever in suspect of hir mariage;
For ever he demed, sith that it bigan,
That whan the lord fulfild had his corage,°
Him wolde thinke it were a disparage°
To his estaat so lowe for t’alighte,°
And voiden hir° as sone as ever he mighte.

Agains° his doghter hastilich goth he,
For he by noise of folk knew hir cominge,
And with hir olde cote,° as it might be,
He covered hir, ful sorwefully wepinge;
But on hir body mighte he it nat bringe.
For rude° was the cloth, and more of age°
By dayes fele° than hir mariage.

Thus with hir fader, for a certein space,
Dwelleth this flour of wifly pacience,
That neither by hir wordes ne hir face
Biforn the folk, ne eek in hir absence,
Ne shewed she that hir° was doon offence;°
Ne of hir heigh estaat no remembraunce
Ne hadde she, as by hir countenaunce.

No wonder is, for in hir grete estaat
Hir goost° was ever in plein humilitee;
No tendre mouth, non herte delicaat,
No pompe, no semblant of royaltee,
But ful of pacient benignitee,
Discreet and prideles, ay honurable,
And to hir housbonde ever meke and stable.

Men speke of Job and most for his humblesse,°
As clerkes, whan hem list, can wel endite,
Namely of men, but as in soothfastnesse,
Thogh clerkes preise wommen but a lite,
Ther can no man in humblesse him acquite°
As womman can, ne can ben half so trewe
As wommen been, but it be falle of newe.°

Fro Boloigne is this erl of Panik come,
Of which the fame upsprang to more and lesse,°
And in the peples eres alle and some
Was couth° eek, that a newe markisesse
He with him broghte, in swich pompe and richesse,
That never was ther seyn with mannes eye
So noble array in al West Lumbardie.

The markis, which that shoop° and knew al this,
Er that this erl was come, sente his message
For thilke sely° povre Grisildis;
And she with humble herte and glad visage,
Nat with no swollen thoght in hir corage,
Cam at his heste, and on hir knees hir sette,
And reverently° and wisly° she him grette.°

“Grisild,” quod he, “my wille is outerly,°
This maiden, that shal wedded been to me,
Received be tomorwe as royally
As it possible is in min hous to be.
And eek that every wight° in his degree
Have his estaat in sitting and servise
And heigh° plesaunce, as I can best devise.°

I have no wommen suffisaunt certain
The chambres for t’arraye in ordinaunce°
After my lust,° and therfor wolde I fain
That thin were al swich maner governaunce;
Thou knowest eek of old al my plesaunce;
Though thin array° be badde and ivel biseie,°
Do thou thy devoir° at the leeste weye.”°

“Nat only, lord, that I am glad,” quod she,
“To doon your lust, but I desire also
Yow for to serve and plese in my degree
Withouten feinting,° and shal evermo.
Ne never, for no wele° ne no wo,
Ne shal the gost° within min herte stente°
To love yow best with al my trewe entente.”

And with that word she gan the hous to dighte,°
And tables for to sette and beddes make;
And peined hir to doon al that she mighte,
Preying the chambereres,° for Goddes sake,
To hasten hem, and faste swepe and shake;°
And she, the moste servisable° of alle,
Hath every chambre° arrayed and his halle.

Abouten undern° gan this erl alighte,°
That with him broght thise noble children tweie,°
For which the peple ran to seen the sighte
Of hir array, so richely biseie;°
And than at erst° amonges hem they seye,
That Walter was no fool, thogh that him leste
To chaunge his wif, for it was for the beste.

For she is fairer, as they demen° alle,
Than is Grisild, and more tendre of age,
And fairer fruit bitwene hem sholde falle,
And more plesant, for hir heigh linage;
Hir brother eek so fair was of visage,
That hem to seen the peple hath caught plesaunce,
Commending now the markis gouernaunce.

“O stormy° peple! unsad° and ever untrewe!°
Ay undiscreet° and chaunging as a vane,°
Deliting ever in rumbel° that is newe,
For lik the mone ay wexe ye and wane;°
Ay ful of clapping,° dere ynogh a jane;°
Your doom° is fals, your constance ivel° preveth,
A ful greet fool is he that on yow leveth!”°

Thus seiden sadde folk° in that citee,
Whan that the peple gazed up and doun,
For they were glad, right for the noveltee,
To han a newe lady of hir toun.
Namore of this make I now mencioun;
But to Grisilde again wol I me dresse,°
And telle hir constance and hir bisinesse.—

Ful bisy was Grisilde in every thing
That to the feste was apertinent;
Right noght was she abaist° of hir clothing,
Though it were rude° and somdel eek torent.°
But with glad chere to the yate° is went,
With other folk, to gret the markisesse,
And after that doth forth hir bisinesse.

With so glad chere his gestes° she receiveth,
And conningly,° everich in his degree,
That no defaute no man aperceiveth;
But ay they wondren what° she mighte be
That in so povre array was for to see,
And coude swich° honour and reverence;
And worthily they preisen hir prudence.

In al this mene while she ne stente°
This maide and eek hir brother to commende°
With al hir herte, in ful benigne entente,
So wel, that no man coude hir pris° amende.
But atte laste, whan that thise lordes wende
To sitten doun to mete, he° gan to calle
Grisilde, as she was bisy in his halle.

“Grisild,” quod he, as it were in his pley,
“How liketh thee my wif and hir beautee?”
“Right wel,” quod she, “my lord; for, in good fey,°
A fairer say° I never noon than she.
I prey to God yeve° hir prosperitee;°
And so hope I that he wol to yow sende
Plesance ynogh unto your lives ende.

O thing biseke I yow and warne° also,
That ye ne prikke with no tormentinge
This tendre maiden, as ye han don mo;°
For she is fostred in hir norishinge°
More tendrely, and, to my supposinge,
She coude nat adversitee endure
As coude a povre° fostred creature.”

And whan this Walter say° hir pacience,
Hir glade chere and no malice at al,
And he so ofte had doon to hir offence,
And she ay sad and constant as a wal,°
Continuing ever hir innocence overal,
This sturdy markis gan his herte dresse°
To rewen° upon hir wifly stedfastnesse.

“This is ynogh, Grisilde min,” quod he,
“Be now namore agast ne ivel apaied;°
I have thy feith and thy benignitee,
As wel as ever womman was, assaied,
In greet estaat, and povreliche arrayed.
Now knowe I, dere wif, thy stedfastnesse,”
And hir in armes took and gan hir kesse.

And she for wonder took of it no keep;
She herde nat what thing he to hir seide;
She ferde as she had stert out of a sleep,
Til she out of hir masednesse° abreide.°
“Grisild,” quod he, “by God that for us deide,
Thou art my wif, ne noon other I have,
Ne never hadde, as God my soule save!

This is thy doghter which thou hast supposed
To be my wif; that other feithfully
Shal be min heir, as I have ay supposed;°
Thou bare him in thy body trewely.
At Boloigne have I kept hem prively;
Tak hem again, for now maystow nat seye
That thou hast lorn° non of thy children tweie.°

And folk that otherweyes han seid° of me,
I warne hem wel that I have doon this dede
For no malice ne for no crueltee,
But for t’assaie° in thee thy wommanhede,
And nat to sleen my children, God forbede!
But for to kepe hem prively and stille,
Til I thy purpos knewe and al thy wille.”

Whan she this herde, aswowne° doun she falleth
For pitous joye, and after hir swowninge
She bothe hir yonge children unto hir calleth,
And in hir armes, pitously wepinge,
Embraceth hem, and tendrely kissinge
Ful lik a mooder, with hir salte teres
She batheth bothe hir visage and hir heres.

O, which° a pitous thing it was to see
Hir swowning, and hir humble vois to here!
“Grauntmercy, lord, that thanke I yow,” quod she,
“That ye han saved me my children dere!
Now rekke° I never to ben deed° right here;
Sith I stonde in your love and in your grace,
No fors of° deeth, ne whan my spirit pace!°

O tendre, o dere, o yonge children myne,
Your woful mooder wende stedfastly°
That cruel houndes or som foul vermine°
Hadde eten yow; but God, of his mercy,
And your benigne fader tendrely
Hath doon yow kept”; and in that same stounde°
Al sodeinly she swapte° adoun to grounde.

And in her swough so sadly° holdeth she
Hir children two, whan she gan hem t’embrace,
That with greet sleighte° and greet difficultee
The children from hir arm they gonne arace.°
O many a teer on many a pitous face
Doun ran of hem that stoden hir biside;
Unnethe° abouten hir might they abide.

Walter hir gladeth, and hir sorwe slaketh;°
She riseth up, abaised,° from hir traunce,
And every wight° hir joye and feste maketh,
Til she hath caught again hir contenaunce.
Walter hir dooth so feithfully plesaunce,
That it was deintee° for to seen the chere
Bitwixe° hem two, now they ben met yfere.°

Thise ladies, whan that they hir time say,°
Han taken hir, and into chambre goon,
And strepen hir out of hir rude array,
And in a cloth of gold that brighte shoon,
With a coroune of many a riche stoon°
Upon hir heed, they into halle hir broghte,
And ther she was honoured as hir oghte.°

Thus hath this pitous day a blisful ende,
For every man and womman dooth his might
This day in murthe and revel to dispende
Til on the welkne° shoon the sterres light.
For more solempne in every mannes sight
This feste was, and gretter of costage,°
Than was the revel° of hir mariage.

Ful many a yeer in heigh prosperitee
Liven thise two in concord and in reste,
And richely his doghter maried he
Unto a lord, oon of the worthieste
Of al Itaille; and than in pees and reste
His wives fader in his court he kepeth,
Til that the soule out of his body crepeth.

His sone succedeth in his heritage
In reste and pees, after his fader day;°
And fortunat was eek in mariage,
Al putte he nat his wif in greet assay.
This world is nat so strong, it is no nay,
As it hath been in olde times yore,
And herkneth what this auctour° seith therfore.

This storie is seid, nat for that° wives sholde
Folwen Grisilde as in humilitee,
For it were importable,° though they wolde;°
But for that every wight, in his degree,
Sholde be constant in adversitee
As was Grisilde; therfor Petrark writeth
This storie, which with heigh style he enditeth.

For, sith a womman was so pacient
Unto a mortal man, wel more us oghte
Receiven al in gree° that God us sent;
For greet skile is,° he preve° that he wroghte.
But he ne tempteth no man that he boghte,°
As seith Seint Jame, if ye his pistel° rede;
He preveth° folk al day, it is no drede,

And suffreth° us, as for our excercise,°
With sharpe scourges of adversitee
Ful ofte to be bete° in sondry wise;°
Nat for to knowe our wil, for certes he,
Er we were born, knew al our freletee;°
And for our beste is al his governaunce;
Lat us than live in vertuous suffraunce.

But o word, lordinges, herkneth er I go:—
It were ful hard to finde now a dayes
In al a toun Grisildes three or two;
For, if that they were put to swiche assayes,°
The gold of hem hath now so° badde alayes°
With bras, that thogh the coin be fair at eye,
It wolde rather breste° atwo than plie.°

For which heer,° for the Wives love of Bathe,
Whos lif and al hir secte° God maintene
In heigh maistrie,° and elles were it scathe,°
I wol with lusty° herte fresshe and grene
Seyn° yow a song to glade° yow, I wene,°
And lat us stinte° of ernestful° matere:—
Herkneth my song, that seith in this manere.

Grisilde is deed, and eek hir pacience,
And bothe atones buried in Itaille;
For which I crye in open audience,
No wedded man so hardy° be t’assaille°
His wives pacience, in hope to finde,
Grisildes, for in certein he shall faille!

O noble wives, ful of heigh prudence,
Lat noon humilitee your tonge naille,°
Ne lat no clerk have cause or diligence
To write of yow a storie of swich mervaille
As of Grisildis pacient and kinde;
Lest Chichevache yow swelwe° in hir entraille!

Folweth Ekko, that holdeth no silence,
But evere answereth at the countretaille;°
Beth nat bidaffed° for your innocence,
But sharply° tak on yow the governaille.°
Emprinteth wel this lesson in your minde
For commune profit, sith it may availle.°

Ye archewives, stondeth at defence,
Sin° ye be stronge as is a greet camaille;°
Ne suffreth nat that men yow doon offence.
And sclendre° wives, feble as in bataille,
Beth egre° as is a tigre yond in Inde;°
Ay clappeth as a mille,° I yow consaille.

Ne dreed hem nat, do hem no reverence;
For though thin housbonde armed be in maille,°
The arwes of thy crabbed° eloquence
Shal perce° his brest, and eek his aventaille;°
In jalousie I rede° eek thou him binde,
And thou shalt make him couche° as dooth a quaille.°

If thou be fair, ther folk ben in presence
Shew thou thy visage° and thin apparaille;°
If thou be foul,° be free° of thy dispence,°
To gete thee freendes ay do thy travaille;°
Be ay of chere as light as leef on linde,
And lat him care, and wepe, and wringe,° and waille!
