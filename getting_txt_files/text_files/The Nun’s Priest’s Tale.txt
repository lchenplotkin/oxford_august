¶A povre widwe, somdel° stape° in age,

Biside a grove, stonding in a dale.°
This widwe, of which I telle yow my tale,
Sin thilke° day that she was last a wif,
In pacience ladde a ful simple lif,
For litel was hir catel° and hir rente;°
By housbondrie,° of such as God hir sente,
She fond° hirself, and eek hir doghtren two.
Three large sowes° had she, and namo,
Three kin,° and eek a sheep that highte° Malle.
Ful sooty was hir bour,° and eek hire halle,
In which she eet ful many a sclendre° meel.
Of poinaunt° sauce hir neded never a deel.°
No deintee° morsel passed thurgh hir throte;
Hir diete was accordant to° hir cote.°

Attempree° diete was al hir phisik,°
And exercise, and hertes suffisaunce.°
The goute lette hir nothing° for to daunce,
N’apoplexie° shente° nat hir heed;
No win ne drank she, neither whit ne reed;
Hir bord° was served most with whit and blak,
Milk and broun breed, in which she fond no lak,°
Seind° bacoun, and somtime an ei° or tweie,
For she was as it were a maner° deie.°

¶A yerd° she hadde, enclosed al aboute
With stikkes, and a drie dich withoute,
In which she hadde a cok, hight° Chauntecleer,
In al the land of crowing nas° his peer.
His vois was merier than the mery orgon°
On messdayes° that in the chirche gon;°
Wel sikerer° was his crowing in his logge,°
Than is a clokke, or an abbey orlogge.°
By nature crew° he ech ascencioun°
Of the equinoxial° in thilke° toun;
For whan degrees fiftene were ascended,
Than crew he, that it might nat ben amended.°
His comb was redder than the fin° coral,
And batailed,° as it were a castel wal.
His bile° was blak, and as the jeet° it shoon;
Lik asur° were his legges, and his toon;°
His nailes whitter than the lilie flour,
And lik the burned° gold was his colour.
This gentil° cok hadde in his governaunce
Sevene hennes, for to doon al his plesaunce,°
Which were his sustres° and his paramours,°
And wonder° lik° to him, as of° colours.
Of which the faireste hewed° on hir throte
Was cleped° faire damisel° Pertelote.
Curteis° she was, discreet, and debonaire,
And compaignable, and bar° hirself so faire,°
Sin thilke° day that she was seven night old,
That trewely she hath the herte in hold°
Of Chauntecleer loken° in every lith;°
He loved hir so, that wel was him therwith.°
But such a joy was it to here hem singe,
Whan that the brighte sonne gan to springe,°
In swete accord,° “My lief° is faren° in londe.”°
For thilke° time, as I have understonde,

¶And so bifel° that in a daweninge,°
As Chauntecleer among his wives alle
Sat on his perche, that was in the halle,
And next him sat this faire Pertelote,
This Chauntecleer gan gronen° in his throte,
As man that in his dreem is drecched sore.°
And whan that Pertelot thus herde him rore,°
She was agast,° and seide, “O herte dere,
What eileth° yow, to grone in this manere?
Ye been a verray° sleper, fy for shame!”

¶And he answerde and seide thus, “Madame,
I pray yow, that ye take it nat agrief:°
By God, me met° I was in swich meschief°
Right now, that yet min herte is sore afright.°
Now God,” quod he, “my sweven° recche° aright,°

Yet of his look for fere almost I deie;
This caused me my groning, doutelees.”

¶“Avoy!”° quod she, “fy on yow, hertelees!°

Of othere humours coude I telle also,

¶“Oon of the gretteste auctours° that men rede
Seith thus, that whilom° two felawes wente
On pilgrimage, in a ful good entente;
And happed so,° thay come into a toun,
Wheras° ther was swich congregacioun°
Of peple, and eek so streit° of herbergage,°
That they ne founde as muche as o° cotage,
In which they bothe mighte ylogged° be.
Wherfor thay mosten,° of necessitee,
As for that night, departen° compaignie;
And ech of hem goth to his hostelrie,°
And took his logging as it wolde falle.°
That oon of hem° was logged in a stalle,
Fer° in a yerd,° with oxen of the plough;
That other man was logged wel ynough,
As was his aventure,° or his fortune,
That us governeth alle as in commune.°

¶“And so bifel that, longe er° it were day,
This man mette in his bed, theras° he lay,
How that his felaw gan upon him calle,
And seide, ‘Allas! for in an oxes stalle
This night I shal be mordred ther° I lie.
Now help me, dere brother, er I die;
In alle haste com to me,’ he saide.
This man out of his sleep for fere abraide;°
But whan that he was wakned of his sleep,
He turned him, and took of this no keep;°
Him thoughte° his dreem nas but° a vanitee.°
Thus twyës in his sleping dremed he.
And atte° thridde time yet his felawe
Cam,° as him thoughte, and seide, ‘I am now slawe;°
Bihold my blody woundes, depe and wide!
Aris up erly in the morwe tide,°
And at the west gate of the toun,’ quod he,
‘A carte ful of dong ther shaltow° see,
In which my body is hid ful prively;°
Do thilke° carte aresten° boldely.
My gold caused my mordre, sooth° to sayn’;
And tolde him every point° how he was slain,
With a ful pitous face, pale of hewe.
And truste wel his dreem he fond° ful trewe;
For on the morwe, as sone as it was day,
To his felawes in° he took the way;
And whan that he cam to this oxes stalle,
After his felawe he bigan to calle.

¶“The hostiler° answered him anon,
And seide, ‘Sire, your felawe is agon,°
As sone as day he wente out of the toun.’

¶“This man gan fallen in suspecioun,°
Remembring on his dremes that he mette,°
And forth he goth, no lenger wolde he lette,°
Unto the west gate of the toun, and fond
A dong-carte, as it were to donge° lond,
That was arrayed° in the same wise
As ye han herd the dede man devise;°
And with an hardy° herte he gan to crie°
Vengeaunce and justice of this felonie:—
‘My felaw mordred is this same night,

What sholde I more unto this tale sayn?

And in the middel of the dong they founde
The dede man, that mordred was al newe.°

¶“O blisful God, that art so just and trewe!
Lo, how that thou biwreyest° mordre always!

To God, that° is so just and resonable,
That he ne wol nat suffre° it heled° be;
Though it abide° a yeer, or two, or three,
Mordre wol out, this my conclusioun.
And right anoon, ministres of that toun
Han hent° the carter, and so sore him pined,°
And eek the hostiler so sore engined,°
That thay biknewe° hir wikkednesse anoon,
And were anhanged° by the nekke-boon.

¶“Heer may men seen that dremes been to drede.°
And certes, in the same book I rede,
Right in the nexte chapitre after this,

For certein cause, into a fer contree,
If that the wind ne hadde been° contrarie,

¶“But to that oo man° fil° a greet mervaille.
That oon of hem, in sleping as he lay,

Him thoughte a man stood by his beddes side,
And him comaunded, that he sholde abide,°
And seide him thus, ‘If thou tomorwe wende,°
Thou shalt be dreint;° my tale is at an ende.’

¶“He wook,° and tolde his felaw what he mette,°
And preide him° his viage for to lette;°
As for that day, he preide him to abide.°
His felaw, that lay by his beddes side,
Gan for to laughe, and scorned° him ful faste.°
‘No dreem,’ quod he, ‘may so min herte agaste,°

Men dreme of thing that never was ne shal.°
But sith° I see that thou wolt heer abide,
And thus forsleuthen° wilfully thy tide,°

And thus he took his leve, and wente his way.
But er that he had halfe his cours yseiled,°
Noot I nat° why, ne what mischaunce it eiled,°
But casuelly° the shippes botme rente,°
And ship and man under the water wente
In sighte of othere shippes it biside,

¶“And therfor, faire Pertelot so dere,

¶“Lo, in the lif of Seint Kenelm, I rede,

Shortly I seye, as for conclusioun,

¶And with that word he fley° doun fro the beem,
For it was day, and eek his hennes alle;

Thus royal, as a prince is in his halle,

Twenty degrees and oon, and somwhat more;
And knew by kinde,° and by noon other lore,°
That it was prime, and crew with blisful° stevene.
“The sonne,” he saide, “is clomben° up on hevene

Or if his witing streineth° nevere a del°

To walken in the yerd upon that morwe

Wommannes counseil broghte us first to wo,
And made Adam fro paradis to go,

For Phisiologus seith sikerly,°

And so bifel that, as he caste his yë,
Among the wortes,° on a boterflie,
He was war of this fox that lay ful lowe.
Nothing ne liste him° thanne for to crowe,

Now singeth, sire, for° seinte charitee,°

¶This Chauntecleer his winges gan to bete,

So was he ravisshed° with his flaterie.

¶Allas! ye lordes, many a fals flatour°

Than he that soothfastnesse° unto yow seith.
Redeth Ecclesiaste° of° flaterie;
Beth war,° ye lordes, of hir trecherie.

¶This Chauntecleer stood hie upon his toos,
Strecching his nekke, and heeld his eyen° cloos,°
And gan to crowe loude for the nones;°
And daun Russel the fox sterte° up at ones,
And by the gargat° hente° Chauntecleer,
And on his bak toward the wode him beer,°
For yet ne was ther no man that him sewed.°

¶O destinee, that mayst nat been eschewed!°
Allas, that Chauntecleer fleigh° fro the bemes!
Allas, his wif ne roghte nat of° dremes!
And on a Friday fil al this meschaunce.

¶O Venus, that art goddesse of plesaunce,°
Sin that° thy servant was this Chauntecleer,
And in thy service dide al his° poweer,
More for delit,° than world to multiplie,°
Why woldestow° suffre° him on thy day to die?

¶O Gaufred,° dere maister soverain,°
That, whan thy worthy king Richard was slain
With shot,° compleinedest° his deth so sore,
Why nadde I now° thy sentence° and thy lore,°
The Friday for to chide,° as diden ye?
(For on a Friday soothly° slain was he.)
Than wolde I shewe yow how that I coud pleine°
For Chauntecleres drede, and for his peine.°

¶Certes, swich cry ne lamentacioun
Was never of° ladies maad, whan Ilioun°
Was wonne, and Pirrus with his streite swerd,°
Whan he had hent° king Priam by the berd,
And slain him (as saith us Eneydos),°
As maden alle the hennes in the clos,°
Whan they had seyn° of Chauntecleer the sighte.
But sovereinly° dame Pertelote shrighte,°
Ful louder than did Hasdrubales wif,
Whan that hir housbond hadde lost his lif,
And that the Romains hadden brend° Cartage;
She was so ful of torment and of rage,
That wilfully into the fir she sterte,°
And brende° hirselven with a stedfast° herte.

¶O woful° hennes, right so° criden ye,
As, whan that Nero brende° the citee
Of Rome, criden senatoures wives,
For that° hir housbondes losten alle hir° lives;
Withouten gilt this Nero hath hem slain.

¶Now wol I torne to my tale again:—
This sely° widwe, and eek hir doghtres two,
Herden thise hennes crie and maken wo,
And out at dores sterten° they anoon,
And sien° the fox toward the grove goon,°
And bar° upon his bak the cok away;
And criden, “Out! harrow!° and weilaway!°
Ha, ha, the fox!” and after him they ran,
And eek with staves° many another man;
Ran Colle our dogge, and Talbot, and Gerland,°
And Malkin, with a distaf° in hir hand;
Ran cow and calf, and eek the verray° hogges
So were they fered for° berking° of the dogges
And shouting of the men and wimmen eke,
They ronne so,° hem thoughte° hir herte breke.°
They yelleden° as feendes doon in helle;
The dokes° criden as° men wolde hem quelle;°
The gees for fere flowen° over the trees;
Out of the hive cam the swarm of bees;
So hidous was the noise, a! benedicite!°
Certes,° he Jakke Straw, and his meinee,°
Ne made never shoutes half so shrille,
Whan that they wolden any Fleming kille,
As thilke° day was maad upon the fox.
Of bras thay broghten° bemes,° and of box,°
Of horn, of boon,° in which they blewe and pouped,°
And therwithal thay skriked° and they houped;°
It semed as that° heven sholde falle.

¶Now, gode men, I pray yow herkneth alle!
Lo, how Fortune turneth sodeinly
The hope and pride eek of hir enemy!
This cok, that lay upon the foxes bak,
In al his drede, unto the fox he spak,
And seide, “Sire, if that I were as ye,
Yet sholde° I seyn (as wis God helpe° me),
‘Turneth again,° ye proude cherles° alle!
A verray° pestilence° upon yow falle!
Now am I come unto this wodes side,
Maugree your heed,° the cok shal heer abide;°
I wol him ete in feith,° and that anon.’ ”°—

¶The fox answerde, “In feith, it shal be don,”—
And as he spak that word, al sodeinly
This cok brak° from his mouth deliverly,°
And heighe upon a tree he fleigh° anon.
And whan the fox saugh that he was ygon,
“Allas!” quod he, “O Chauntecleer, allas!
I have to yow,” quod he, “ydoon trespas,°
Inasmuche as I maked yow aferd,°
Whan I yow hente,° and broghte out of the yerd;
But, sire, I dide it in no wikke° entente;
Com doun, and I shal telle yow what I mente.
I shal sey sooth° to yow, God help me so.”

¶“Nay than,”° quod he, “I shrewe° us bothe two,
And first I shrew° myself, both blood and bones,°
If thou bigile° me ofter° than ones.
Thou shalt namore, thurgh thy flaterie,
Do me to° singe and winke with min yë.°
For he that winketh, whan he sholde see,
Al wilfully,° God lat° him never thee!”°

¶“Nay,” quod the fox, “but God yeve° him meschaunce,°
That is so undiscreet of° governaunce,°
That jangleth° whan he sholde holde his pees.”°
Lo, swich it is for to be recchelees,°
And necligent, and truste on flaterie.

¶But ye that holden° this tale a folie,°
As of a fox, or of a cok and hen,
Taketh the moralitee, goode men.
For Seint Paul seith, that al that writen is,
To° our doctrine it is ywrite,° ywis.°
Taketh the fruit, and lat the chaf° be stille.
Now, goode God, if that it be° thy wille,
As seith my lord, so make us al good men;
And bringe us to his heighe blisse. Amen.

¶“Sir Nonnes Preest,” our Hoste seide anoon,°
“Yblessed be thy breche,° and every stoon!°
This was a mery tale of Chauntecleer.
But, by my trouthe, if thou were seculer,°
Thou woldest been a tredefoul° aright.
For, if thou have corage as thou hast might,
Thee were nede of° hennes, as I wene,
Ya, mo than seven times seventene.
See, whiche braunes° hath this gentil Preest,
So greet a nekke, and swich a large breest!
He loketh as a sperhauk° with his yën;
Him nedeth nat his colour for to dyen°
With brasil,° ne with grein° of Portingale.°
Now sir, fair falle yow° for youre tale!”
And after that he, with ful mery chere,
Seide unto another, as ye shul here.
