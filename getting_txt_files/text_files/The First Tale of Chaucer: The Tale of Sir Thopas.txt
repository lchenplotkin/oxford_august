Whan seid° was al this miracle, every man
As sobre° was, that wonder was to se,
Til that our Hoste japen° tho bigan,
And thanne at erst° he loked upon me,
And seide thus, “what man artow?”° quod he;
“Thou lokest as thou woldest° finde an hare,
For ever° upon the ground I see thee stare.
Approche neer, and looke up murily.°
Now war yow,° sirs, and lat this man have place;
He in the wast° is shape° as wel as I;
This were a popet° in an arm t’enbrace°
For any womman, smal° and fair of face.
He semeth elvish° by his contenaunce,°
For unto no wight° dooth he daliaunce.°
Sey now somwhat,° sin other folk han said;
Tel us a tale of mirthe, and that anoon”;°—

“Host,” quod I, “ne beth nat ivel apaid,°
For other tale certes can I noon,°
But° of a rim I lerned longe agoon.”
“Ye, that is good,” quod he; “now shul we here
Som deintee° thing, me thinketh by his chere.”°

Listeth,° lords, in good entent,
And I wol telle verraiment°
    Of mirthe and of solas;°
Al of a knight was° fair and gent°
In bataille and in tourneiment,
    His name was Sir Thopas.

Yborn he was in fer° contree,
In Flaundres, al biyond the see,
    At Popering, in the place;°
His fader was a man ful free,°
And lord he was of that contree,
    As it was Goddes grace.

Sir Thopas wax° a doghty° swain,°
Whit was his face as paindemain,°
    His lippes rede as rose;
His rode° is lik scarlet° in grain,°
And I yow telle in good certain,
    He hadde a semly° nose.

His heer, his berd was lik saffroun,°
That to his girdel raughte° adoun;
    His shoon° of cordewane.°
Of Brugges were his hosen° broun,
His robe was of siclatoun,°
    That coste many a jane.°

He coude° hunte at° wilde deer,
And ride an hauking for riveer,°
    With grey goshauk on honde;
Therto° he was a good archeer,
Of° wrastling was ther noon his peer,
    Ther° any ram shal stonde.°

Ful many a maide, bright in bour,°
They moorne° for him, par amour,°
    Whan hem were bet° to slepe;
But he was chast and no lechour,
And sweet as is the brambel-flour°
    That bereth the red hepe.°

And so bifel upon a day,°
For sothe,° as I yow telle may,
    Sir Thopas wolde° out ride;
He worth upon° his stede gray,
And in his hand a launcegay,°
    A long swerd by his side.

He priketh° thurgh a fair forest,
Therinne° is many a wilde best,
    Ye,° both bukke° and hare;
And, as he priketh north and est,
I telle it yow, him hadde almest
    Bitidde° a sory° care.°

Ther springen herbes grete and smale,
The licoris and cetewale,°
    And many a clow-gilofre;°
And notemuge° to putte in ale,
Whether it be moiste° or stale,
    Or for to leye in cofre.°

The briddes singe, it is no nay,°
The sparhauk° and the papejay,°
    That joye it was to heere;
The thrustelcok° made eek his lay,
The wodedouve° upon the spray
    She sang ful loude and clere.

Sir Thopas fil° in luf-longinge
Al whan he herd the thrustel° singe,
    And priked° as he wer wood:°
His faire stede in his prikinge
So swatte° that men mighte him wringe,°
    His sides were al blood.

Sir Thopas eek so wery was
For° prikinge on the softe gras,
    So fiers was his corage,°
That doun he leide him in that plas°
To make° his stede som solas,°
    And yaf him good forage.°

“O Seint Marie, benedicite!°
What eileth this love at me°
    To binde me so sore?°
Me dremed al this night, pardee,
An elf-queen shal my lemman° be,
    And slepe under my gore.°

“An elf-queen wol I love, ywis,°
For in this world no womman is
    Worthy to be my make°
     In toune;
Alle other wommen I forsake,
And to an elf-queene I me take
    By dale and eek by doune!”°

Into his sadel he clamb° anoon,
And priketh over stile and stoon
    An elf-queen for t’espie,°
Til he so longe hath riden and goon
That he fond, in a privee° woon,°
    The contree of Fairie
     So wilde;
For in that contree was ther noon
That to him dorste° ride or goon,
    Neither wif ne childe.

Til that ther cam a greet geaunt,
His name was Sire Olifaunt,
    A perilous man of dede;
He seide, “Child,° by Termagaunt,
But if° thou prike out of min haunt,°
    Anon°I slee thy stede
     With mace.
Heere is the queene of Faierie,
With harpe and pipe and simphonie°
    Dwelling in this place.”

The child seide, “Also mote I thee,°
Tomorwe wol I meete thee
    Whan I have min armoure;
And yet I hope, par ma fay,°
That thou shalt with this launcegay°
    Abyen° it ful soure;°
     Thy mawe°
Shal I percen, if I may,
Er it be fully prime of day,°
    For heer thou shalt be slawe.”°

Sir Thopas drow abak° ful faste;
This geaunt at him stones caste
    Out of a fel° staf-slinge;°
But faire° escapeth Child Thopas,
And al it was thurgh Goddes gras,°
    And thurgh his fair beringe.°

Yet listeth,° lordes, to my tale
Merier than the nightingale,
    For now I wol yow roune°
How Sir Thopas with sides° smale,
Priking over hil and dale,
    Is come again to toune.

His murie men comanded he
To make him° bothe game and glee,°
    For nedes moste he fighte°
With a geaunt with heedes three,
For paramour° and jolitee°
    Of oon that shoon ful brighte.

“Do come,”° he seide, “my minstrales,
And gestours,° for to tellen tales
    Anon in min arminge;
Of romances that been royales,°
Of popes and of cardinales,
    And eek of luf-likinge.”°

They fette° him first the sweete win,
And mede° eek in a maselin,°
    And royal spicerie;
Of gingebreed° that was ful fin,
And licoris, and eek comin,°
    With sugre that is trie.°

He dide° next° his white lere°
Of clooth of lake° fin and clere
    A breech° and eek a sherte;
And next his sherte an aketoun,°
And over that an habergeoun°
    For° percinge of his herte;

And over that a fin hauberk,°
Was al ywroght° of Jewes werk,°
    Ful strong it was of plate;
And over that his cote-armour°
As whit as is a lily flour,
    In which he wol debate.°

His sheeld was al of gold so reed,
And therin° was a bores heed,°
    A charbocle° biside;°
And there he swoor, on ale and breed,
How that the geaunt shal be deed,
    Bitide what bitide!°

His jambeux° were of quirboilly,°
His swerdes shethe of ivory,
    His helm of laton° bright;
His sadel was of rewel-boon,°
His bridel as the sonne shoon,
    Or as the moone light.

His spere was of fin ciprees,°
That bodeth° werre, and nothing° pees,
    The heed ful sharpe ygrounde;
His steede was al dappel° gray,
It gooth an ambel° in the way°
    Ful softely° and rounde°
     In londe.
Lo, lordes min, here is a fit!°
If ye wol° any more of it,
    To telle it wol I fonde.°

Now hold your mouth, par° charitee,
Bothe knight and lady free,°
    And herkneth to my spelle;°
Of batailles and of chivalry,
And of ladies luf-drury°
    Anon I wol yow telle.

Men speke of romances of pris,°
Of Horn child and of Ypotis,
    Of Bevis and Sir Gy,
Of Sir Libeux and Pleindamour;
But Sir Thopas, he bereth the flour°
    Of royal chivalry.°

His goode steede al he bistrood,
And forth upon his wey he glood°
    As sparcle° out of the bronde;°
Upon his crest he bar a tour,
And therin stiked° a lily-flour,
    God shilde° his cors° fro shonde!°

And for he was a knight auntrous,°
He nolde° slepen in non° hous,
    But liggen° in his hoode;°
His brighte helm was his wonger,°
And by him baiteth° his dextrer°
    Of herbes fine and goode.

Himself drank water of the wel,
As did the knight sir Percivel,
    So worly° under wede,°
    Til on a day°——
