¶“Experience, though noon auctoritee°
Were in this world, is right inogh° for me
To speke of wo that is in mariage;
For, lordings, sith° I twelf yeer was of age,
Ythonked be God that is eterne on live,°
Housbonds at chirche-dore I have had five;
For I so ofte have ywedded be;
And al were worthy men in hir degree.°
But me was told certein, nat longe agon is,
That sith that Crist ne went never but onis°
To wedding in the Cane° of Galilee,
That by the same ensample taughte he me
That I ne sholde wedded be but ones.
Herkne eek, lo! which° a sharp° word for the nones°
Beside a welle Jesus, God and man,
Spak in repreve° of the Samaritan:
‘Thou hast yhad five housbonds,’ seide he,
‘And thilke° man, the which that hath now thee,
Is noght thin housbond’; thus seide he certein;
What that he ment therby, I can nat seyn;°
But that I ax,° why that the fifthe man
Was noon housbond to the Samaritan?
How manie° might she have in mariage?
Yet herde I never tellen in min age
Upon this nombre diffinicioun;°
Men may devine° and glosen° up and doun.
But wel I woot° expres,° withoute lie,
God bad us for to wexe° and multiplie;
That gentil° text can I wel understonde.
Eek° wel I woot he seide, min housbonde
Shold lete° fader and moder, and take me;
But of no nombre mencioun made he,
Of bigamie or of octogamie;°
Why sholde men speke of it vileinie?°

¶“Lo, here° the wise king, dan° Salomon;
I trowe° he hadde wives mo than oon;
As, wolde° God, it lefful° were to me
To be refresshed half so ofte as he!
Which yifte of° God hadde he for alle his wivis!
No man hath swich,° that in this world alive is.
God woot,° this noble king, as to my wit,
The firste night had many a mery fit°
With ech of hem, so wel was him on live!°
Yblessed be° God that I have wedded five!
Welcom the sixte, whan that ever he shal.
For sothe,° I wol nat kep me chast in al;
Whan min housbond is fro the world ygon,°
Som Cristen man shal wedde me anon;
For than th’apostle° seith, that I am free
To wedde, a Goddes half,° wher it liketh me.°
He seith that to be wedded is no sinne;
Bet is to be wedded than to brinne.°
What rekketh me,° thogh folk sey vileinie°
Of shrewed° Lameth and his bigamie?
I woot° wel Abraham was an holy man,
And Jacob eek, as ferforth° as I can;°
And ech of hem had wives mo than two;
And many another holy man also.
Whan saugh ye evere, in any maner age,
That heighe God defended° mariage
By expres° word? I pray you, telleth me;
Or wher comanded he virginitee?
I woot as wel as ye, it is no drede,°
Th’Apostel, whan he speketh of maidenhede;°
He seid, that precept therof hadde he noon.
Men may conseille a womman to been oon,°
But conseilling nis° no comandement;
He putte it in our owne jugement.
For hadde God comanded maidenhede,
Thanne hadde he dampned wedding with the dede;
And certes, if ther were no seed ysowe,
Virginitee, wherof than sholde it growe?
Poul dorste° nat comanden atte leste°
A thing of which his maister yaf° noon heste.°
The dart is set up° for virginitee;
Cacch° who so may, who renneth° best lat see.

¶“But this word is nat take of° every wight,
But ther as God list° give it of his might.
I woot° wel, that th’Apostel was a maide;°
But natheless, thogh that° he wroot and saide,
He wold° that every wight° were swich° as he,
Al nis but° conseil to virginitee;
And for to been a wif, he yaf me leve°
Of indulgence; so nis it no repreve°
To wedde me, if that my make° die,
Withoute excepcioun of° bigamie.
Al were° it good no womman for to touche,
He mente as in his bed or in his couche;
For peril is° both fir and tow° t’assemble;
Ye know what this ensample may resemble.°
This al and som, he heeld virginitee
Mor parfit° than wedding in freletee.°
Freeltee clepe I, but if° that he and she
Wold leden al hir lif in chastitee.
I graunte it wel, I have noon envie,°
Thogh maidenhed preferre° bigamie;
Hem liketh° to be clene,° body and goost,°
Of min estaat° I nil nat make no boost.
For wel ye knowe, a lord in his houshold,
He hath nat every vessel al of gold;
Som been of tree,° and doon hir lord servise.
God clepeth° folk to him in sondry° wise,
And everich hath of God a propre yifte,°
Som this, som that,—as him it liketh shifte.°

¶“Virginitee is greet perfeccioun,
And continence° eek with devocioun.
But Crist, that of perfeccioun is welle,°
Bad° nat every wight he shold go selle
All that he hadde, and give it to the pore,
And in swich wise° folwe him and his fore.°
He spak to hem that wold live parfitly;°
And lordinges, by your leve,° that am nat I.
I wol bistow the flour° of al min age°
In th’actes and in fruit of mariage.

¶“Tell me also, to what conclusioun
Were membres° maad of generacioun,°
And for what profit was a wight ywroght?°
Trusteth right wel, they wer nat maad for noght.
Glose° whoso wole,° and sey bothe up and doun,
That they were maked for purgacioun
Of urine, and our bothe thinges smal°
Were eek° to knowe a femele from a male,
And for noone other cause: sey ye no?
Th’experience woot° wel it is noght so;
So that the clerkes° be nat with me wrothe,
I sey this, that they maked been for bothe,
That is to sey, for office,° and for ese°
Of engendrure,° ther° we nat God displese.
Why sholde men els in hir bokes sette,°
That man shal yelde° to his wif hir dette?°
Now wherwith° sholde he make his payement,
If he ne used his sely° instrument?
Than were they maad upon a creature,
To purge urine, and eek for engendrure.

¶“But I sey noght that every wight° is holde,°
That hath swich harneis° as I to yow tolde,
To goon and usen hem in engendrure;
Than shold men take of chastitee no cure.°
Crist was a maide,° and shapen as a man,
And many a seint, sith that the world bigan,
Yet lived they evere in parfit° chastitee.
I nil nat envie° no virginitee;
Lat hem be breed° of pured° whete-seed,°
And lat us wives hoten° barly-breed;°
And yet with barly-breed, Mark telle can,
Our Lord, Jesu, refresshed many a man.
In swich° estaat as God hath cleped° us
I wol persevere, I nam nat precius.°
In wifhode I wol use min instrument
As frely° as my maker hath it sent.
If I be daungerous,° God yeve me sorwe!
Min housbond shal it han bothe eve and morwe,
Whan that him list° com forth and paye his dette.
An housbonde I wol have, I nil nat lette,°
Which shal be both my dettour° and my thral,°
And have his tribulacioun withal
Upon his flessh, whil that I am his wif.
I have the power duringe al my lif
Upon his propre° body, and noght° he.
Right thus th’Apostel tolde it unto me;
And bad° our housbonds for to love us weel.
Al this sentence° me liketh every-deel”—

¶Up stert the Pardoner, and that anon,°
“Now dame,” quod he, “by God and by Seint John,
Ye been a noble prechour in this cas!
I was about to wedde a wif; allas!
What° sholde I bye° it on my flesh so dere?°
Yet hadde I lever° wed no wif toyere!”°

¶“Abid!”° quod she, “my tale is nat bigonne;
Nay, thou shalt drinken of another tonne°
Er that I go, shal savour° wors than ale.
And whan that I have told thee forth my tale
Of tribulacioun in mariage,
Of which I am expert in al min age,
This to seyn, myself have been the whippe;—
Than maystow chese whether thou wolt sippe
Of thilke tonne° that I shal abroche.°
Be war of it, er thou to neigh° approche;
For I shal telle ensamples mo than ten.
‘Whoso that nil be war° by other men,
By him shul other men corrected be.’
The same wordes writeth Ptholomee;
Rede in his Almageste, and take it there.”

¶“Dame, I wold pray yow, if your wil it were,”
Seid this Pardoner, “as ye bigan,
Tell forth your tale, spareth° for no man,
And teche us yonge men of your praktike.”°

¶“Gladly,” quod she, “sith° it may yow like.°
But yet I pray to al this compaignie,
If that I speke after my fantasie,°
As taketh not agrief° of that° I seye;
For min entente° nis but° for to pleye.

¶“Now sires, now wol I tel forth my tale.—
As ever mote° I drinken win or ale,
I shal sey sooth, tho housbonds that I hadde,
As three of hem were goode and two were badde.
The three men were goode, and riche, and olde;
Unnethe° mighte they the statut° holde
In which that they wer bounden unto me.
Ye woot° wel what I mene of this, pardee!°
As help me God, I laughe whan I thinke
How pitously anight I made hem swinke;°
And by my fey,° I tolde° of it no stoor.°
They had me yeven° hir land and hir tresoor;°
Me neded nat do lenger diligence°
To winne hir love, or doon° hem reverence.°
They loved me so wel, by God above,
That I ne told no deintee° of hir love!
A wis womman wol sette hir ever in oon°
To gete hir love, ther as° she hath noon.
But sith° I hadde hem hoolly° in min hond,
And sith they had me yeven° all hir lond,
What° sholde I taken hede° hem for to plese,
But it were° for my profit and min ese?°
I sette hem so awerke, by my fey,°
That many a night they songen ‘Weilawey!’°
The bacoun was nat fet° for hem, I trowe,°
That som men han in Essexe at Dunmowe.
I governed hem so wel, after my lawe,
That ech of hem ful blisful was and fawe°
To bring me gaye thinges fro the faire.
They were ful glad whan I spak to hem faire;°
For God it woot,° I chidde° hem spitously.°

¶“Now herkneth, how I bar me proprely,°
Ye wise wives, that can understonde.
Thus shul ye speke and bere hem wrong on honde;°
For half so boldely can ther no man
Swere° and lyen as a womman can.
I sey nat this by wives that ben wise,
But if° it be whan they hem misavise.°
A wise wif, if that she can hir good,°
Shal beren him on hond° the cow° is wood,°
And take witnesse of hir owne maide
Of hir assent;° but herkneth how I saide.

¶“ ‘Sir olde kainard,° is this thin array?
Why is my neighebores wif so gay?°
She is honoured overal ther° she goth;
I sitte at hoom, I have no thrifty° cloth.
What dostow° at my neighebores hous?
Is she so fair? artow so amorous?
What rown° ye with our maide? benedicite!°
Sir olde lechour, lat thy japes° be!
And if I have a gossib° or a freend,
Withouten gilt, thou chidest as a feend,°
If that I walke or pleye unto his hous!
Thou comest hoom as dronken as a mous,
And prechest on thy bench, with ivel preef!°

¶“ ‘Thou seyst to me, it is a greet meschief°
To wedde a povre womman, for costage;°
And if that she be riche, of heigh parage,°
Than seystow that it is a tormentrie
To suffre hir pride and hir malencolie.°
And if that she be fair, thou verray knave,°
Thou seyst that every holour° wol hir have;
She may no while in chastitee abide,
That is assailled upon ech a side.

¶“ ‘Thou seyst, som folk desire us for richesse,
Som for our shap, and som for our fairnesse;
And som for she can outher° singe or daunce,
And som for gentillesse and daliaunce;°
Som for hir handes and hir armes smale;°

Thou seyst, men may nat kepe° a castel wal;

What eileth° swich an old man for to chide?
Thow seyst, we wives wol our vices hide

Wel may that be a proverbe of a shrewe!°

¶“ ‘Thou seyst, that oxen, asses, hors, and houndes,

But folk of wives maken noon assay°

And than, seystow, we wol our vices shewe.
Thou seyst also, that it displeseth me
But if° that thou wolt preise my beautee,

¶“ ‘Of alle men yblessed moot° he be,

By this proverbe thou shalt understonde,

And sey thise wordes in the apostles name,

Thou liknest it also to wilde fir;

Thou seyst, that right as wormes shende° a tree,

¶“Lordings, right thus, as ye han understonde,
Bar I stif° min housebondes on honde,°
That thus they seiden in hir dronkenesse;
And al was fals, but that I took witnesse
On Janekin and on my nece also.
O Lord, the pine° I dide hem and the wo,
Ful giltelees, by Goddes swete pine!°
For as an hors I coude bite and whine.°
I coude pleine,° and° I was in the gilt,
Or elles° often time hadde I ben spilt.°
Whoso that first to mille comth, first grint;°

Of thing of which they never agilte° hir live.

¶“Of wenches wolde I beren him on honde,°

Yet tikled it his herte, for that he
Wend° that I hadde of him so greet chiertee.°

Under that colour° hadde I many a mirthe.
For al swich° wit is yive us in our birthe;
Deceite, weping, spinning God hath yive°

And thus of o thing I avaunte me,°
At ende I had the bet° in ech degree,°
By sleighte,° or force, or by som maner thing,
As by continuel murmur or grucching;°
Namely° a° bedde hadden they meschaunce,
Ther wolde I chide and do hem no plesaunce;
I wold no lenger in the bed abide,

Than wolde I suffre him do his nicetee.°
And therfore every man this tale I telle,
Win whoso may, for al is for to selle.
With empty hand men may noon haukes lure;°
For winning° wolde I al his lust endure,

And yet in bacon° hadde I never delit;
That made me that ever I wolde hem chide.

For by my trouthe, I quitte° hem word for word.
As help me verray God omnipotent,
Thogh° I right now shold make my testament,
I ne owe hem nat a word that it nis quit.
I broghte it so aboute by my wit,
That they most yeve it up,° as for the beste;
Or elles had we never been in reste.
For thogh he looked as a wood leoun,°
Yet sholde he faille of his conclusioun.

¶“Than wolde I seye, ‘Goode lief,° taak keep°
How mekly looketh Wilkin oure sheep;
Com neer, my spouse, lat me ba° thy cheke!

But I wol kepe it for your owne tooth.°
Ye be to blame, by God, I sey yow sooth.’°
Swich maner wordes hadde we on honde.
Now wol I speken of my fourth housbonde.

¶“My fourthe housbond was a revelour,
This is to seyn, he hadde a paramour;°
And I was yong and ful of ragerie,°
Stibourne° and strong, and joly° as a pie.°
Wel coude I daunce to an harpe smale,
And singe, ywis, as any nightingale,
Whan I had dronke a draughte of sweete win.
Metellius, the foule cherl,° the swin,°
That with a staf birafte° his wif hir lif,
For she drank win, thogh° I had been his wif,
Ne sholde nat han daunted me fro° drinke;
And, after win, on Venus moste I thinke:
For al so siker° as cold° engendreth hail,
A likerous° mouth moste han a likerous° tail.
In° womman vinolent° is no defence,°
This knowen lechours by experience.

¶“But, Lord Crist! whan that it remembreth me
Upon my yowthe, and on my jolitee,
It tikleth° me about min herte rote.°
Unto this day it dooth min herte bote°
That I have had my world as in my time.
But age, allas! that al wole envenime,°
Hath me biraft° my beautee and my pith;°
Lat go, farwel, the devel go therwith!
The flour is goon, ther is namore to telle,
The bren,° as I best can, now moste I selle;
But yet to be right mirie wol I fonde.°
Now wol I tellen of my fourth housbonde.

¶“I seye, I hadde in herte greet despit°
That he of any other had delit.
But he was quit,° by God and by Seint Joce!
I made him of the same wode a croce;°
Nat of my body in no foul manere,
But certeinly, I made folk swich chere,°
That in his owne grece° I made him frie
For angre, and for verray jalousie.
By God, in erthe I was his purgatorie,
For which I hope° his soule be in glorie.
For God it woot,° he sat ful ofte and song
Whan that his shoo° ful bitterly him wrong.°
Ther was no wight,° save God and he, that wiste,°
In many wise, how sore° I him twiste.°
He deid whan I cam fro Jerusalem,
And lith ygrave° under the rode-beem,°
Al° is his tombe noght so curious°
As was the sepulcre of him, Darius,
Which that Appelles wroghte subtilly;
It nis but° wast° to burie him preciously.°
Lat him far wel, God yeve his soule reste,
He is now in the grave and in his cheste.°

¶“Now of my fifthe housbond wol I telle.
God lete° his soule never come in helle!
And yet was he to me the moste shrewe;°
That feele I on my ribbes al by rewe,°
And ever shal, unto min ending-day.
But in our bed he was so fresh and gay,
And therwithal so wel coude he me glose,°
Whan that he wolde han my bele chose,°
That thogh° he had me bet° on every boon,°
He coude winne again my love anoon.
I trowe° I loved him beste, for that° he
Was of his love daungerous° to me.
We wommen han, if that I shal nat lie,
In this matere a queinte° fantasie;
Wait° what thing we may nat lightly have,
Therafter wol we crie al day and crave.
Forbede us thing, and that desiren we;
Prees on us faste,° and thanne wol we flee.
With daunger° oute we al our chaffare;°
Greet prees° at market maketh dere ware,°
And to greet cheep° is holde° at litel pris;°
This knoweth every womman that is wis.

¶“My fifthe housbond, God his soule blesse!
Which that I took for love and no richesse,
He somtime° was a clerk of Oxenford,
And had left scole, and wente at hoom to bord°
With my gossib,° dwellinge in our toun,
God have hir soule! hir name was Alisoun.
She knew min herte and eek my privetee°
Bet than our parish preest, so moot I thee!°
To hir biwreyed° I my conseil° al.
For had min housbond pissed on a wal,
Or doon a thing that sholde han cost his lif,
To hir, and to another worthy wif,°
And to my nece, which that I loved wel,
I wolde han told his conseil every del.
And so I did ful often, God it woot,°
That made his face ful often reed and hoot
For verray shame, and blamed himself for he
Had told to me so greet a privetee.

¶“And so bifel that ones, in a Lente,
(So often times I to my gossib wente,
For ever yet I loved to be gay,°
And for to walke, in March, Averille, and May,
Fro hous to hous, to here sondry talis),°
That Jankin clerk, and my gossib, dame Alis,
And I myself, into the feldes wente.
Min housbond was at London al that Lente;
I had the bettre leiser for to pleye,
And for to see, and eek for to be seye°
Of lusty° folk; what wiste° I wher my grace°
Was shapen° for to be, or in what place?
Therfore I maad my visitaciouns,
To vigilies° and to processiouns,
To preching° eek and to thise pilgrimages,
To pleys of miracles° and mariages,
And wered upon my gaye scarlet gites.°
Thise wormes, ne thise motthes, ne thise mites,
Upon my peril, frete° hem never a deel;°
And wostow° why? for they were used weel.°

¶“Now wol I tellen forth what happed me.
I sey, that in the feeldes walked we,
Til trewely we had swich daliance,°
This clerk and I, that of my purveiance°
I spak to him, and seide him, how that he,
If I were widwe, sholde wedde me.
For certeinly, I sey for no bobance,°
Yet was I never withouten purveiance
Of mariage, n’of° other thinges eek.
I holde a mouses hert° nat worth a leek,
That hath but oon hole for to sterte° to,
And if that faille, thanne is al ydo.°

¶“I bar him on honde° he hadde enchanted me;
My dame° taughte me that soutiltee.°
And eek° I seide, I mette° of him al night;
He wolde han slain me as I lay upright,°
And al my bed was ful of verray blood,
But yet I hope that ye shal do me good;
For blood bitokeneth gold, as me was taught.
And al was fals, I dremed of it right naught,
But as I folwed ay my dames lore,
As wel of this as other thinges more.

¶“But now sir, lat me see, what I shal seyn?
A! ha! by God, I have my tale° agein.

¶“Whan that my fourthe housbond was on bere,°
I weep algate,° and made sory chere,°
As wives moten,° for it is usage,°
And with my coverchief° covered my visage;
But for that° I was purveied of a make,°
I wept but smal, and that I undertake.°
To chirche was min housbond born° amorwe°
With neighebors, that for him maden sorwe;°
And Jankin oure clerk was oon of tho.°
As help me God, whan that I saugh him go
After the beer,° me thoughte he hadde a paire
Of legges and of feet so clene° and faire,
That al min herte I yaf unto his hold.°
He was, I trowe,° a twenty winter old,
And I was fourty, if I shal sey sooth;
But yet I hadde alwey a coltes tooth.°
Gat-tothed° I was, and that bicam° me weel;
I had the prente° of Seinte Venus seel.°
As help me God, I was a lusty oon,
And faire and riche, and yong, and wel bigoon;°
And trewly, as min housbonds tolde me,
I had the beste quoniam° might be.
For certes, I am al Venerien
In felinge, and min herte is Marcien.
Venus me yaf° my lust, my likerousnesse,°
And Mars yaf me my sturdy hardinesse.°
Min ascendent° was Taur,° and Mars therinne.
Allas! allas! that ever love was sinne!
I folwed ay min inclinacioun
By vertu° of my constellacioun;
That made me I coude noght withdrawe
My chambre of Venus from a good felawe.
Yet have I Martes mark° upon my face,
And also in another privee place.
For, God so wis° be my savacioun,
I loved never by no discrecioun,°
But ever folewed min appetit,
Al were° he short or long, or blak or whit;
I took no kep,° so that he liked me,°
How pore he was, ne eek of what degree.°

¶“What sholde I seye, but, at the monthes ende,
This joly clerk Jankin, that was so hende,°
Hath wedded me with greet solempnitee,
And to him yaf° I al the lond and fee°
That ever was me yeven° therbifore;
But afterward repented me ful sore.
He nolde suffre nothing of my list.°
By God, he smoot° me ones on the list,°
For that° I rente° out of his book a leef,°
That of the strook° min ere wex° al deef.
Stiborn° I was as is a leonesse,
And of my tonge a verray jangleresse,°
And walke I wolde, as I had doon biforn,
From hous to hous, although he had it sworn.°
For which he often times wolde preche,
And me of olde Roman gestes° teche,
How he, Simplicius Gallus, lefte his wif,
And hir forsook for terme of al his lif,
Noght but for open-heeded° he hir say°
Lokinge out at his dore upon a day.

¶“Another Romain tolde he me by name,
That, for° his wif was at a somers game
Withoute his witing,° he forsook° hir eke.
And than wolde he upon his Bible seke
That ilke° proverbe of Ecclesiaste,
Where he comandeth and forbedeth faste,°
Man shal nat suffre his wif go roule° aboute;
Than wolde he sey right thus, withouten doute,
‘Whoso that buildeth his hous al of salwes,°
And priketh° his blind hors over the falwes,°
And suffreth his wife to go seken halwes,°
Is worthy to been hanged on the galwes!’°
But al for noght, I sette noght an hawe°
Of his proverbes n’of his olde sawe,°
Ne I wold nat of him corrected be.
I hate him that my vices telleth me,
And so do mo,° God woot!° of us than I.
This made him with me wood al outrely;°
I nolde noght forbere° him in no cas.

¶“Now wol I sey yow sooth, by Seint Thomas,
Why that I rente° out of his book a leef,
For which he smoot me so that I was deef.

¶“He hadde a book that gladly, night and day,
For his desport° he wolde rede alway.
He cleped° it Valerie and Theofraste,
At whiche book he lough° alwey ful faste.°
And eek° ther was somtime a clerk at Rome,
A cardinal, that highte° Seint Jerome,
That made a book again Jovinian;
In whiche book eek ther was Tertulan,°
Crisippus, Trotula, and Helowis,°
That was abbesse nat fer fro Paris;
And eek the Parables of Salomon,
Ovides Art,° and bookes many on,
And alle thise wer bounde in o volume.°
And every night and day was his custume,
Whan he had leiser° and vacacioun
From other worldly occupacioun,
To reden on this book of wikked wives.
He knew of hem mo legendes and lives
Than been of goode wives in the Bible.
For trusteth wel, it is an impossible
That any clerk° wol speke good of wives,
But if° it be of holy seintes lives,
Ne of noon other womman never the mo.
Who peinted the leon,° tel me who?
By God, if wommen hadde writen stories,
As clerkes han withinne hir oratories,°
They wolde han write of men more wikkednesse
Than all the mark of Adam° may redresse.
The children of Mercurie and Venus
Been in hir wirking° ful contrarious;
Mercurie loveth wisdom and science,°
And Venus loveth riot and dispence.°
And, for° hir divers° disposicioun,
Ech falleth° in others exaltacioun;°
And thus, God woot!° Mercurie is desolat°
In Pisces, wher Venus is exaltat;°
And Venus falleth ther Mercurie is reised;
Therfor no womman of no clerk is preised.
The clerk, whan he is old, and may noght do
Of Venus werkes worth his olde sho,°
Than sit he doun, and writ in his dotage
That wommen can nat kepe hir mariage!°

¶“But now to purpos, why I tolde thee
That I was beten° for a book, pardee.
Upon a night Jankin, that was our sire,°
Redde on his book, as he sat by the fire,
Of Eva first, that, for° hir wikkednesse,
Was al mankinde broght to wrecchednesse,
For which that Jesu Crist himself was slain,
That boghte us with his herte blood again.
Lo, here expres° of womman may ye finde,
That womman was the los of al mankinde.

¶“Tho redde he me how Sampson loste his heres,°
Slepinge, his lemman° kitte hem with hir sheres;°
Thurgh whiche tresoun loste he bothe his eyen.°

¶“Tho° redde he me, if that I shal nat lyen,
Of Hercules and of his Dianire,
That caused him to sette himself afire.

¶“Nothing forgat° he the penaunce° and wo
That Socrates had with his wives two;
How Xantippa cast pisse upon his heed;
This sely° man sat stille as he were deed;
He wiped his heed, namore dorste° he seyn
But ‘Er that thonder° stinte,° comth a rein.’
Of Phasipha, that was the quene of Crete,
For shrewednesse,° him thought the tale swete;
Fy! spek namore—it is a grisly thing—
Of hir horrible lust and hir liking.°
Of Clitermistra, for hir lecherie,
That falsly made hir housbond for to die,
He redde it with ful good devocioun.°

¶“He told me eek for what occasioun
Amphiorax at Thebes loste his lif;
Min housbonde hadde a legende of his wif,
Eriphilem, that for an ouche° of gold
Hath prively unto the Grekes told
Wher that hir housbonde hidde him in a place,
For which he hadde at Thebes sory grace.°

¶“Of Livia tolde he me, and of Lucie,
They bothe made hir housbonds for to die;
That oon for love, that other was for hate;
Livia hir housbonde, on an even late,
Empoisoned hath, for that she was his fo.
Lucia, likerous, loved hir housbond so,
That, for° he sholde alwey upon hir thinke,
She yaf° him swich a maner love-drinke,
That he was deed, er it wer by° the morwe;
And thus algates° housbonds hadden sorwe.

¶“Than tolde he me, how oon Latumius
Compleined to his felawe Arrius,
That in his gardin growed swich a tree,
On which, he seid, how that his wives three
Hanged hemself for° herte despitous.°
‘O leve brother,’ quod this Arrius,
‘Yif me a plante of thilke blissed tree,
And in my gardin planted shal it be!’

¶“Of latter date, of wives hath he red,
That somme han slain hir housbonds in hir bed,
And lete hir lechour dighte° hir al the night
Whan that the corps lay in the floor upright.°
And somme han drive nailes in hir brain
Whil that they slepte, and thus they han hem slain.
Somme han hem yeven° poisoun in hir drinke.
He spak mor harm than herte may bithinke.
And therwithal, he knew of mo proverbes
Than in this world ther growen gras or herbes.
‘Bet is,’ quod he, ‘thin habitacioun
Be with a leoun or a foul dragoun,
Than with a womman using° for to chide.
Bet is,’ quod he, ‘hie° in the roof abide
Than with an angry wif doun in the hous;
They been so wikked and contrarious;
They haten that° hir housbonds loveth ay.’°
He seide, ‘a womman cast hir shame away,
Whan she cast of° hir smok’;° and forther mo,
‘A fair womman, but she be chaast also,
Is lik a gold ring in a sowes nose.’
Who wolde wenen,° or who wold suppose°
The wo that in min herte was, and pine?°

¶“And whan I saugh he wolde never fine°
To reden on this cursed book al night,
Al sodeinly three leves° have I plight°
Out of his book, right as° he radde, and eke,
I with my fist so took him° on the cheke,
That in our fir° he fil bakward adoun.
And he upstirte as dooth a wood° leoun,
And with his fest° he smoot me on the heed,
That in the floor I lay as I wer deed.
And when he saugh how stille that I lay,
He was agast,° and wolde han fled his way,
Til atte laste out of my swogh° I breide:°
‘O! hastow slain me, false theef?’° I seide,
‘And for my land thus hastow mordred me?
Er° I be deed, yet wol I kisse thee.’

¶“And neer he cam, and kneled faire adoun,
And seide, ‘deere suster Alisoun,
As help me God, I shal thee never smite;°
That I have doon, it is thyself to wite.°
Foryeve it me, and that I thee biseke’°—
And yet eftsones° I hitte him on the cheke,
And seide, ‘Theef,° thus muchel am I wreke;°
Now wol I die, I may no lenger speke.’
But atte laste, with muchel° care and wo,
We fille acorded,° by us selven two.
He yaf° me al the bridel° in min hond
To han the governance of hous and lond,
And of his tonge and of his hond also,
And made him brenne° his book anon right tho.°
And whan that I had geten unto me,
By maistrie,° al the soverainetee,°
And that he seid, ‘Min owne trewe° wif,
Do as thee lust° the terme of al thy lif,
Keep thin honour, and keepe eek min estaat’°—
After that day we had never debaat.
God help me so, I was to him as kinde
As any wif from Denmark unto Inde,
And also trewe,° and so was he to me.
I prey to God that sit in magestee,
So blesse his soule, for his mercy dere!
Now wol I sey my tale, if ye wol here.”

¶ The Frere lough,° whan he had herd al this,
“Now, dame,” quod he, “so have I joye or blis,
This is a long preamble of a tale!”
And whan the Somnour herd the Frere gale,°
“Lo!” quod the Somnour, “Goddes armes two!
A frer wol entremette him° ever mo.
Lo, goode men, a flie° and eek a frere
Wol falle in every dish and eek matere.°
What spekestow of preambulacioun?°
What! amble,° or trotte, or pees,° or go sit doun;
Thou lettest° our disport° in this manere.”

¶“Ye, woltow so,° sir Somnour?” quod the Frere,
“Now, by my feith, I shal, er that I go,
Telle of a Somnour swich° a tale or two,
That al the folk shal laughen in this place.”

¶“Now elles,° Frere, I wol bischrew thy face,”°
Quod this Somnour, “and I bishrewe me,°
But if° I telle tales two or thre
Of freres er I com to Sidingborne,
That I shal make thin herte for to morne;°
For wel I woot° thy patience is goon.”

¶Our Hoste cride “Pees! and that anoon!”°
And seide, “Lat the womman telle hir tale.
Ye fare° as folk that dronken ben of ale.
Do, dame, tel forth your tale, and that is best.”

¶“Al redy, sir,” quod she, “right as yow lest,°
If I have licence of this worthy Frere.”
“Yis, dame,” quod he, “tel forth, and I wol here.”

¶In th’olde dayes of the king Arthour,
Of which that Britons speken greet honour,
All was this land fulfild of faierie.°
The elf-queen, with hir joly° compaignie,
Daunced ful ofte in many a grene mede;°
This was the olde opinion, as I rede,°
I speke of manie hundred yeres ago;
But now can no man see none elves mo.
For now the grete charitee and prayeres
Of limitours° and othere holy freres,
That serchen° every lond and every streem,
As thikke as motes° in the sonne-beem,
Blessinge halls, chambres, kichens, boures,°
Citees, burghes,° castels, hye toures,
Thropes, bernes, shipnes, dayeries,°
This° maketh° that ther been no fayeries.
For ther° as wont to walken was° an elf,
Ther walketh now the limitour himself
In undermeles° and in morweninges,
And seith his matins° and his holy thinges
As he goth in his limitacioun.
Wommen may go now saufly up and doun,
In every bush, or under every tree;
Ther is noon other incubus° but he,
And he ne wol doon hem but dishonour.

¶And so bifel it, that this king Arthour
Hadde in his hous a lusty° bacheler,°
That on a day cam ridinge fro river;°
And happed° that, allone as she was born,
He saugh a maide° walkinge him biforn,
Of whiche maide anon,° maugree hir heed,°
By verray° force he rafte hir° maidenheed;°
For which oppressioun° was swich clamour
And swich pursute° unto the king Arthour,
That dampned° was this knight for to be deed
By cours of lawe, and sholde han lost his heed
Paraventure,° swich was the statut° tho;°
But that the quene and other ladies mo
So longe preyeden the king of grace,
Til he his lif° him graunted in the place,
And yaf° him to the quene al at hir wille,
To chees,° whether she wolde him save or spille.°

¶The quene thanketh the king with al hir might,
And after this thus spak she to the knight,
Whan that she saw hir time, upon a day:
“Thou standest yet,” quod she, “in swich array,°
That of thy lif yet hastow no suertee.°
I grant thee lif, if thou canst tellen me,
What thing is it that wommen most desiren.
Be war,° and keep thy nekke-boon from iren.°
And if thou canst nat tellen it anon,°
Yet wol I yeve thee leve° for to gon
A twelf-month and a day, to seche and lere°
An answer suffisant in this matere.
And suertee° wol I han, er that thou pace,
Thy body for to yelden° in this place.”

¶Wo was this knight and sorwfully he siketh;°
But what! he may nat do al as him liketh.°
And at the laste, he chees° him for to wende,°
And come again, right at the yeres ende,
With swich answere as God wolde him purveye;°
And taketh his leve, and wendeth forth his weye.

¶He seketh every hous and every place,
Whereas he hopeth for to finde grace,
To lerne, what thing wommen loven most;
But he ne coude arriven in no cost,°
Wheras he mighte finde in this matere
Two creatures accordinge infere.°
Som seide, wommen loven best richesse,
Som seide, honour, som seide, jolinesse;
Som, riche array,° som seiden, lust abedde,
And ofte time to be widwe° and wedde.
Somme seide, that our hertes been most esed,
Whan that we been yflatered° and yplesed.
He gooth ful ny° the sothe,° I wol nat lie;
A man shal winne us best with flaterie;
And with attendance,° and with bisinesse,
Been we ylimed,° bothe more and lesse.°

¶And somme seyn, how that we loven best
For to be free, and do right as us lest,°
And that no man repreve° us of our vice,°
But sey that we be wise, and nothing nice.°
For trewely, ther is noon of us alle,
If any wight° wol clawe us on the galle,°
That we nil kike,° for he seith us sooth;
Assay, and he shal finde it that so dooth.
For be we never so vicious withinne,
We wol° been holden° wise, and clene of sinne.°

¶And somme seyn, that greet delit han we
For to ben holden stable and eek secree,°
And in o purpos stedfastly to dwelle,
And nat biwreye° thing that men us telle.
But that tale is nat worth a rake-stele;°
Pardee, we wommen conne° nothing hele;°
Witnesse on Mida; wol ye heer the tale?

¶Ovide, amonges other thinges° smale,°
Seid, Mida hadde, under his longe heres,°
Growinge upon his heed two asses eres,
The whiche vice° he hidde, as he best mighte,
Ful subtilly° from every mannes sighte,
That, save° his wif, ther wiste° of it namo.°
He loved hir most, and trusted hir also;
He preyed hir,° that to no creature
She sholde tellen of his disfigure.

¶She swoor him nay, for al this world to winne,
She nolde do that vileinie or sinne,
To make hir housbonde han so foul a name;
She wold nat° telle it for hir owne shame.
But nathelees, hir thoughte° that she dide,°
That she so longe sholde a conseil° hide;
Hir thoughte it swal° so sore aboute hir herte,
That nedely° som word hir moste asterte;°
And sith° she dorste° telle it to no man,
Doun to a maris° faste by° she ran;
Til she cam there, hir herte was afire,
And, as a bitor° bombleth° in the mire,
She leide hir mouth unto the water doun:
“Biwreie° me nat, thou water, with thy soun,”
Quod she, “to thee I telle it, and namo;
Min housbonde hath long asses eres two!
Now is min herte all hool, now is it oute;
I might no lenger kepe it, out of doute,”°
Heer may ye se, thogh we a time abide,°
Yet out it moot,° we can no conseil° hide;
The remenant of the tale if ye wol heere,
Redeth Ovide, and ther ye may it lere.°

¶This knight, of which my tale is specially,
Whan that he saugh he might nat com therby,
This is to sey, what wommen loven moost,
Withinne his brest ful sorweful was the goost;°
But hoom he gooth, he mighte nat soyourne.°
The day was com that hoomward moste he tourne,°
And in his wey it happed him° to ride,
In al this care,° under a forest-side,°
Wheras he saugh upon a daunce go
Of ladies foure and twenty, and yet mo;°
Toward the whiche daunce he drow° ful yerne,°
In hope that som wisdom sholde he lerne.
But certeinly, er° he cam fully there,°
Vanisshed was this daunce, he niste° where.
No creature saugh he that bar lif,°
Save on the grene he saugh sittinge a wif;
A fouler wight° ther may no man devise.°
Again° the knight this olde wif gan rise,
And seid, “Sir knight, heerforth° ne lith° no wey.
Tel me what that ye seken, by your fey.°
Paraventure it may the bettre be;
Thise olde folk can muchel thing,”° quod she.

¶“My leve mooder,”° quod this knight certein,
“I nam but deed,° but if° that I can seyn
What thing it is that wommen most desire;
Coud ye me wisse,° I wold wel quit your hire.”°

¶“Plight° me thy trouth,° heer in min hand,” quod she,
“The nexte thing that I requere thee,
Thou shalt it do, if it lie in thy might;
And I wol telle it yow er it be night.”

¶“Have heer my trouthe,” quod the knight, “I grante.”
“Than,” quod she, “I dar me wel avante,°
Thy lif is sauf, for I wol stonde therby,
Upon my lif, the queen wol seye as I.°
Lat see which is the proudeste of hem alle,
That wereth on° a coverchief or calle,°
That dar sey nay, of that I shal thee teche;
Lat us go forth withouten lenger speche.”
Tho rouned° she a pistel° in his ere,
And bad him to be glad, and have no fere.

¶Whan they be comen to the court, this knight
Seide, he had holde his day, as he had hight,°
And redy was his answere, as he saide.
Ful many a noble wif, and many a maide,°
And many a widwe,° for that they ben wise,
The queene hirself sittinge as a justise,°
Assembled been, his answere for to here;
And afterward this knight was bode° appere.

¶To every wight° comanded was silence,
And that the knight shold telle in audience,°
What thing that worldly wommen loven best.
This knight ne stood nat stille as doth a best,°
But to his questioun anon° answerde
With manly vois, that al the court it herde:

¶“My lige lady, generally,”° quod he,
“Wommen desiren to have sovereintee°
As wel over hir housbond as hir love,°
And for to been in maistrie° him above;
This is your most desir, thogh ye me kille.
Doth as yow list,° I am here at your wille.”
In al the court ne was ther wif ne maide,
Ne widwe, that contraried° that he saide,
But seiden he was worthy han his lif.

¶And with that word up stirt° the olde wif,
Which that the knight saugh sittinge in the grene:
“Mercy,” quod she, “my soverein lady quene!
Er that your court departe, do me right.°
I taughte this answere unto the knight;
For which he plighte me his trouthe° there,
The firste thing I wolde of him requere,
He wolde it do, if it lay in his might.
Bifor the court than preye I thee, sir knight,”
Quod she, “that thou me take unto thy wif;
For wel thou wost° that I have kept° thy lif.
If I sey fals, sey nay, upon thy fey!”

¶This knight answerde, “Allas! and weilawey!
I woot right wel that swich was my biheste.°
For Goddes love, as chees° a new requeste;
Tak al my good,° and lat my body go.”

¶“Nay than,” quod she, “I shrewe° us bothe two!
For thogh that I be foul, and olde, and pore,
I nold° for al the metal,° ne for ore,
That under erthe is grave, or lith above,
But if thy wif I were, and eek thy love.”

¶“My love?” quod he; “Nay, my dampnacioun!
Allas! that any of my nacioun°
Sholde ever so foul disparaged° be!”
But al for noght, th&apos;ende is this, that he
Constreined was, he nedes moste hir wedde;
And taketh his olde wif, and gooth to bedde.

¶Now wolden som men sey, paraventure,
That, for my necligence, I do no cure°
To tellen yow the joye and al th’array°
That at the feste° was that ilke day.
To whiche thing shortly answere I shal:
I sey, ther nas no joy ne feste at al,
Ther nas but hevinesse and much sorwe;
For prively° he wedded hir on morwe,°
And al day after hidde him as an oule;°
So wo was him, his wif looked so foule.

¶Greet was the wo the knight hadde in his thoght,
Whan he was with his wif abedde ybroght;
He walweth,° and he turneth to and fro.
His olde wif lay smilinge evermo,
And seide, “O dere housbond, benedicite!
Fareth every knight thus with his wif as ye?
Is this the lawe of king Arthures hous?
Is every knight of his so dangerous?°
I am your owne love and eek° your wif;
I am she, which that saved hath your lif;
And certes, yet did I yow never unright;°
Why fare ye thus with me this firste night?
Ye faren lik a man had lost his wit;
What is my gilt? for Goddes love, tel it,
And it shal been amended, if I may.”

¶“Amended?” quod this knight, “Allas! nay, nay!
It wol nat been amended never mo!
Thou art so loothly,° and so old also,
And therto comen of so lowe a kinde,°
That litel wonder is, thogh I walwe and winde.°
So wolde God min herte wolde breste!”°

¶“Is this,” quod she, “the cause of your unreste?”
“Ye, certainly,” quod he, “no wonder is.”

¶“Now, sir,” quod she, “I coude amende al this,
If that me liste,° er it were dayes three,
So° wel ye mighte bere yow unto me.

¶“But for ye speken of swich gentillesse°
As is descended out of old richesse,
That therfore sholden ye be gentil° men,
Swich arrogance is nat worth an hen.
Lok who that is most vertuous alway,
Privee and apert,° and most entendeth ay°
To do the gentil dedes that he can,
And tak him for the grettest gentil man.
Crist wol° we claime of° him our gentillesse,
Nat of oure eldres for hir old richesse.
For thogh they yeve° us al hir heritage,
For which we claim to been of heigh parage,°
Yet may they nat biquethe, for nothing,°
To noon of us hir vertuous living,
That made hem gentil men ycalled be;
And bad° us folwen hem in swich degree.°

¶“Wel can the wise poete of Florence,
That highte° Dant, speken in this sentence;°
Lo in swich maner rim° is Dantes tale:
‘Ful selde up riseth by his branches smale°
Prowesse° of man, for God, of his goodnesse,
Wol that of him° we claime our gentillesse’;
For of our eldres may we nothing claime
But temporel° thing, that man may hurte° and maime.°

¶“ ‘Eek every wight° wot° this as wel as I,
If gentiless wer planted naturelly
Unto a certein linage, doun the line,

To doon of gentiles the faire office;°
They mighte do no vileinie or vice.

¶“ ‘Taak fir,° and ber it in the derkest hous
Bitwix this° and the mount of Kaucasous,°
And lat men shet the dores and go thenne;°
Yet wol the fir as faire lie° and brenne,°
As twenty thousand men mighte it biholde;
His office naturel° ay wol it holde,
Up peril of my lif, til that it die.

¶“ ‘Heer may ye see wel, how that genterie°
Is nat annexed to possessioun,
Sith folk ne doon hir operacioun°
Alwey, as dooth the fir, lo! in his kinde.°
For, God it woot,° men may wel often finde
A lordes son do shame and vileinie;
And he that wol han pris of° his gentrie
For he was boren of a gentil hous,°
And hadde hise eldres noble and vertuous,
And nil° himselven do no gentil dedis,
Ne folwe his gentil auncestre that deed° is,
He nis nat gentil, be he duk or erl;
For vileins sinful dedes make a cherl.°
For gentillesse nis but renomee°
Of thine auncestres, for hir heigh bountee,°
Which is a strange thing to° thy persone.
Thy gentillesse comth fro God allone;
Than comth our verray° gentillesse of grace,
It was nothing biquethe° us with our place.°

¶“ ‘Thenketh how noble, as seith Valerius,
Was thilke Tullius Hostilius,
That out of povert roos to heigh noblesse.
Redeth Senek,° and redeth eek Boëce,
Ther shul ye seen expres° that it no drede is,°
That he is gentil that doth gentil dedis;
And therfor, leve° housbond, I thus conclude,
Al were° it that mine auncestres were rude,°
Yet may the hye God, and so hope I,
Grant me grace to liven vertuously.
Thanne am I gentil, whan that I biginne
To liven vertuously and weive° sinne.

¶“ ‘And theras ye of povert me repreve,°
The hye God, on whom that we bileve,
In wilful° povert chees° to live his lif.
And certes every man, maiden, or wif,
May understond that Jesus, heven king,
Ne wolde nat chese a vicious° living.
Glad poverte is an honest thing, certein;
This wol Senek and other clerkes seyn.
Whoso that halt him° paid° of his poverte,
I holde° him riche, al° hadde he nat a sherte.
He that coveiteth is a poure wight,
For he wolde han that° is nat in his might.
But he that noght hath, ne coveiteth have,
Is riche, although ye holde him but a knave.°

¶“ ‘Verray povert,° it singeth proprely;°
Juvenal seith of povert merily:
“The poure man, whan he goth by the weye,
Bifor the theves he may singe and pleye.”
Poverte is hateful good, and, as I gesse,
A ful greet bringer out° of bisinesse;°
A greet amender eek of sapience°
To him that taketh it in pacience.
Povert is this, although it seme elenge:°
Possessioun,° that no wight wol chalenge.°
Povert ful ofte, whan a man is lowe,
Maketh his God and eek himself to knowe.
Povert a spectacle° is, as thinketh me,
Thurgh which he may his verray° frendes see.
And therfor, sir, sin° that I noght yow greve,°
Of my povert namore ye me repreve.°

¶“Now, sire, of elde° ye repreve me;
And certes, sir, thogh noon auctoritee°
Were in no book, ye gentils of honour
Seyn that men sholde an old wight° doon favour,°
And clepe° him fader, for° your gentillesse;
And auctours shal I finden, as I gesse.

¶“Now ther° ye sey, that I am foul and old,
Than drede you noght to been a cokewold;°
For filthe and elde, also moot I thee,°
Been grete wardeins upon° chastitee.

¶“But nathelees, sin I know your delit,
I shal fulfill your worldly° appetit.
Chees now,” quod she, “oon of thise thinges tweie,
To han me foul and old til that I deie,
And be to yow a trewe° humble wif,
And never yow displese in al my lif,
Or elles ye wol han me yong and fair,
And tak your aventure° of the repair°
That shal be to your hous, bicause of me,
Or in som other place, may wel be.
Now chees yourselven, wheither° that yow liketh.”

¶This knight aviseth° him and sore siketh,°
But atte laste he seide in this manere,
“My lady and my love, and wif so dere,
I put me in your wise governance;
Cheseth yourself, which may be most plesance,
And most honour to yow and me also.
I do no fors° the wheither° of the two;
For as yow liketh, it suffiseth me.”

¶“Thanne have I gete of yow maistrie,” quod she,
“Sin I may chese, and governe as me lest?”°
“Ye, certes, wif,” quod he, “I holde° it best.”

¶“Kis me,” quod she, “we be no lenger wrothe;°
For, by my trouthe, I wol be to yow bothe,
This is to seyn, ye, bothe fair and good.
I prey to God that I mot sterven wood,°
But° I to yow be also good and trewe
As ever was wif, sin that the world was newe.
And, but° I be tomorn as fair to sene
As any lady, emperice, or quene,
That is bitwix° the est and eke the west,
Doth with my lif and deeth right as yow lest.°
Cast up the curtin,° look how that it is.”

¶And whan the knight saugh verraily al this,
That she so fair was, and so yong therto,°
For joye he hente° hire in his armes two,
His herte bathed in a bath of blisse;
A thousand time arewe° he gan hir kisse.
And she obeyed him in every thing
That mighte doon him plesance or liking.

¶And thus they live, unto hir lives ende,
In parfit° joye; and Jhesu Crist us sende
Housbondes meke, yonge, and fresshe abedde,
And grace t’overbide° hem that we wedde.
And eek I praye Jhesu shorte hir lives
That wol not be governed by hir wives;
And olde and angry nigards° of dispence,
God sende hem soone verray pestilence.
