Madame, ye ben of alle beaute shrine°
As fer as cercled is° the mapamonde;°
For as the cristal glorious ye shine,
And like ruby ben° your chekis° rounde.
Therwith° ye ben so mery and joconde,°
That at a revel° whan I see you dance,
It is an oinement° unto my wounde,
Thogh ye to° me ne do no daliaunce.°
 
For thogh I wepe of teres ful a tine,°
Yet may that wo min herte nat confounde°
Your seemly° vois that ye so smal° out twine°
Makith my thoght in joye and blis habounde.°
So curteisly I go, with° love bounde,°
That to myself I sey, in my penaunce,°
Suffiseth me° to love you, Rosemounde,
Thogh ye to me ne do no daliaunce.
 
Nas never° pik° walwed° in galauntine.°
As I in love am walwed and iwounde;°
For which° ful ofte° I of myself divine°
That I am trewe° Tristam the secounde
My love may not refreid° be nor afounde;°
I brenne° ay° in an amorous plesaunce.
Do what you list,° I wil your thral° be founde,
Thogh ye to me ne do no daliaunce.
