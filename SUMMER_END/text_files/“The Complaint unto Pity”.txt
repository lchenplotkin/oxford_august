Pite, that I have sought so yore ago,°
With herte sore, and ful of besy° peine,
That in this world was never wight° so wo°
Withoute dethe; and, if I shal not° feine,
My purpos was, to Pite to compleine
Upon the crueltee and tirannie
Of Love, that for my trouthe° doth° me die.
 
And when that I, by lengthe of certein yeres,°
Had evere in oon° a time sought to speke,
To Pite ran I, al bespreint° with teres,
To prayen hir on Crueltee me awreke.°
But, er° I might with any worde outbreke,
Or tellen any of my peines smerte,°
I fonde hir deed, and buried in an herte.
 
Adoune I fel, when that I saugh the herse,
Dede as a stoon, whil that the swogh° me laste;
But up I roos, with colour ful diverse,
And pitously on hir min eyen° caste,
And ner° the corps I gan to presen° faste,
And for the soule I shoop me for° to preye;
I was but lorn;° ther was no more to seye.
 
Thus am I slain, sith that° Pite is deed;
Allas that day that ever hit shuld falle!°
What maner man dar now holde up his heed?
To whom shal eny sorwful herte calle?
Now Crueltee hath cast° to sleen° us alle
In° idel hope, folk redelesse of° peine—
Sith she is ded—to whom shul we compleine?
 
But yet encreseth me this wonder newe,
That no wight° woot° that she is ded, but I;
So many men as in hir time hir knewe,
And yet she dyed not so sodeinly;
For I have sought hir ever ful bisily
Sith first I hadde wit or mannes minde;°
But she was dede, er that I coude hir finde.
 
Aboute hir herse stoden lustily,°
Withouten° any wo, as thoughte me,°
Bountee° parfit,° wel armed and richely,
And fresshe Beautee, Lust,° and Jolitee,°
Assured Maner, Youthe, and Honestee,
Wisdome, Estaat,° and Dreed,° and Governaunce,°
Confedred° both by bonde and alliaunce.
 
A compleint hadde I, writen, in min honde,
For to have put° to Pite as a bille,°
But when I al this companie° ther fonde,
That° rather° wolden al my cause spille°
Than do me help, I held my pleinte° stille;°
For to that folk, withouten any faile,
Without Pite ther may no bille availe.
Then leve° I al thees virtues,° sauf Pite,
 
Keping° the corps, as ye have herd me seyn,
Confedred al by bonde of Crueltee,
And ben assented° when I shal be slein.°
And I have put my compleint up° agein;
For to my foos my bille I dar not shewe,
Th’effect of which seith thus, in wordes fewe:—

“Humblest of hert, highest of reverence,
Benigne flour,° coroune of vertues alle,
Sheweth° unto your rial° excellence
Your servaunt, if I durste° me so calle,
His mortal° harm,° in which he is yfalle,
And noght al only for his evel fare,°
But for your renoun, as he shal declare.
“Hit stondeth thus: your contraire, Crueltee,
Allyed is ayenst° your regalie°
Under colour° of womanly Beautee,
For° men ne shuld not knowe hir tirannie,°
With Bountee, Gentilesse, and Curtesie,
And hath deprived you of youre place
That hight° ‘Beautee, apertenant° to Grace.’
 
“For kindly,° by youre heritage right,°
Ye been annexed ever unto Bountee;
And verrely° ye oughte do your might
To helpe Trouthe in his adversitee.
Ye been also the coroune of Beautee;
And certes, if ye wanten° in thise tweine,°
The worlde is lore;° ther is no more to seyne.
 
“Eek what availeth Maner° and Gentilesse
Withoute you, benigne creature?
Shal Crueltee be your governeresse?
Allas! what herte may hit longe endure?
Wherfor,° but° ye the rather° take cure°
To breke that perilouse alliaunce,
Ye sleen hem° that ben in your obeisaunce.°
 
“And further over,° if ye suffre° this,
Your renoun° is fordo° than in a throwe;°
Ther shal no man wit° well what Pite is.
Allas! that your renoun shuld be so lowe!
Ye be than fro youre heritage ythrowe
By Crueltee, that occupieth your place;
And we despeired, that seken° to your grace.
“Have mercy on me, thou Herenus° quene,
That° you have sought° so tenderly and yore;°
Let som streem° of your light on me be sene
That love and dreed you, ay lenger the more.°
For, sothly for to seyne, I bere the sore,°
And, though I be not cunning° for to pleine,°
For Goddes love, have mercy on my peine!
 
“My peine is this, that what so I desire
That have I not, ne no thing lik therto;
And ever set° Desire min herte on fire;
Eek on that other side, wherso° I go,
What maner thing that° may encrese wo
That have I redy, unsoghte, every where.
Me lakketh but° my deth, and than° my bere.°
 
“What nedeth to shewe parcel° of my peine?
Sith every wo that herte may bethinke°
I suffre, and yet I dar not to you pleine;
For wel I wote,° though I wake or winke,°
Ye rekke° not whether I flete° or sinke.
But natheles, my trouthe° I shal sustene
Unto my deth, and that shal wel be sene.
 
“This is to seyne, I wol be youres ever;
Though ye me slee by Crueltee, your fo,
Algate° my spirit shal never dissever
Fro your servise, for any peine or wo.
Sith ye be deed—allas! that hit is so!—
Thus for your deth I may wel wepe and pleine
With herte sore and ful of besy peine.”
