¶Whan that the Knight had thus his tale ytold,
In al the route° nas° ther yong ne old
That he ne seide it was a noble storie,
And worthy for to drawen to memorie;°
And namely° the gentils° everichon.°
Our Hoste lough° and swoor, “So moot I gon,
This gooth aright; unbokeled is the male;°
Lat see now who shal telle another tale:
For trewely, the game is wel bigonne.
Now telleth ye, sir Monk, if that ye conne,°
Somwhat, to quite° with the Knightes tale.”

¶The Miller, that fordronken° was al pale,
So that unnethe° upon his hors he sat,
He nolde avalen° neither hood ne hat,
Ne abide° no man for his curteisie,
But in Pilates vois he gan to crie,
And swoor by armes and by blood and bones,
“I can° a noble tale for the nones,°
With which I wol now quit° the Knightes tale.”
Our Hoste saugh that he was dronke of ale,
And seide: “Abid, Robin, my leve° brother,
Som bettre man° shal telle us first another:
Abide, and lat us werken thriftily.”°

¶“By goddes soul,” quod he, “that wol nat I;
For I wol speke, or elles go my wey.”
Our Host answerde: “Tel on, a devel wey!°
Thou art a fool, thy wit is overcome.”

¶“Now herkneth,” quod the Millere, “alle and some!
But first I make a protestacioun
That I am dronke, I knowe it by my soun;°
And therfore, if that I misspeke or seye,
Wite it° the ale of Southwerk, I yow preye;
For I wol telle a legende° and a lif
Bothe of a carpenter, and of his wif,
How that a clerk hath set the wrightes cappe.”°

¶The Reve answerde and seide, “Stint thy clappe,°
Lat be thy lewed° dronken harlotrie.°
It is a sinne and eek a greet folie
To apeiren° any man, or him diffame,°
And eek to bringen wives in swich fame.
Thou mayst ynogh° of othere thinges seyn.”

¶This dronken Miller spak ful sone agein,°
And seide, “Leve° brother Osewold,
Who° hath no wif, he is no cokewold.
But I sey nat therfor that thou art oon;
Ther been ful gode wives many oon,
And evere a thousand goode ayeins oon badde,
That knowestow wel thyself, but if thou madde.°
Why artow° angry with my tale now?
I have a wif, pardee,° as well as thou,
Yet nolde I,° for the oxen in my plogh,
Take upon me more than ynogh,°
As demen° of myself that I were oon;°
I wol beleve wel that I am noon.
An housbond shal nat been inquisitive
Of Goddes privetee,° nor of his wif.
So he may finde° Goddes foison° there,
Of the remenant° nedeth nat enquere.”

¶What sholde I more seyn, but this Millere
He nolde his wordes for no man forbere,°
But tolde his cherles° tale in his manere;
M’athinketh° that I shal reherce° it here.
And therfore every gentil wight° I preye,
Demeth noght,° for Goddes love, that° I seye
Of evel entente, but that I moot° reherce
Hir tales alle, be they bet° or werse,
Or elles falsen° som of my matere.
And therfor, whoso list it nat yhere,°
Turne over the leef,° and chese° another tale;
For he shal finde ynowe,° grete and smale,
Of storial thing° that toucheth gentillesse,°
And eek moralitee and holinesse;
Blameth nat me if that ye chese amis.
The Millere is a cherl, ye know wel this;
So was the Reve, and other many mo,
And harlotrie° they tolden bothe two.
Aviseth yow° and put me out of blame;
And eek men shal nat make ernest of game.°
