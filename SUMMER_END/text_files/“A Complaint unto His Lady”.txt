The longe night, whane every creature
Shoulde have their rest in somwhat,° as by kinde,°
Or elles° may their lif nat long endure,
Hit falleth° most into my woful minde
Howe I so far have brought myself behinde,°
That, sauf the° deeth, ther may no thing me lisse,°
So desespaired I am from° alle blisse.
 
This same thought me lasteth° til the morow,°
And from the morow forth til hit be eve;
Ther nedeth me° no care° for to borow,
For bothe I have good leiser° and good leve;°
Ther is no wight that wil me wo° bereve°
To weepe enough, and wailen° al my fille;
The sore° sparke of peine doth me spille.°

This Love that hath me sette in suche° a place
That my desir he never wol fulfille;
For neither pitee, mercy, neither grace°
Can I nat° finde; and fro my sorwful herte,
For to be dede,° I can hit nought arace.°
The more I love, the more she doth me smerte;°
Thurgh which I see, withoute remedie,
That from the deeth I may no wise° asterte;°

Now sothly,° what she hight° I wol reherse;
Hir name is Bounte,° sette° in wommanhede,°
Sadnesse° in youthe, and Beawte prideleese,°
And Plesaunce,° under governaunce° and drede;°
Hir surname eek° is Faire Reutheleese,°
The Wise, iknit° unto° Good Aventure,°
That, for° I love hir, sleeth° me giltelees.°
 
Hir love I best, and shal, while° I may dure,°
Bet° than myself an hundred thousand deele,°
Than al this worldes richesse° or creature.°
Nowe hath not Love me bestowed weele°
To love, ther° I never shal have part?°
Alas! right thus° is turned me the wheele,°
Thus am I slain with loves fury° dart.
I can but love hir best, my sweete fo;
Love hath me taught no more of his art
But serve° alwey, and stinte° for no wo.°

Within my trewe careful° hert ther is
So moche wo, and eek° so litel blisse,
That wo is me that ever I was bore;°
For al that thing° which I desire I misse,°
And al that ever I wolde not,° iwisse,°
That finde I redy° to me evermore;
And of° al this I not° to whom me pleine.°
For she that mighte° me out of this bringe
Ne recchith nought° whether I weepe or singe;
So litel reuthe° hath she upon my peine.
 
Alas! whan sleping time is, thanne I wake,
Whan I shuld daunce, for fere° than I quake;
This hevy° lif I lede° for your sake,
Thaugh ye therof° in no wise° heede take,°
Min hertes lady, and hool my lives° quene!
For truwly durst° I seye, as that° I feele,
Me semeth° that your sweete hert of steele
Is whetted° nowe ageines me to keene.°
 
My deere hert, and best beloved fo,
Why likith yow° to do° me al this wo,
What have I doon that greveth° yow, or saide,
But for° I serve and love yow and no mo?
And whilst I live, I wol° do ever so;
And therfor, sweet,° ne beoth nat evil apaied.°
For so goode and so fair as that° ye be,°
Hit were a right° gret wonder but° ye hadde
Of alle servants, bothe of goode and badde;
And leest° worthy of alle hem,° I am he.
 
But nevertheles, my righte° lady sweete,
Thaugh that I beo° unconning° and unmeete°
To serve as I koud° best ay° your highnesse.
Yit is ther fainer° noon, that wolde I heete,°
Than I, to do yow ese,° or ellis beete°
Whatso° I wist° that were to yow distresse.
And hadde I might° as goode° as I have wille,
Than should ye feel where it wer so° or noon;
For in this worlde living is ther noon
That fainer° wold your hertes wil fulfille.
 
For bothe I love and eek° dreed° yow so sore°
And algates° mote,° and have don yow, ful yore,°
That better loved is noon,° ne° never shal;
And yit I wold beseech° yow of° no° more
But leveth° wele,° and be nat wroth° therfore,
And let me serve yow forth;° lo! this is al.
For I am nought so hardy° ne so woode°
For to desire that ye should love me;
For wele° I wot, allas! that may nat be;
I am so litel worthy, and ye so goode.
 
For ye be oon the° worthiest on live,°
And I the mooste unlikly for to thrive°;
Yit, for al this, now witeth° ye right wele,
That ye ne shul° me from your service drive
That I nil° ay,° with al my wittes five,
Serve yow truwly,° what° wo so that° I fele.
For I am sette° on yowe in such manere
That, thaugh ye never wil upon me rewe,°
I must yow love, and beon° ever as trewe
As any can or may on live° here.
 
The more that I love yow, goodly,° free,°
The lasse° finde I that ye loven me;
Alas! whan shal that harde° witte° amende?°
Where is now al your wommanly pitee,
Your gentilesse° and your debonairtee,°
Wil ye no thing therof° upon me spende?°
And so hool,° swete,° as I am youres al,
And so° gret wille as I have yow to serve,
Now, certes,° and° ye lete° me thus sterve,°
Yit have ye wonne° theron but a smal.°
 
For, at my knowing,° I do nothing why,°
And this I wol beseech° yow hertely,°
That, ther° ever ye finde, whil ye live,
A truwer servant to yow thane am I,
Leveth° me thanne, and sleeth° me hardely,°
And I my deeth to you wil al forgive.
And if ye find no trewer verraily,°
Why will ye suffre° than that I thus spille,°
And for no maner° gilt but my good wille?
As good wer° thanne° untrewe as truw to be.
 
But I, my lif and deth, to yow obey,
And with right buxum° hert holy° I prey,
As is your most° plesure, so doth by° me;
Wel lever° is me liken yow° and die
Than for to any thing or° think or sey
That mighte yow offende in° any time.
And therfor, sweet,° rewe° on my peines smerte,°
And of° your grace° grauntith me som drope;°
For elles° may me last ne blis ne° hope,
Ne° dwell within my trouble° careful° herte.
