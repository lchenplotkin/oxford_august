¶Many men sayn that in sweveninges°
Ther nis but fables° and lesinges;°
But men may some sweven seen
Which hardely° ne false been,
But afterward ben apparaunt.°
This may I drawe to waraunt°
An authour, that hight° Macrobes,°
That halt° not dremes fals ne lees,°
But undothe° us the avisioun
That whilom° met° king Cipioun.°
 
¶And whoso saith, or weneth° it be
A jape,° or els a nicetee°
To ween° that dremes after fal,°
Let whoso liste° a fool me cal.
For this trowe° I, and say for me,°
That dremes signifiaunce be
Of good and harm to many wightes,°
That dremen in her slepe anightes°
Ful many thinges covertly,°
That fallen after al openly.°
 
¶Within my twenty yere of age,
Whan that Love taketh his corage°
Of yonge folk, I wente soone
To bedde, as I was wont° to done,
And faste° I slepte; and in sleping,
Me mette° suche a swevening,°
That likede me° wonders° wele;
But in that sweven is never a dele°
That it nis° afterward befal,
Right as this dreem wol telle us al.
 
¶Now this dreem wol I rime° aright,
To mak your hertes gaye and light;
For Love it prayeth, and also
Commaundeth me that it be so
And if there any aske me,
Whether that it be he or she,
Howe this book whiche is here
Shal hatte°, that I rede° you here;
It is the Romance of the Rose,
In which the art of love I close.°
 
¶The mater faire° is of to make;
God graunt in gree° that she it take
For whom that it begonnen is!
And that is she that hath, ywis,
So mochel pris;° and therto she
So worthy is biloved to be,
That she wel ought of pris° and right,°
Be cleped° Rose of every wight.°
That it was May me thoughte tho,°
It is five yere or more ago.
 
¶That it was May, thus dremed me,
In time of love and jolite,
That al thing ginneth waxen gay,°
For ther is neither busk° nor hay°
In May, that it nil shrouded° bene,°
And it with newe leves wrene.°
These wodes eek recoveren grene,
That drie° in winter ben to sene;
The erthe wexeth proud withall,
For swote dews that on it fall,
And al the pore estat forgette
In which that winter had it sette,
And than bicometh° the ground so proude
That it wol have a newe shroude,°
And maketh so queint° his robe and faire
That it hath hewes° an hundred pair
Of gras and floures, inde° and pers,°
And many hewes ful divers:
That is the robe I mene, ywis,°
Through which the ground to preisen is.
 
¶The birdes, that han lefte hir song,
Whil thei han suffred cold so strong
In wedres gril,° and derk to sight,
Ben in May, for the sonne bright,
So glade, that they shewe in singing,
That in hir hertes is swich liking,
That they mot° singen and be light.
Than doth the nightingale hir might
To maken noise, and singen blithe.°
Than is blisful, many sithe,°
The chelaundre° and the papingay.°
Than yonge folk entenden° ay
For to ben gay° and amorous,
The time is than so saverous.°
Hard is the hert that loveth nought
In May, whan al this mirth is wrought;
Whan he may on these braunches here
The smale briddes singen clere
Her blisful swete song pitous;°
And in this sesoun delitous,
Whan love affraieth° alle thing,
Me thought anight, in my sleping,
Right in my bed, ful redily,
That it was by the morowe erly,
And up I roos, and gan me clothe;
Anoon I wissh° min hondes bothe;
A silvur nedle forth I drogh
Out of an aguler° queint ynoghe,°
And gan this nedle threde anon;°
For out of toun me list° to gon
The sowne° of briddes for to here,
That on thise buskes° singen clere.
And in the sweet sesoun that lefe is,
With a thred basting° my slevis,
Alone I wente in my playing,
The smale foules song harkning;
That peined hem ful many a peire
To singe on bowes blosmed feire.
Joly and gay, ful of gladnesse,
Toward a river I gan me dresse,°
That I herd renne faste by;
For fairer playing non saugh I
Than playen me° by that rivere,
For from an hille that stood ther nere,°
Cam doun the streem ful stif and bold.°
Cleer was the water, and as cold
As any welle is, soth to seyn;
And somdel° lasse it was than Sein,°
But it was straighter wel away.°
And never saugh I, er that day,
The water that so liked me;
And wonder glad was I to see
That lusty° place, and that rivere;
With that water that ran so clere
My face I wissh. Tho saugh I wel
The botme paved everydell°
With gravel, ful of stones° shene.°
The medewe softe, swote,° and grene,
Beet° right on the water side.
Ful cleer was than the morowtide,°
And ful attempre,° out of drede.°
Tho gan I walke through the mede,°
Dounward ay in my pleying,
The river side costeying°
 
¶And whan I had a while goon,
I saugh a Gardin right anoon,
Ful long and brood,° and everydell°
Enclosed was, and walled wel,
With hye walles enbatailled,°
Portraied without, and wel entailled°
With many riche° portraitures;
And bothe images and peintures
Gan I biholde bisily.°
And I wol tel you, redily,
Of thilke images the semblaunce,
As fer as I have remembraunce.
 
¶Amidde saugh I Hate stonde,°
That for hir wrathe,° ire, and onde,°
Semed to been a minoresse,°
An angry wight,° a chideresse;°
And ful of gile,° and fel corage,°
By semblaunt was that ilke° image.
And she was nothing wel arraied,°
But lik a wood° womman afraied;°
Yfrounced° foul was hir visage,
And grenning° for dispitous rage;°
Hir nose snorted° up for tene.°
Ful hidous was she for to sene,
Ful foule and rusty° was she, this.
Hir heed ywrithen° was, ywis,°
Ful grimly with a greet towaile.°
 
¶An image of another entaile,
A lift half,° was hir faste by;°
Hir name above hir heed saugh I,
And she was called Felony.
 
¶Another image, that Vilany
Ycleped° was, saugh I and fonde
Upon the wal on hir right honde.
Vilanie was lik somdell°
That other image; and, trusteth wel,
She semede a wikked creature.
By countenaunce, in portraiture,
She semed be ful dispitous,
And eek ful proud and outrageous.°
Wel coude he peinte, I undertake,°
That suche an image coude make.
Ful foule and cherlish° semed she,
And eek° villeinous for to be,
And litel coude° of noriture,°
To worshipe° any creature.
 
¶And next was peinted Coveitise,°
That eggeth° folk, in many gise,°
To take and yeve° right nought ageine,
And grete tresours up to leine.°
And that is she that for usure°
Leneth° to many a creature
The lasse° for the more winning,°
So covetous is her brenning.°
And that is she, for pennies fele,°
That techeth for to robbe and stele
These theves, and these smal harlotes;°
And that is routh,° for by hir throtes
Ful many oon hangith at the laste.
She makith folk compasse° and caste°
To taken other folkis thing,°
Through robberie, or miscounting.
And that is she that makith trechoures;°
And she that maketh fals pledoures,°
That with hir termes° and hir domes°
Doon° maidens, children, and eek gromes°
Hir heritage to forgo.°
Ful croked were hir hondes two;
For Coveitise is ever wode°
To gripen other folkis goode.
Coveitise, for hir winning,
Ful leef° hath other mennes thing.
 
¶Another image set saugh I
Next Coveitise faste by,
And she was clepid° Avarice.
Ful foule in peinting was that vice;
Ful sadde° and caitif° was she eek,
And also grene as ony leek.
So ivel hewed was hir colour,
Hir semed have lived in langour.°
She was lik thing for hungre deed,
That ladde hir lif only by breed
Kneden° with eisel° strong and egre;°
And therto she was lene and megre.°
And she was clad ful porely,
Al in an old torn courtepy,°
As she were al with dogges torne;
And both bihinde and eek biforne
Clouted° was she beggarly.
A mantel henge hir faste by,
Upon a perche,° weike and small;
A burnet° cote heng therwithall,
Furred with no menivere,°
But with a furre rough of here,
Of lambeskinnes hevy and blake;
It was ful old, I undirtake.°
For Avarice to clothe hir wel
Ne hastith hir,° never a dell;°
For certeinly it were hir loth
To weren oft that ilke cloth;
And if it were forwered,° she
Wolde have ful greet necessitee
Of clothing, er she boughte hir newe,
Al were it bad of wolle and hewe.
This Avarice hilde° in hir hande
A purs, that henge by a bande;
And that she hidde and bond° so strong,
Men must abide wondir long
Out of that purs er ther come ought,
For that ne comth not in hir thought;
It was not, certein, hir entent
That fro that purs a penny went.
 
¶And by that image, nigh ynough,°
Was peint Envie, that never lough,°
Nor never wel in herte ferde
But if° she outher saugh or herde
Som greet mischaunce,° or greet disese.°
Nothing may so moch hir plese
As mischef and misaventure;
Or whan she seeth discomfiture
Upon a worthy man be falle,
Than liketh hir ful wel withalle.
She is ful glade in hir corage,°
If she see any great linage°
Be brought to nought in shamful wise.
And if a man in honour rise,
Or by his witte, or° by prowesse,
Of that hath she gret hevinesse;
For, trusteth wel, she goth nigh woode°
Whan any chaunce happith° goode.
Envie is of such crueltee,
That feith ne trouthe° holdith she
To freend ne felawe, bad or good.
Ne she hath kin noon of hir blood,
That she nis° ful hir enemy;
She nolde,° I dar seyn hardely,
Hir owne fader fared wel.
And sore abieth° she everydel°
Hir malice, and hir maltalent:°
For she is in so gret turment
And hath such wo, whan folk doth good,
That nigh she meltith for pure wood;°
Hir herte kervith and tobrekith°
That° God the peple wel awrekith.°
Envie, ywis,° shal never lette°
Som blame upon the folk to sette.
I trow° that if Envie, ywis,
Knew the beste man that is
On this side or biyond the see,
Yit somwhat lakken° him wold she.
And if he were so hende° and wis,
That she ne might al abate° his pris,°
Yit° wold she blame his worthinesse,
Or by hir wordes make it lesse.
 
¶I saugh Envie, in that peinting,
Hadde a wonderful° loking;
For she ne lokid but awry,°
Or overthwart,° al baggingly.°
And she hadde eek° a foule usage;°
She mighte loke in no visage
Of man or womman forthright plein,°
But shette her oon eye for disdein;°
So for envie brenned° she
Whan she might any man ysee,
That faire, or worthy were, or wis,°
Or elles stode in folkis prise.°
 
¶Sorow was peinted next Envie
Upon that wall of masonrie.°
But wel was seyn° in hir colour
That she had lived in langour;°
Hir semed to have the jaunice.°
Nought half so pale was Avarice,
Nor nothing lik, as of lenesse;°
For sorow, thought,° and gret distresse,
That she had suffred day and night
Made hir yelwe, and nothing bright,
Ful fade,° pale, and megre° also.
Was never wight yit half so wo°
As that hir semed for to be,
Nor so fulfilled of ire° as she.
I trow° that no wight° might hir plese,
Nor do that thing that might hir ese;
Nor she ne wolde hir sorow slake,°
Nor comfort noon unto hir take;
So depe° was hir wo bigonnen,°
And eek hir hert in angre ronnen,°
A sorowful thing wel semed she.
Nor she had nothing slowe be
For to forcracchen° al hir face,
And for to rent° in many place
Hir clothes, and for to tere° hir swire,°
As she that was fulfilled of ire;
And al totorn lay eek hir here°
Aboute hir shuldres, here and there,
As she that hadde it al torent
For angre and for maltalent.°
And eek I tel you certeinly
Hough that she wept ful tendirly.
In world nis° wight so harde of herte
That° hadde seen hir sorowes smerte,
That nolde° have had of her pite,
So wobegone a thing was she.
She al todassht° herself for wo,
And smoot° togider her handes two.
To sorow was she ful ententife,°
That woful rechelees caitife;°
Her roughte° litel of pleying,
Or of clipping° or of kissing;
For whoso sorouful is in herte
Him luste not° to play ne sterte,°
Nor for to dauncen, ne to singe,
Ne may his herte in temper bringe
To make joye on even or morowe;°
For joy is contraire unto sorowe.
 
¶Elde° was peinted after this,
That shorter was a foote, ywis,
Than she was wonte° in her yonghede.°
Unnethe° herself she mighte fede;
So feble and eek so old was she
That faded was al her beaute.
Ful salow° was waxen° hir colour,
Her heed forhoor° was, white as flour.
Iwis,° great qualm° ne were it none,
Ne sinne, although her lif were gone.
Al woxen° was her body unwelde,°
And drie,° and dwined° al for° elde.
A foul forwelked° thing was she
That whilom° rounde and softe had be.
Her eeres° shoken° fast withall,
As° from her heed they wolde fall.
Her face frounced° and forpined,°
And bothe her hondes lorn,° fordwined.°
So old she was that she ne went
A foot,° but it were by potent.°
 
¶The time, that passeth night and daye,
And resteless travaileth aye,°
And steleth from us so prively,
That to us semeth sikerly
That it in oon point dwelleth ever,
And certes, it ne resteth never,
But goth so faste, and passeth ay,°
That ther nis° man that thinke may
What time that now present is:
Asketh at these clerkes this;
For er men thinke it redily,
Thre times° been ypassed by.
The time, that may not sojourne,°
But goth, and never may retourne,
As water that doun renneth ay,
But never drop retourne may;
Ther may nothing as time endure,
Metal, nor erthly creature;
For all thing it frette° and shall:
The time eek, that chaungeth all,
And all doth waxe° and fostred be,°
And alle thing distroieth he:
The time, that eldith° our auncessours
And eldith kinges and emperours,
And that us al shal overcomen
Er° that dethe us shal have nomen:°
The time, that hath al in welde°
To elden° folk, had maad hir elde
So inly,° that, to my witing,°
She mighte help hirsilf nothing,°
But turned agein unto childhede;
She had nothing° hirsilf to lede,°
Ne wit ne pithe° inwith hir holde°
More than a child of two yeer olde.
But natheles, I trow° that she
Was fair sumtime, and fresh to se,
Whan she was in hir rightful age:
But she was past al that passage
And was a doted thing° bicomen.
A furred cope° on had she nomen;°
Wel had she clad hirsilf and warme,
For colde mighte els don hir harme.
These olde folk have alwey colde,
Hir kinde° is sich,° whan they ben olde.
 
¶Another thing was don ther write,°
That semed lik an ipocrite,°
And it was cleped Pope-holy.°
That ilk is she that prively
Ne spareth never a wikked dede,
Whan men of° hir taken noon hede;°
And maketh hir outward precious,°
With pale visage and pitous,°
And semeth a simple creature;
But ther nis no misaventure°
That she ne thenkith° in hir corage.°
Ful lik to hir was that image,
That makid was lik hir semblaunce.
She was ful simple of countenaunce,
And she was clothed and eke shod,°
As° she were, for the love of God,
Yolden° to religioun,
Sich° semede hir devocioun.
A sauter° held she fast in honde,
And bisily she gan to fonde°
To make many a fainte° praiere
To God, and to his seintis dere.
Ne she was gay ne fresh ne jolif,
But semed to be ful ententif
To goode werkis, and to faire,
And therto she had on an haire.°
Ne certis, she was fatt nothing,°
But semed wery° for° fasting;
Of colour pale and deed was she.
From hir the gate ay werned° be
Of paradis, that blisful place;
For sich folk maketh lene hir face,°
As Crist seith in his evangile,°
To gete° pris° in toun a while;
And for a litel glorie veigne°
They lesen° God and eke his reigne.°
 
¶And alderlast of everichon,°
Was peinted Povert al alon,
That not a penny hadde in wolde,°
Although that° she hir clothis solde,
And though she shulde anhonged be;
For nakid as a worm was she.
And if the wedir° stormy were,
For cold she shulde have dyed there.
She nadde° on but a streit° old sak,
And many a cloute° on it ther stak;°
This was hir cote and hir mantell,
No mor was ther, never a dell,°
To clothe her with; I undirtake,°
Great leiser° hadde she to quake.
And she was put, that I of talke,
Fer fro° these other, up in halke°
Ther lurked and ther coured° she,
For pover thing, wherso it be,
Is shamfast,° and despised ay.
Acursed may wel be that day,
That pover man conceived is;
For God wote° al to selde,° ywis,
Is ony pover man wel fedde,
Or wel araied° or ycledde,°
Or wel biloved, in sich wise°
In honour that he may arise.
 
¶Al these thinges, well avised,
As I have you er this° devised,°
With gold and asure° over all
Depeinted were upon the wall.
Squar was the wall, and high somdell;°
Enclosed, and ybarred wel,
In stede of hegge,° was that gardin;
Come never shepherd therin.
Into that gardin, wel ywrought,°
Whoso° that coude me have brought,
By laddris,° or els by degree,°
It wolde wel have liked° me.
For sich solace, sich joye, and play,
I trow° that never man ne say,°
As was in that place delitous.°
The gardein was not daungerous°
To herberwe° briddes many oon.
So riche a yerd° was never noon
Of briddes songe, and braunches grene.
Therin were briddes mo, I wene,°
Than been in all the rewme° of Fraunce.
Ful blissful was the accordaunce°
Of swete and pitous song thei made,
For all this world it oughte glade.
And I mysilf so mery ferde,
Whan I hir blisful songes herde,
That for an hundred pound nolde I,—
If that the passage openly
Hadde be unto me free—
That° I nolde° entren for to see
Thassemble,° God kepe° it fro care—
Of briddes, whiche therinne ware,
That songen, through hir mery throtes,
Daunces of love, and mery notes.
 
¶Whan I thus herde foules singe,
I fel fast in a weymenting,°
By which art, or by what engine°
I might come into that gardine;
But way I couthe° finde noon
Into that garden for to goon.
Ne nought wiste° I if that ther were
Either hole or place where,
By which I mighte have entre;°
Ne ther was noon to teche me;
For I was al aloon, ywis,°
For wo and angwishis of° this.
Til atte last bithought I me,°
That by no way ne might it be;
That ther nas laddre or wey to passe,
Or hole, into so faire a place.
 
¶Tho gan I go a full great pas°
Environing° evene in compas°
The closing of the square wall,
Til that I fonde a wiket° small
So shett, that I ne might in goon,
And other entre was ther noon.
 
¶Uppon this dore I gan to smite,°
That was so fetis° and so lite;°
For other way coude I not seke.
Ful long I shof,° and knocked eke,
And stood ful long and oft herkning°
If that I herde a wight° coming;
Til that the dore of thilk° entre
A maiden curteis° opened me.°
Hir heer was as yelowe of hewe
As ony basin scoured° newe.°
Hir flesshe tendre as a chike°
With bente browes,° smothe and slike;°
And by mesure large were
The opening of hir yën clere.°
Hir nose of good proporcioun,
Hir yën greye as a faucoun,°
With swete breth and wel savoured.°
Hir face white and wel coloured,
With litel mouth, and round to see;
A clove° chinne eek hadde she.
Hir nekke was of good fasoun°
In lengthe and gretness,° by resoun,
Withoute bleine,° scabbe,° or roine.°
Fro Jerusalem unto Burgoine°
Ther nis° a fairer nekke, ywis,°
To feel how smothe and softe it is.
Hir throte, also white of hewe
As snawe on braunche snawed newe.
Of body ful wel wrought was she
Men neded not, in no cuntree,
A fairer body for to seke.
And of fin orfrays° had she eke°
A chapelet:° so semly° on
Ne wered never maide upon;
And faire above that chapelet
A rose gerland had she set.
She hadde in honde a gay° mirour,
And with a riche gold tresour°
Hir heed° was tressed queintely;°
Hir sleves sewid fetously.°
And for to kepe hir hondes faire
Of gloves white she had a paire.
And she hadde on a cote of grene
Of cloth of Gaunt;° withouten wene,°
Wel semed by hir apparaile°
She was not wont° to gret travaile.°
For whan she kempt° was fetisly,°
And wel araied and richely,
Than had she doon al hir journe;°
For merry and wel bigoon° was she.
She ladde a lusty° lif in May,
She had no thought, by night ne day,
Of nothing, but it were oonly
To graithe hir° wel and uncouthly.°
 
¶Whan that this dore hadde opened me°
This maiden, semely for to see,
I thanked hir as I best might,
And axid° hir how that she hight,°
And what° she was, I axide eke.
And she to me was nought unmeke,°
Ne of hir answer daungerous,°
But faire answerde, and seide thus:—
Lo, sir, my name is Idelnesse;
So clepe° men me, more and lesse.°
Ful mighty and ful riche am I,
And that of oon thing, namely;°
For I entende° to nothing
But to my joye, and my pleying,
And for to kembe and tresse° me.
Aqueinted am I, and prive°
With Mirthe, lord of this gardine,
That fro the lande Alexandrine°
Maad the trees be hidre fette,°
That in this garden ben ysette.°
And whan the trees were woxen° on hight,
This wall, that stant heere in thy sight,
Did Mirthe enclosen al aboute;
And these images, al withoute,°
He dide hem bothe entaile° and peinte,
That neithir ben jolif ne queinte,°
But they ben ful of sorowe and woo,
As thou hast seen a while agoo.
 
¶”And ofte time, him to solace,
Sir Mirthe comth into this place,
And eek with him comth his meynee,°
That liven in lust and jolitee.°
And now is Mirthe therin, to here
The briddes, how they singen clere,
The mavis° and the nightingale,
And other joly briddes smale.
And thus he walketh to solace
Him and his folk; for swetter place
To playen inne he may not finde,
Although he sought oon intil Inde.°
The altherfairest° folk to see
That in this world may founde be
Hath Mirthe with him in his route,°
That folowen him always aboute.”
When Idelnesse had tolde al this,
And I had herkned wel, ywis,
Than seide I to dame Idelnesse,
“Now also wisly° God me blesse,
Sith° Mirth, that is so faire and fre,°
Is in this yerde with his meyne,
Fro thilk° assemble,° if I may,
Shal no man werne° me today,
That I this night ne mote° it see.
For, wel wene° I, ther with him be
A fair and joly companie
Fulfilled of alle curtesie.”
And forth, withoute wordis mo,
In at the wiket went I tho,°
That Idelnesse hadde opened me,
Into that garden fair to see.
 
¶And whan I was therin, ywis,
Min herte was ful glad of this.
For wel wende° I ful sikerly°
Have been° in paradis erthly;
So faire it was, that, trusteth wel,
It semede a place espirituel.°
For certis, as at my devis,°
Ther is no place in paradis
So good in for to dwelle or be
As in that Garden, thoughte me;
For ther was many a brid singing,
Throughout the yerde al thringing.°
In many places were nightingales,
Alpes,° finches, and wodewales,°
That in her swete song deliten
In thilke place as they habiten.
Ther mighte men see many flokkes
Of turtles° and of laverokkes.°
Chalaundres° fele° saw I there,
That wery, nigh forsongen° were.
And thrustles,° terins,° and mavis,°
That songen for to winne hem pris,°
And eek to sormounte° in hir songe
These other briddes hem amonge.
By note made fair servise
These briddes, that I you devise;
They songe hir songe as faire and wel
As angels doon espirituel.°
And, trusteth wel, whan I hem herde,
Full lustily° and wel I ferde;°
For never yitt sich melodie
Was herd of man that mighte die.°
Sich swete song was hem amonge,
That me thought it no briddis songe,
But it was wonder lik to be
Song of mermaidens of the see;
That, for° her singing is so clere,
Though we mermaidens clepe° hem here
In English, as in our usaunce,°
Men clepe hem sereins° in Fraunce.
 
¶Ententif° weren for to sing
These briddis, that nought unkunning°
Were of hir craft, and apprentis,°
But of hir song sotil° and wis.°
And certis, whan I herde her songe,
And saw the grene place amonge,°
In herte I wex so wondir gay,
That I was never erst, er that day,
So jolif, nor so wel bigo,°
Ne merie in herte, as I was tho.
And than wist° I, and saw ful well,
That Idelness me served well,
That° me putte in sich jolite.
Hir freend wel ought I for to be,
Sith she the dore of that gardine
Hadde opened, and me leten inne.
 
¶From hennesforth hou that I wrought,°
I shal you tellen, as me thought.
First, wherof° Mirthe served there,
And eek what folk ther with him were,
Withoute fable° I wol descrive.
And of that gardine eke as blive°
I wol you tellen aftir this.
The faire fasoun° al, ywis,
That wel ywrought was for the nones,°
I may not tel you all at ones:
But as I may and can, I shall
By ordre tellen you it all.
 
¶Ful fair servise and eek ful swete
These briddis maden as they sete.°
Lays° of love, ful wel sowning°
They songen in their jargoning;°
Sum high and summe eek lowe songe
Upon the braunches grene yspronge.°
The swetnesse of her melodie
Made° al min herte in reverdie.°
And whan that I had herde, I trowe,°
These briddis singing on a rowe,
Than mighte I not withholde me
That I ne wente in for to see
Sir Mirthe; for my desiring
Was him to seen, over all thing,
His countenaunce and his manere:
That sighte was to me ful dere.°
 
¶Tho wente I forth on my right honde°
Doun by a litel path I fonde
Of mentes° full, and fenell grene;
And faste by,° withoute wene,°
Sir Mirthe I fonde; and right anoon
Unto sir Mirthe gan I goon,°
Theras° he was, him to solace.°
And with him, in that lusty° place,
So fair folk and so fresh° had he,
That whan I sawe, I wondred me
Fro whennes siche folk might come,
So fair they weren, all and some;
For they were lik, as to my sight,
To angels, that ben fethered bright.
 
¶This folk, of which I tel you so,
Upon a carol° wenten tho.
A lady carolede hem,° that hight
Gladnes, the blisful and the light;
Wel coud she singe and lustily,°
Noon half so wel and semely,°
And make in song sich refreininge,°
It sat hir wondir wel to singe.
Hir vois ful cleer was and ful swete.
She was nought rude° ne unmete,°
But couthe ynow° of sich doing
As longeth° unto caroling:
For she was wont° in every place
To singen first, folk to solace;°
For singing moost she gaf hir to;°
No craft had she so leef° to do.
 
¶Tho mightest thou caroles sene,
And folke daunce and mery bene,
And made many a fair tourning°
Upon the grene gras springing.
Ther mightest thou see these floutours,°
Minstrales,° and eek jogelours,°
That wel to singe dide hir peine.°
Som songe songes of Loreine;°
For in Lorein her notes bee
Ful swetter than in this contree.
Ther was many a timbestere,°
And sailours,° that I dar wel swere
Couthe hir craft ful parfitly.°
The timbres° up ful sotilly°
They caste, and henten° hem ful ofte
Upon a finger faire and softe,
That they ne failed nevermo.
Ful fetis° damiselles two,
Right yonge, and full of semlihede,°
In kirtles,° and noon other wede,°
And faire tressed every tresse,°
Had Mirthe doon,° for his noblesse,
Amid the carol for to daunce;
But herof lith no remembraunce,°
How that they daunced queintely:°
That oon wold come al prively°
Again° that other: and whan they were
Togidre almost, they threwe yfere°
Her mouthis so, that through hir play
It semed as they kiste alway;
To dauncen well coud they the gise;°
What shulde I mor to you devise?°
Ne bede° I never thennes° go,
Whiles that I saw hem daunce so.
 
¶Upon the caroll wonder faste,°
I gan bihold; til atte laste
A lady gan me forto espie,°
And she was cleped° Curtesie,
The worshipfull, the debonaire;°
I pray God ever falle hir faire!°
Ful curteisly she called me,
“What do ye ther, beau sir?”° quod she,
“Come, and if it like yow°
To dauncen, dauncith with us now.”
And I, withoute tarying,
Wente into the caroling.
I was abasshed° never a dell,°
But it me liked righte well,
That Curtesie me cleped° so,
And bad me on the daunce go.
For if I hadde durst,° certain
I wolde have caroled right fain,°
As man that was to daunce blithe.°
Than gan I loken° ofte sithe°
The shap, the bodies, and the cheres,°
The countenaunce° and the maneres
Of all the folk that daunced there,
And I shal telle what they were.
 
¶Ful fair was Mirth, ful longe and high;°
A fairer man I never sigh.°
As rounde as appel was his face,
Ful rody and white in every place.
Fetis° he was and wel beseye,°
With metely° mouth and yën° greye;
His nose by mesure wrought ful right;
Crisp° was his heer, and eek ful bright.
His shuldris of a large brede,°
And smalish in the girdilstede.°
He semed like a portreiture,°
So noble he was of his stature,
So fair, so joly, and so fetis,°
With limes wrought at point devis,°
Deliver,° smert, and of great might;
Ne saw thou never man so light.
Of berde unnethe° hadde he nothing,
For it was in the firste spring.
Ful yonge he was, and mery of thought,
And in samet,° with briddes wrought,°
And with gold beten fetisly,
His body was clad ful richly.
Wrought was his robe in straunge gise,°
And al toslitered for queintise°
In many a place, lowe and hie.
And shod he was with greet maistrie,°
With shoon° decoped,° and with laas.°
By druerie,° and by solas,
His leef° a rosin chapelet°
Had maad, and on his heed it set.
 
¶And wite ye° who was his leef?
Dame Gladness ther was him so leef,°
That singith so wel with glad corage,
That from she was twelf yeer of age,
She of hir love graunt him made.
Sir Mirthe hir by the finger hadde
In daunsing, and she him also;
Great love was atwixe° hem two.
Both were they faire and brighte of hewe;
She semed like a rose newe
Of colour, and hir flesh so tendre,
That with a brere smale° and slendre
Men might it cleve,° I dar wel seyn.
Hir forheed, frounceles° al plein.°
Bente° were hir browis two,
Hir yën greye, and glad also,
That laugheden ay in hir semblaunt,°
First or° the mouth, by covenaunt.°
I not° what of hir nose descrive;°
So faire hath no womman alive
Hir heer was yelowe,° and cleer shining,
I wot° no lady so liking.°
Of orfrays° fresh was hir gerland;
I, which seyen have° a thousand,
Saugh never, ywis, no gerlond yit,
So wel ywrought of silk as it.
And in an overgilt samit°
Clad she was, by great delit,
Of which hir leef° a robe werde,°
The mirier she in hir hert ferde.
 
¶And next hir wente, on hir other side,
The God of Love, that can devide°
Love, as him likith it to be.
But he can cherles° daunten,° he,
And maken folkis pride fallen.
And he can wel these lordis thrallen,°
And ladies putt at lowe degree,°
Whan he may hem to° proude see.
 
¶This God of Love of his fasoun
Was lik no knave,° ne quistroun;°
His beaute gretly was to prise.°
But of his robe to devise°
I drede encombred° for to be.
For nought ycladde in silk was he,
But all in floures and flourettes,°
Ypainted° al with amorettes;°
And with losinges °and scochouns,°
With briddes, libardes,° and liouns,
And other beestis wrought ful well.
His garnement was everydell
Portreied and ywrought with floures,
By divers medling° of coloures.
Floures ther were of many gise
Yset by compas in assise;°
Ther lacked no flour, to my dome,°
Ne nought so mich as flour of brome,°
Ne violet, ne eek pervinke,°
Ne flour noon, that man can on thinke,
And many a rose leef ful longe
Was entermelled° theramonge:
And also on his heed was sette
Of roses rede a chapelette.°
But nightingales, a full great route,°
That flien over his heed aboute,
The leeves felden° as they flien;
And he was all with briddes wrien,°
With popinjay,° with nightingale,
With chalaundre,° and with wodewale,°
With finch, with lark, and archaungell.°
He semede as he were an aungell
That doun were comen fro heven clere.
 
¶Love had with him a bachelere,°
That he made always with him be;
Swete-Loking cleped° was he.
This bacheler stood biholding
The daunce, and in his hond holding
Turke bowes two hadde he.
That oon of hem was of a tree
That bereth a fruit of savour wikke;°
Ful crokid was that foule stikke,
And knotty here and there also,
And blak as bery, or any slo.°
That other bow was of a plante
Withoute wem,° I dar warante,
Ful even, and by proporcioun
Treitis° and long, of good fasoun.
And it was peinted wel and thwitten,°
And over-al diapred° and writen
With ladies and with bacheleris,
Ful lightsom and ful glad of cheris.
These bowes two held Swet-Loking,
That semed lik no gadeling.°
And ten brode arowes hilde° he there,
Of which five in his right hond were.
But they were shaven wel and dight,°
Nokked° and fethered aright;
And all they were with gold bigoon,°
And stronge pointed everichoon,
And sharpe for to kerven wele.
But iren was ther noon ne stele;
For al was gold, men might it see,
Outtake° the fethers and the tree.°
 
¶The swiftest of these arowis five
Out of a bowe for to drive,
And best yfethered for to flee,
And fairest eek, was cleped° Beautee.
That other arowe, that hurteth lesse,
Was clepid, as I trow, Simplesse.
The thridde cleped was Fraunchise,°
That fethred was, in noble wise,
With valour and with curtesie.
The fourth was cleped Compaignie°
That hevy for to shoten is;
But whoso shetith right, ywis,
May therwith doon great harm and wo.
The fifte of these, and laste also,
Fair-Semblaunt° men that arow calle,
The leeste grevous of hem alle;
Yit can it make a ful great wounde,
But he may hope his soris° sounde,°
That hurte is with that arowe, ywis;
His wo the bet bistowed is.°
For he may sonner have gladnesse,
His langour° oughte be the lesse.
¶Five arowis were of other gise,°
That been ful foule to devise;
For shaft and end, soth for to telle,
Were also° blak as fende° in helle.
 
¶The first of hem is called Pride;
That other arow next him biside,
It was ycleped Vilanie;°
That arow was with felonie°
Envenimed, and with spitous° blame.
The thridde of hem was cleped Shame.
The fourthe, Wanhope° cleped is,
The fift, the Newe-Thought, ywis.
 
¶These arowis that I speke of heere,
Were alle five of oon maneere,
And alle were they resemblable.
To hem was wel sitting and able
The foule croked bow hidous,
That knotty was, and al roinous.°
That bowe semed wel to shete
These arowis five, that been unmete,°
And contrarie to that other five.
But though I telle not as blive°
Of her power, ne of her might,
Herafter shal I tellen right
The soothe, and eek signifiaunce,
As fer as I have remembraunce:
All shal be seid, I undertake,°
Er of this book an ende I make.
 
¶Now come I to my tale agein.
But aldirfirst,° I wol you seyn
The fasoun and the countenaunces
Of all the folk that on the daunce is.
The God of Love, jolif and light,
Ladde on his honde a lady bright,
Of high pris,° and of great degree.
This lady called was Beautee,
And an arowe, of which I tolde.
Ful wel ythewed° was she holde;°
Ne she was derk ne broun, but bright,
And clere as the moonelight,
Agein whom all the sterres semen
But smale candels, as we demen.°
Hir flesh was tendre as dewe of flour,
Hir chere° was simple as birde° in bour;°
As white as lilie or rose in ris,°
Hir face gentil and tretis.°
Fetis° she was, and smal° to see;
No windred° browis hadde she,
Ne popped° hir, for it neded nought
To windre hir,° or peinte hir ought.
Hir tresses yelowe, and longe straughten,°
Unto hir heles doun they raughten:°
Hir nose, hir mouth, and eye and cheke
Wel wrought, and al the remenaunt eke.
A ful great savour° and a swote°
Me toucheth in min herte rote,
As help me God, whan I remembre
Of the fasoun of every membre!
In world is noon so faire a wight;°
For yong she was, and hewed bright,°
Sore plesaunt,° and fetis withall,
Gente,° and in hir middill small.°
 
¶Biside Beaute yede° Richesse,
An high lady of greet noblesse,
And gret of pris° in every place.
But whoso durst° to hir trespace,°
Or til hir folk,° in worde or dede,
He were full hardy,° out of drede;°
For both she helpe and hindre may:
And that is nought of yisterday°
That riche folk have full gret might
To helpe, and eek to greve° a wight.
The beste and grettest of valour
Diden° Richess ful gret honour,
And besy weren hir to serve;
For that they wolde hir love deserve,°
They cleped hir “Lady,” grete and small;
This wide world hir dredith° all;
This world is al in hir daungere.°
Hir court hath many a losengere,°
And many a traitour envious,
That been ful besy and curious°
For to dispreisen,° and to blame
That best deserven love and name.
Bifor the folk, hem to bigilen,°
These losengeris hem preise, and smilen,
And thus the world with word anointen;°
But afterward they thrill° and pointen°
The folk right to the bare boon,
Bihind her bak whan they ben goon,
And foule abate° the folkis pris.°
Ful many a worthy man and wis,
An hundrid, have they don° to die,
These losengers, through flaterie;
And maketh folk ful straunge° be,
Theras° hem oughte be prive.°
Wel ivel° mot they thrive and thee,°
And ivel arived° mot° they be,
These losengers, ful of envie!
No good man loveth hir companie.
 
¶Richesse a robe of purpur° on hadde,
Ne trow° not that I lie or madde;°
For in this world is noon hir liche,
Ne by a thousand deell° so riche,
Ne noon so fair; for it° ful well
With orfrays° leid° was everydeell,
And portraied° in the ribaninges°
Of dukes stories, and of kinges.
And with a bend° of gold tasseled,
And knoppis° fine of gold ameled.°
About hir nekke of gentil° entaile°
Was shet° the riche chevesaile,°
In which ther was full gret plentee
Of stones° clere and bright to see.
 
¶Richesse a girdell° hadde upon,
The bokele of it was of a stoon
Of vertu° gret, and moche of might;
For whoso bar° the stoon so bright,
Of venim thurte him° nothing doute,°
Whil he the stoon had him aboute.
That stoon was gretly for to love,
And til° a riche mannes bihove°
Worth all the gold in Rome and Frise.°
The mourdaunt,° wrought in noble wise,
Was of a stoon full precious,
That was so fine and vertuous,
That hole° a man it coude make
Of palasie,° and of toothake.
And yit the stoon had such a grace,
That he was siker° in every place,
All thilke° day, not blind to been,
That fasting might that stone seen.
The barres° were of gold ful fine,
Upon a tissu° of satine,
Ful hevy, gret, and nothing light,
In everich° was a besaunt wight.°
 
¶Upon the tresses of Richesse
Was sette a cercle, for noblesse,
Of brend° gold, that full lighte shoon;
So fair, trowe° I, was never noon.
But he were cunning, for the nones,
That coud devise all the stones
That in that cercle shewen clere;
It is a wondir thing to here.
For no man coude preise° or gesse
Of hem the valewe or richesse.
Rubies there were, saphires, jagounces,°
And emeraudes, more than two ounces.
But all bifore, ful sotilly,
A fin charboncle° set saugh I.
The stoon so cleer was and so bright,
That, also soone as it was night,
Men might seen to go,° for nede,°
A mile or two, in lengthe and brede.
Sich light sprang oute of the stoon,
That Richesse wondir brighte shoon,
Bothe hir heed, and all hir face,
And eke aboute hir al the place.
 
¶Dame Richesse on hir hond gan lede
A yong man ful of semlihede,°
That she best loved of ony thing;
His lust° was mich in housholding.°
In clothing was he ful fetis,°
And loved to have hors of pris.°
He wend° to have reproved be°
Of thefte or moordre, if that he
Hadde in his stable an hakeney.°
And therfore he desired ay
To ben aqueinted with Richesse;
For all his purpos, as I gesse,
Was for to make greet dispense,
Withoute werning° or diffense.°
And Richess might it wel sustene,
And hir dispences wel maintene,
And him alwey sich plente sende
Of gold and silver for to spende
Withoute lakke° or daunger,°
As° it were poured in a garner.°
 
¶And after on the daunce wente
Largess,° that sette al hir entente
For to be honourable and free;°
Of Alexandres kin was she;
Hir moste joye was, ywis,
Whan that she yaf, and seide, “Have this.”
Not Avarice, the foul caitif,°
Was half to gripe° so ententif,°
As Largesse is to yeve° and spende.
And God ynough alwey hir sende,
So that the mor she yaf awey,
The more, ywis, she hadde alwey.
Gret loos° hath Largesse, and gret pris;°
For bothe wis folk and unwis
Were hooly° to hir baundon° brought,
So wel with yiftes hath she wrought.
And if she hadde an enemy,
I trow, that she coud craftily
Make him ful soone hir freend to be,
So large of yift and free was she;
Therfore she stode in love and grace
Of riche and pouer in every place.
A full gret fool is he, ywis,
That bothe riche and nigart° is.
A lord may have no maner vice
That greveth more than avarice.
For nigart never with strengthe of hond
May winne him greet lordship or lond.
For freendis all to fewe hath he
To doon° his wil perfourmed be.
And whoso wole have freendis heere,
He may not holde his tresour deere.
For by ensample I tell this,
Right as an adamant,° ywis,
Can drawen to him sotilly°
The iren, that is leid therby,°
So drawith folkes hertis, ywis,
Silver and gold that yeven° is.
 
¶Largesse hadde on a robe fresh
Of riche purpur Sarsinesh.°
Wel fourmed was hir face and clere,
And opened had she hir colere;
For she right there hadde in present°
Unto a lady maad present
Of a gold broche, ful wel wrought.
And certes, it missatte° hir nought;
For through hir smocke, wrought with silke,
The flesh was seen, as white as milke.
Largess, that worthy was and wis,
Hild by the honde a knight of pris,°
Was° sib° to Arthour of Bretaigne.°
And that was he that bar the enseigne°
Of worship, and the gonfanoun.°
And yit° he is of sich renoun,
That men of him say faire thinges
Bifore barouns, erles, and kinges.
This knight was comen all newely
Fro tourneyinge° faste by;°
Ther hadde he doon gret chivalrie°
Through his vertu° and his maistrie;°
And for the love of his lemman°
He cast doun many a doughty° man.
¶And next him daunced dame Fraunchise,°
Arraied in ful noble gise.
She was not broun ne dunne° of hewe,
But white as snowe yfallen newe.
Hir nose was wrought at point devis,°
For it was gentil and tretis;°
With eyen gladde, and browes bente;
Hir heer doun to hir helis wente.
And she was simple as dowve on tree,
Ful debonaire° of hert was she.
She durste° never seyn ne do
But that thing that hir longed to.°
And if a man were in distresse,
And for hir love in hevinesse,
Hir hert wolde have ful greet pitee,
She was so amiable and free.°
For were a man for hir bistadde,°
She wolde ben right sore adradde
That she dide over gret outrage,°
But° she him holpe° his harm t’aswage;°
Hir° thoughte it al a vilanie.°
And she hadde on a sukkenie,°
That not of hempe° ne heerdis° was;
So fair was noon in all Arras.
Lord, it was ridled° fetisly!°
Ther nas nat a point, trewly,
That it nas in his right assise.°
Full wel yclothed was Fraunchise;
For ther is no cloth sittith bet
On damiselle, than doth roket.°
A womman wel more fetis is
In roket than in cote, ywis.
The white roket, ridled faire,
Bitokeneth, that full debonaire
And swete was she that it bere.
 
¶By hir daunced a bachelere;
I can not tell you what he hight,°
But fair he was, and of good hight,
All hadde he be,° I sey no more,
The lordis sone of Windesore.°
 
¶And next that daunced Curtesie,
That preised was of lowe and hie,
For neither proud ne fool was she.
She for to daunce called me,
(I pray God yeve hir right good grace!)
Whan I com first into the place.
She was not nice,° ne outrageous,°
But wis and war,° and vertuous,
Of faire speche, and faire answere;
Was never wight misseid of° here;
She bar no rancour to no wight.
Cleer broun she was, and therto bright
Of face, of body avenaunt;°
I wot° no lady so plesaunt.
She were worthy for to bene
An emperesse or crouned quene.
 
¶And by hir wente a knight dauncing
That worthy was and wel speking,
And ful wel coude he don honour.
The knight was fair and stif in stour,°
And in armure a semely° man,
And wel biloved of his lemman.°
 
¶Faire Idelnesse than saugh I,
That alwey was me faste by.°
Of hir have I, withouten faile,
Told yow the shap and apparaile
For (as I seid) lo, that was she
That did to me so greet bountee,°
That she the gate of the gardin
Undide, and let me passen in.
 
¶And after daunced, as I gesse,
Youth, fulfild of lustinesse,°
That nas not yit twelf yeer of age,
With herte wilde, and thought volage;°
Nice° she was, but she ne mente
Noon harm ne slight in hir entente,
But oonly lust and jolite.°
For yonge folk, wel witen ye,
Have litel thought but on hir play.
Hir lemman was biside alway,
In sich a gise, that he hir kiste
At alle times that him liste,°
That al the daunce mighte it see;
They make no force° of privetee;
For who spake of hem ivel or well,
They were ashamed never a dell,°
But men might seen hem kisse there,
As it two yonge dowves were.
For yong was thilke° bachelere,
Of beaute wot° I noon his pere;°
And he was right of sich an age
As Youthe his leef,° and sich corage.°
 
¶The lusty folk that daunced there,
And also other that with hem were,
That weren alle of hir meynee;°
Ful hende° folk, and wis, and free,°
And folk of faire port, truly,
Ther were alle comunly.
 
¶Whanne I had seen the countenaunces
Of hem that ladden thus these daunces,
Than hadde I wil° to gon and see
The gardin that so liked me,
And loken on these faire loreres,°
On pin-trees, cedres, and oliveres.
The daunces than y-ended were;
For many of hem that daunced there
Were° with her loves went awey
Undir the trees to have hir pley.
 
¶A, lord! they lived lustily!°
A gret fool were he, sikirly,°
That nolde,° his thankes,° such lif lede!
For this dar I seyn, oute of drede,
That whoso mighte so wel fare,
For better lif durst° him not care;°
For ther nis so good paradis
As have a love at his devis.°
 
¶Oute of that place wente I tho,
And in that gardin gan I go,
Pleying along ful merily.
The God of Love full hastely
Unto him Swete-Loking clepte,°
No lenger wolde he° that he kepte
His bowe of gold, that shoon so bright.
He bad him bende it anonright;°
And he full soone sette on ende,
And at a braid° he gan it bende,
And toke him of° his arowes five,
Ful sharpe and redy for to drive.
Now God that sittith in magestee
Fro deedly woundes kepe me,
If so be that he had me shette;°
For if I with his arowe mette,
It had me greved sore, ywis!
But I, that nothing wiste° of this,
Wente up and doun full many a wey,
And he me folwed fast alwey;
But nowher wold I reste me,
Til I hadde in al the gardin be.
 
¶The gardin was, by mesuring,
Right evene and square in compassing;°
It as long was as it was large.°
Of fruit hadde every tree his charge,°
But it were° any hidous tree
Of which ther were two or three.
Ther were, and that wote I full well,
Of pomgarnettes° a ful gret del;
That is a fruit full well to like,
Namely° to folk whan they ben sike.
And trees ther were of gret foisoun,°
That baren notes° in her sesoun,
Such as men notemigges° calle,
That swote of savour been withalle.
And alemandres° gret plentee,
Figes, and many a date-tree
Ther weren, if men hadde nede,
Through the gardin in length and brede.
Ther was eek wexing° many a spice,
As clow-gelofre,° and licorice,
Gingere, and grein de paradis,°
Canell,° and setewale° of pris,°
And many a spice delitable,
To eten whan men rise fro table.
And many hoomly° trees ther were,
That peches, coines,° and apples beere,°
Medlers,° ploumes, peris, chesteines,°
Cheris, of whiche many oon faine° is,
Notes,° aleys,° and bolas,°
That for to seen it was solas;
With many high lorer° and pin°
Was renged° clene° all that gardin;
With cipres, and with oliveris,
Of which that nigh no plente° here is.
Ther were elmes grete and stronge,
Maples, asshe, oke, asp,° planes longe,°
Fine ew,° popler, and lindes° faire,
And other trees full many a paire.
 
¶What shulde I tel you more of it?
Ther were so many trees yit,
That I shulde al encombred° be
Er° I had rekened every tree.
 
¶These trees were set, that I devise,
Oon from another, in assise,°
Five fadome° or sixe, I trowe° so,
But they were hie and great also:
And for to kepe out wel the sonne,
The croppes° were so thicke yronne,
And every braunche in other knitte,
And ful of grene leves sitte,°
That sonne mighte noon discende,
Lest it the tender grasses shende.°
Ther might men does and roes° yse,°
And of squirels ful great plente,
From bow° to bow alway lepinge.
Conies° ther were also playinge,
That comin out of her clapers°
Of sondrie colours and maners,
And maden many a tourneying°
Upon the fresshe gras springing.
 
¶In places sawe I welles there,
In whiche ther no frogges were,
And faire in shadwe was every wel;
But I ne can the nombre tel
Of stremis smal, that by devise°
Mirthe had don come° through condise°
Of which the water, in renning,
Gan make a noise ful liking.°
 
¶About the brinkes° of these welles,°
And by the stremes overal elles
Sprange up the gras, as thicke yset
And softe as any veluet,
On which men mighte his lemman ley,
As on a fetherbed, to pley,
For th’erthe was ful softe and swete.
Through moisture of the welle wete
Spronge up the sote° grene gras,
As faire, as thicke, as mister was.°
But moche amended it the place,
That therthe was of suche a grace
That it of floures had plente,
That bothe in somer and winter be.
 
¶Ther sprang the violete al newe,
And fresshe pervinke,° riche of hewe,
And floures yelow, white, and rede;
Such plente grew ther never in mede.°
Ful gay was al the grounde, and queint,°
And poudred,° as men had it peint,
With many a fresshe and sondrie flour,
That casten up ful good savour.
 
¶I wol nat long holde you in fable
Of al this garden delitable.
I moot° my tonge stinten° nede,
For I ne may, withouten drede,°
Naught tellen you the beaute al,
Ne half the bounte therwithal.
 
¶I went on right honde and on lefte
About the place; it was nat lefte,
Til I had al the garden been,
In the estres° that men mighte seen.
And thus while I wente in my playe,
The God of Love me folowed aye,
Right as an hunter can abide°
The beste,° til he seeth his tide°
To shete, at good mes,° to the dere,
Whan that him nedeth go no nere.°
 
¶And so befil, I rested me
Beside a wel, under a tree,
Which tree in Fraunce men cal a pine.
But, sith the time of king Pepine,
Ne grew ther tree in mannes sight
So fair, ne so wel woxe° in hight;
In al that yard so high was none.
And springing in° a marble-stone
Had nature set, the soth to tel,
Under that pine tree a wel.
And on the border, al without,°
Was written, in the stone about,
Letters smal, that saiden thus,
“Here starf° the faire Narcisus.”
 
¶Narcisus was a bachelere,°
That Love had caught in his dangere,°
And in his net gan him so straine,
And dide him so to wepe and plaine,°
That nede him must his lif forgo.
For a fair lady, hight° Echo,
Him loved over any creature,
And gan for him such paine endure,
That on a time she him tolde,
That, if he hir loven nolde,°
That her behoved nedes° die,
Ther lay none other remedie.
But natheless, for his beaute,
So fiers° and daungerous° was he,
That he nold graunten hir asking,
For weping, ne for fair praying.
And whan she herd him werne° soo,
She hadde in herte so gret woo,
And toke it in so gret dispite,°
That she, withoute more respite,
Was deed anoon. But, er she deide,
Ful pitously to God she preide,
That proude-hertid Narcisus,
That was in love so daungerous,
Might on a day ben hampred so
For love, and been so hoot for wo,
That never he might joye atteine;
Than shuld he fele in every veine
What sorow trewe lovers maken,
That ben so velainesly° forsaken.
 
¶This prayer was but resonable,
Therfor God helde it ferme and stable:
For Narcisus, shortly to telle,
By aventure° com to that welle
To rest him in that shadowing
A day, whan he com fro hunting.
This Narcisus had suffred paines
For renning alday in the plaines,
And was for thurst in great distresse
Of heet and of his werinesse
That hadde his breth almost binomen.°
Whan he was to that wel ycomen,
That shadowid was with braunches grene,
He thoughte of thilke water shene°
To drinke and fresshe him° wel withall;
And doun on knees he gan to fall,
And forth his heed and necke outstraught°
To drinken of that welle a draught
And in the water anoon was seen
His nose, his mouth, his yën sheen,
And he therof was all abasshed;°
His own shadow° had him bitrasshed.°
For well wende° he the forme see
Of a child of gret beautee.
Wel couthe Love him wreke° thoo
Of daunger° and of pride also,
That Narcisus somtime him bere.
He quitte° him well his guerdon° there;
For he so musede in the welle,
That, shortly all the soth to telle,
He lovede his owne shadow soo,
That atte last he starf° for woo.
For whan he saugh that he his will°
Might in no maner wey fulfill,
And that he was so faste caught
That he him couthe comfort naught,
He loste his wit right in that place,
And died within a litel space.
And thus his warisoun° he took
For the lady that he forsook.
¶Ladies, I preye ensample takith,
Ye that ageins your love mistakith:°
For if her deth be yow to wite,°
God can ful well your while quite.
 
¶When that this lettre,° of whiche I telle,
Had taught me that it was the welle
Of Narcisus in his beaute,
I gan anoon withdrawe me,
Whanne it felle in my remembraunce,
That him bitidde such mischaunce.
But at the laste than thought I,
That scatheles,° full sikerly,
I might unto the welle goo.
Wherof shulde I abaisshen° soo?
Unto the well than wente I me,
And doun I louted° for to see
The clere water in the stoon,
And eek the gravell, which that shoon
Down in the botme, as silver fin;°
For of the well, this is the fin,°
In world is noon so clere of hewe.
The water is ever fresh and newe
That welmeth up° with wawis° bright
The mountance° of two finger hight.°
Abouten it is gras springing,
For moist° so thikke and wel liking,
That it ne may in winter die,
No more than may the see be drie.
 
¶Downe at the botme set sawe I
Two cristall stonis craftely°
In thilke° fresh and faire well.
But o thing sothly dar I tell,
That ye wol holde° a greet mervaile
Whanne it is told, withouten faile.
For whan the sonne, clere in sight,
Cast in that well his bemis bright,
And that the heet descended is,
Than taketh the cristall stoon, ywis,
Again the sonne an hundrid hewis,
Blew, yelowe, and rede, that fresh and newe is.
Yitt hath the merveilous cristall
Such strength,° that the place overall,
Both foule° and tree, and leves grene,
And all the yerde in it is sene.
And for to doon you undirstonde,
To make ensample wole I fonde;°
Right as a mirour openly°
Shewith all thing that stondeth therby,
As well the colour as the figure,
Withouten ony coverture;°
Right so the cristall stoon, shining,
Withouten ony disseiving,°
The estres° of the yerde accusith°
To him that in the water musith;°
For evere, in which half that he be,
He may well half the gardin se;
And if he turne, he may right well
Seen the remenaunt everydell.°
For ther is noon so litil thing
So hid, ne closid with shitting,°
That it nis° sene, as though it were
Peintid in the cristall there.
 
¶This is the mirour perilous,°
In which the proude Narcisus
Sawe all his face faire and bright,
That made him sith° to lie upright.°
For whoso loke in that mirrour,
Ther may nothing ben his socour°
That he ne shall ther seen som thing
That shal him lede into loving.
Full many a worthy man hath it
Yblent;° for folk of grettist wit
Ben soone caught heere and awaited;°
Withouten respit ben they baited.°
Heer comth to folk of newe rage,°
Heer chaungith many wight° corage;°
Heer lith no reed ne wit° therto;
For Venus son, daun° Cupido,
Hath sowne° there of love the seed,
That help ne lith ther noon, ne reed,
So cerclith it the welle aboute.
His ginnes° hath he sett withoute
Right for to cacche in his panters°
These damoisels and bachelers.
Love wil noon other bridde° cacche,
Though he sette either nette or lacche.°
And for the seed that heer was sowen,
This welle is clepid,° as well is knowen,
The Welle of Love, of verray right,
Of which ther hath ful many a wight
Spoken in bookis diversely.
But they shull never so verily
Descripcioun of the welle heere,°
Ne eek the sothe of this matere,
As ye shull, whanne I have undo°
The craft° that hir bilongith° to.
 
¶Allway me liked for to dwelle,
To seen the cristal in the welle,
That shewed me full openly
A thousand thinges faste by.°
But I may say, in sory houre
Stode I to loken or to poure;°
For sithen have I sore siked,°
That mirour hath me now entriked.°
But hadde I first knowen in my wit
The vertue° and the strengthe of it,
I nolde not° have mused there;
Me hadde bet° ben elliswhere;
For in the snare I fell anoon,
That hath bitraisshed° many oon
 
¶In thilke mirour saw I tho,°
Among a thousand thinges mo,
A Roser° charged full of rosis,
That with an hegge aboute enclos is.
Tho had I sich lust° and envie,°
That, for Paris ne for Pavie,°
Nolde I have left to goon and see
Ther grettist hepe° of roses be.
Whanne I was with this rage° hent,°
That caught hath many a man and shent,°
Toward the roser gan I go.
And whanne I was not fer therfro,
The savour of the roses swote°
Me smoot° right to the herte rote,°
As I hadde all embawmed° be.
And if I ne hadde endouted me°
To have ben hatid or assailed,
My thankis,° wolde I not have failed
To pulle° a rose of all that route°
To beren in min honde aboute,
And smellen to it where I wente;
But ever I dred me to repente,
And leste it greved or forthought°
The lord that thilke gardin wrought.
Of roses were ther gret wone,°
So faire waxe never in rone.°
Of knoppes° clos, some sawe I there
And some wel beter° woxen were;
And some ther been of other moisoun,°
That drowe nigh to her sesoun,
And spedde hem faste° for to sprede;
I love well suche roses rede;
For brode roses, and open also,
Ben passed in a day or two;
But knoppes° wilen fresshe be
Two dayes atte leest, or thre.
The knoppes gretly liked me,
For fairer may ther no man se.
Whoso mighte haven oon of all,
It ought him ben full lief° withall.
Mighte I a gerlond of hem geten,
For no richesse I wolde it leten.°
 
¶Among the knoppes I chese oon
So fair, that of the remenaunt noon
Ne preise I half so well as it,
Whanne I avise it in my wit.
For it so wel was enlumined
With colour reed, as well yfined°
As nature couthe it make faire.
And it hath leves wel foure paire,
That Kinde° hath set through his knowing
About the redde rose springing.
The stalke was as risshe° right,°
And theron stood the knoppe upright,
That it ne bowide upon no side.
The swote smelle sprong so wide
That it dide all the place aboute—

Whanne I had smelled the savour swote,
No will hadde I fro thens yit go,
But somdell° neer it wente I tho,
To take it; but min hond, for drede,
Ne dorste I to the rose bede,°
For thistels sharpe, of many maneres,
Netles, thornes, and hoked breres;°
Ful moche they distourbled° me,
For sore I drad to harmed be.
 
¶The God of Love, with bowe bent,
That all day set hadde his talent°
To pursuen and to spien me,
Was stonding by a fige-tree.
And whanne he sawe hou that I
Had chosen so ententifly°
The bothon,° more unto my pay°
Than ony other that I say,
He toke an arowe full sharply whette,°
And in his bowe whanne it was sette,
He streight up to his ere drough°
The stronge bow, that was so tough,
And shette at me so wondir smert,°
That through min eye unto min hert
The takel° smote,° and depe it wente.
And therwithall such cold me hente,°
That, under clothes warme and softe,
Sith° that day I have chevered° ofte.
 
¶Whanne I was hurt thus in that stounde,°
I fell doun plat unto the grounde.
Min herte failed and feinted ay,
And long time ther aswoone° I lay.
But whanne I come out of swoning,
And hadde witt, and my feling,
I was al maate,° and wend° full well
Of blood have loren° a full gret dell.°
But certes, the arow that in me stode
Of me ne drew no drope of blode,
Forwhy I found my wounde al dreie.°
Than toke I with min hondis tweie°
The arowe, and ful fast out it plight,°
And in the pulling sore° I sight.°
So at the last the shaft of tree°
I drough out, with the fethers three.
But yet the hoked heed, ywis,
The whiche Beautee callid is,
Gan so depe in min hert passe,
That I it mighte nought arace;°
But in min herte still it stode,
Al° bledde I not a drope of blode.
I was bothe anguissous and trouble°
For the perill that I saw double;
I niste what to seye or do,
Ne gete a leche° my woundis two;
For neithir thurgh gras ne rote,
Ne hadde I helpe of hope ne bote.°
But to the bothon evermo
Min herte drew; for all my wo,
My thought was in noon other thing.
For hadde it been in my keping,
It wold have brought my lif again.
For certeinly, I dar wel seyn,
The sight oonly, and the savour,
Alegged° mich of my langour.
 
¶Than gan I for to drawe me
Toward the bothon fair to see;
And Love had get him, in his throwe,°
Another arowe into his bowe,
And for to shete gan him dresse;°
The arowis name was Simplesse.°
And whan that Love gan nigh me nere,°
He drowe it up, withouten were,°
And shette at me with all his might,
So that this arowe anoonright
Thourghout min eigh, as it was founde,
Into min hert hath maad a wounde.
Thanne I anoon dide al my crafte°
For to drawen out the shafte,
And therwithall I sighed eft.°
But in min hert the heed was left,
Which ay encresed my desire,
Unto the bothon° drawe° nere;
And ever, mo that me was woo,
The more desir hadde I to goo
Unto the roser, where that grew
The freisshe bothon so bright of hewe.
Betir me were have laten° be;
But it bihoved nedes me°
To don right as min herte badde.°
For ever the body must be ladde
Aftir° the herte; in wele° and woo,
Of force togidre they must goo.
But never this archer wolde feine°
To shete at me with all his peine,°
And for to make me to him mete°
 
¶The thridde arowe he gan to shete,
Whan best his time he might espie,
The which was named Curtesie;
Into min herte it dide avale.°
Aswoone I fell, both deed and pale;
Long time I lay, and stired nought,
Till I abraide° out of my thought.
And faste thanne I avised me°
To drawen out the shafte of tree;°
But ever the heed was left bihinde
For ought I couthe pulle or winde.°
So sore° it sticked whanne I was hit,
That by no craft I might it flit;°
But anguissous and full of thought,
I felt such wo, my wounde ay wrought,
That somoned me alway to goo
Toward the rose, that plesed me soo;
But I ne durste in no manere,
Bicause the archer was so nere.
For evermore gladly, as I rede,
Brent° child of fier° hath mich drede.
And, certis yit, for al my peine,
Though that I sigh yit arwis reine,°
And grounde quarels° sharpe of steell,
Ne for no pain that I might feell,
Yit might I not mysilf withholde°
The faire roser to biholde;
For Love me yaf° sich hardement°
For to fulfille his comaundement.
Upon my feet I roos up than
Feble, as a forwoundid man;
And forth to gon my might I sette,
And for° the archer nolde I lette.°
Toward the roser° fast I drow;
But thornes sharp mo than ynow
Ther were, and also thistels thikke,
And breres,° brimme° for to prikke,
That I ne mighte gete grace
The rowe° thornes for to passe,
To seen the roses fresshe of hewe.
I must abide, though it me rewe,°
The hegge about so thikke was,
That closed the roses in compas.°
 
¶But o thing liked me right well;
I was so nigh,° I mighte fell
Of the bothon the swote odour,
And also see the fresh colour;
And that right gretly liked me,
That I so nere might it see.
Sich joie anoon therof hadde I,
That I forgat my malady.
To sene it hadde I sich delit,
Of sorwe and angre I was al quit,°
And of my woundes that I had thore;°
For nothing liken me might more
Than dwellen by the roser ay,
And thennes never to passe away.°
 
¶But whanne a while I had be thare,
The God of Love, which al toshare°
Min herte with his arwis kene,
Caste° him to yeve me woundis grene.°
He shette° at me ful hastily
An arwe named Company,
The whiche takell° is ful able
To make these ladies merciable.
Thanne I anoon gan chaungen hewe
For grevaunce of my wounde newe,
That I again fell in swoning,°
And sighed sore in compleining.
Soore I compleined that my sore
On me gan greven more and more.
I had non hope of allegeaunce;°
So nigh I drow to desperaunce,°
I rought° of dethe ne of lif,
Whether° that love wold me drif.
If me a martir wolde he make,
I might his power nought forsake.
And whil for anger thus I woke,°
The God of Love an arowe toke;
Ful sharpe it was and ful pugnaunt,°
And it was callid Fair-Semblaunt,
The which in no wis wol consente,
That ony lover him repente
To serve his love with herte and all,
For ony perill that may bifall.
But though this arwe was kene grounde
As ony rasour that is founde,
To cutte and kerve, at the point,
The God of Love it hadde anoint
With a precious oinement,
Somdell to yeve aleggement°
Upon the woundes that he hadde
Through the body in my herte madde,°
To help her sores, and to cure,
And that they may the bette endure.
But yit this arwe, withoute more,
Made in min herte a large sore,
That in full great peine I abode.°
But ay the oinement wente abrode;
Throughout my woundes large and wide
It spredde aboute in every side;
Through whos vertu and whose might
Min herte joyful was and light.
I had ben deed and al toshent°
But for the precious oinement.
The shaft I drowe out of the arwe,
Roking for wo° right wondir narwe;°
But the heed, which made me smerte,
Lefte bihinde in min herte
With other foure, I dar wel say,
That never wol be take away;
But the oinement halp me wele.
And yit sich sorwe dide I fele,
That alday I chaunged hewe,
Of my woundes fresshe and newe,
As men might see in my visage.
The arwis were so full of rage,°
So variaunt of diversitee,
That men in everich might see
Both gret anoy° and eek swetnesse,
And joie meint° with bittirnesse.
Now were they esy, now were they wood,°
In hem I felt bothe harm and good;
Now sor without aleggement,°
Now softening with oinement;
It softned here, and prikked there,
Thus ese and anger togidre were.
 
¶The God of Love deliverly°
Com lepand° to me hastily,
And seid to me, in grete rape,°
“Yeld thee, for thou may not escape!
May no defence avail thee here;
Therfore I red° mak no daungere.°
If thou wolt yeld thee hastily,
Thou shalt the rather° have mercy.
He is a foole in sikernesse,
That with daunger or stoutenesse°
Rebellith ther that° he shuld plese;
In sich folie is litel ese.
Be meek, wher thou must nedis bowe;
To strive agein° is nought thi prowe.°
Come at ones, and have ydo,
For I wol that it be so.
Than yeld thee here debonairly.”°
And I answerid ful humbly,
“Gladly, sir; at your bidding,
I wol me yelde in alle thing.
To your servise I wol me take;°
For God defend° that I shuld make
Agein your bidding resistence;
I wol not don so gret offence;
For if I dide, it were no skile.°
Ye may do with me what ye wile,
Save or spille,° and also sloo;°
Fro you in no wise may I goo.
My lif, my deth, is in your honde,
I may not laste° out of your bonde.
Plein° at your list° I yelde me,
Hoping in hert, that sumtime ye
Comfort and ese shull me sende;
Or ellis shortly, this is the ende,
Withouten helthe I mote ay dure,°
But if° ye tak me to your cure.°
Comfort or helth how shuld I have,
Sith ye me hurt, but ye me save?
The helthe of love moot be founde
Wheras they token firste hir wounde.
And if ye list of me to make
Your prisoner, I wole it take
Of herte and will, fully at gree.°
Hoolly and plein I yelde me,
Withoute feining or feintise,°
To be governed by youre emprise.°
Of you I here so moche pris,
I wol ben hool at your devis
For to fulfille your liking
And repente for nothing,
Hoping to have yit in som tide°
Mercy, of that that I abide.”°
And with that covenaunt° yelde I me,
Anoon doun kneling upon my kne,
Profering for to kisse his feet;
But for nothing he wold me lete,°
And seide, “I love thee bothe and preise,
Sens that thin answer doth me ese,
For thou answerid so curteisly.
For now I wot° wel uttirly,
That thou art gentill,° by thi speche.
For though a man fer wolde seche,
He shuld not finden, in certein,
No sich answer of no vilein;°
For sich a word ne mighte nought
Isse° out of a vilains thought.
Thou shalt not lesen of thi speche,
For thy helping wole I eche,°
And eek encresen that I may.
But first I wol that thou obay
Fully, for thin avauntage,
Anoon to do me heer homage.
And sithe kiss thou shalt my mouthe,
Which to no vilain was never couthe°
For to aproche it, ne for to touche;
For sauff° of° cherlis I ne vouche°
That they shull never neigh it nere.
For curteis, and of fair manere,
Well taught, and full of gentilnesse
He muste ben, that shal me kisse,
And also of full high fraunchise,°
That shal attein to that emprise.°
 
¶“And first of o thing warne I thee,
That peine and gret adversitee
He mote endure, and eek travaile,
That shal me serve, withoute faile.
But ther ageins,° thee to comforte,
And with thy servise to desporte,
Thou mayst full glad and joyfull be
So good a maister to have as me,
And lord of so high renoun.
I bere of Love the gonfenoun,°
Of Curtesie the banere;
For I am of the silf° manere,
Gentil, curteis, meke and free;
That whosoever ententif be
Me to honoure, doute,° and serve,
And also that he him observe°
Fro trespasse and fro vilanie,
And him governe in curtesie
With will and with entencioun;
For whanne he first in my prisoun
Is caught, than muste he uttirly,
Fro thennesforth full bisily,
Caste him gentill for to be,
If he desire helpe of me.”
 
¶Anoon withouten more delay,
Withouten daunger° or affray,°
I bicome his man anoon,°
And gave him thankes many a oon,
And kneled doun with hondis joint,
And made it in my port° full queint;°
The joy went to min herte rote.
Whanne I had kissed his mouth so swote,°
I had sich mirthe and sich liking,
It cured me of languisshing.
He asked of me than hostages:—
I have,” he seid, “taken fele homages
Of oon and other, where I have bene
Disceived oft, withouten wene.°
These felouns,° full of falsite,
Have many sithes° biguiled me,
And through falshede hir lust° achieved,
Wherof I repente and am agreved.
And° I hem gete in my daungere,°
Hir falshed shull they bie° full dere.
But for I love thee, I sey° thee plein,°
I wole° of thee be more certein;
For thee so sore I wol now binde,
That thou away ne shalt not winde°
For to denien the covenaunt,
Or don that is not avenaunt.°
That thou were° fals it were gret reuthe,°
Sith thou semest so full of treuthe.”
 
¶“Sire, if thee list to undirstande,
I merveile thee asking this demande.
Forwhy° or wherfor shulde ye
Ostages or borwis° aske of me,
Or any other sikirnesse,°
Sith° ye wot,° in sothfastnesse,
That ye have me surprised° so,
And hol min herte taken me fro,
That it wol do for me nothing
But if it be at your bidding?
Min herte is yours, and min right nought,
As it bihoveth,° in dede and thought,
Redy in all to worch your will,
Whether so turn to good or ill.
So sore it lustith° you to plese,
No man therof may you desese.°
Ye have theron set sich° justise,°
That it is werreid° in many wise.
And if ye doute it nolde obeye,
Ye may therof do make° a keye,
And holde it with you for ostage.”
 
¶“Now certis, this is noon outrage,”°
Quod Love, “and fully I acorde;
For of the body he is full lorde
That hath the herte in his tresore;
Outrage it were° to asken more.”
 
¶Thanne of° his aumener° he drough
A litell key, fetis ynough,°
Which was of gold polisshed clere,
And seid to me, “With this key here
Thin hert to me now wole I shette;°
For al my jowelles° loke and knette°
I binde under this litel keye,
That no wight° may carie aweye;
This keye is ful of gret poeste.”°
With which anoon he touched me
Undir the side full softely,
That he min herte sodeinly
Without anoye° hadde spered,°
That yit right nought it hath me dered.°
 
¶Whanne he had doon his will al oute,°
And I had putte him out of doute,
Sire,” I seide, “I have right gret wille
Your lust and plesaunce to fulfille.
Lok ye my servise take at gree,°
By thilke° feith ye owe to me.
I seye nought for recreaundise,°
For I nought doute° of your servise.
But the servaunt traveileth in vaine,
That for to serven doth his paine
Unto that lord, which in no wise
Can him no thank for his servise.”
 
¶Love seid, “Dismaie thee nought,
Sin° thou for socour° hast me sought,
In thank thi servise wole I take,
And high of degree I wol thee make,
If wikkidnesse ne hindre thee;
But, as I hope, it shal nought be.
To worship° no wight by aventure°
May come, but if° he peine endure.
Abide and suffre thi distresse;
That hurtith now, it shal be lesse;
I wot° mysilf what may thee save,
What medicine thou woldist have.
And if thy trouth° to me thou kepe,
I shal unto thin helping eke,°
To cure thy woundes and make hem clene,
Wherso they be olde or grene;
Thou shalt be holpen, at wordis fewe.
For certeinly thou shalt well shewe
Wher that thou servest with good wille,
For to compleisshen° and fulfille
My comaundementis, day and night,
Whiche I to lovers yeve° of right.”
 
¶“Ah, sire, for goddis love,” seide I,
Er° ye pass hens, ententifly°
Your comaundementis to me ye say,
And I shall kepe hem, if I may;
For hem to kepen is al my thought.
And if so be I wote° hem nought,
Than may I sinne unwitingly.
Wherfore I pray you enterely,
With all min herte, me to lere,°
That I trespasse in no manere.”
 
¶The God of Love than charged me
Anoon, as ye shall here and see,
Word by word, by right emprise,°
So as the Romance shall devise.
 
¶The maister lesith his time to lere,°
Whan the disciple wol not here.°
It is but vein on him to swinke,
That on his lerning wol not thinke.
Whoso lust love, late him entende,°
For now the Romance° ginneth amende.°
Now is good to here, in fay,°
If ony be that can it say,
And pointe it° as the resoun is
Set; for othergate,° ywis,
It shall nought well in alle thing
Be brought to good undirstonding:
For a reder that pointith° ille°
A good sentence° may ofte spille.°
The book is good at the ending,
Maad of newe and lusty° thing;
For whoso wol the ending here,
The crafte° of love he shall now lere,°
If that he wol so long abide,
Til I this Romance may unhide,°
And undo° the signifiaunce
Of this dreme into romaunce.°
The sothfastness that now is hidde,
Without coverture shall be kidde,°
Whanne I undon have this dreming,
Wherin no worde is of lesing.°
 
¶“Villany,° at the biginning,
I wol,” say° Love, “over alle thing,
Thou leve,° if thou wolt not be
Fals, and trespasse ageines me.
I curse and blame generaly
All hem that loven vilanie;
For villany makith vilain,
And by his dedis a cherle is seyn.°
Thise vilains arn without pitee,
Frendshipe, love, and all bounte.°
I nil resseive to my servise
Hem that ben vilains of emprise.°
 
¶“But undirstonde in thin entent,
That this is not min entendement,°
To clepe° no wight in noo ages
Oonly gentill for his linages.°
But whoso is vertuous,
And in his port° nought outrageous,°
Whan sich oon thou seest thee biforn,
Though he be not gentill° born,
Thou maist well seyn, this is in soth,
That he is gentil, bicause he doth
As longeth to a gentilman;
Of hem noon other deme I can.
For certeinly, withouten drede,
A cherle is demed by his dede,
Of hie or lowe, as ye may see,
Or of what kinred° that he be.
Ne say nought, for noon ivel wille,
Thing that is to holden stille;°
It is no worship° to misseye.°
Thou maist ensample take of Keye,°
That was somtime, for misseying,°
Hated bothe of olde and yong;
As fer as Gawein,° the worthy,
Was preised for his curtesie,
Kay was hated, for he was fell,°
Of word dispitous° and cruell.
Wherfore be wise and aqueintable,°
Goodly of word, and resonable
Both to lesse and eek to more.
And whan thou comest ther men are,
Lok that thou have in custom ay
First to salue° hem, if thou may:
And if it fall,° that of hem somme
Salue thee first, be not domme,°
But quite° him curteisly anoon
Without abiding,° er they goon.
 
¶“For nothing° eek thy tunge applie
To speke wordis of ribaudie.°
To vilain speche in no degree
Lat never thi lippe unbounden be.
For I nought holde° him, in good feith,
Curteis, that foule wordis seith.
And alle wimmen serve and preise,
And to thy power hir honour reise.
And if that ony missaiere°
Dispise wimmen, that thou maist here,
Blame him, and bidde him holde him stille.
And set thy might and al thy wille
Wimmen and ladies for to please,
And to do thing that may hem ese,
That they ever speke good of thee,
For so thou maist best preised be.
 
¶“Lok fro pride thou kepe thee wele;
For thou maist both perceive and fele,
That pride is both foly and sinne;
And he that pride hath, him withinne,
Ne may his herte, in no wise,
Meken° ne souplen° to servise.
For pride is founde, in every part,
Contrarie unto Loves art.
And he that loveth trewely
Shulde him contene° jolily,
Withouten pride in sondry° wise,
And him disgisen in queintise.°
For queinte° array, withouten drede,
Is nothing proud, who takith hede;
For fresh array, as men may see,
Withouten pride may ofte be.
 
¶“Maintene thysilf aftir thy rent,°
Of robe and eek of garnement;
For many sithe° fair clothing

And if thou have nought, spend the lesse.
Alwey be mery, if thou may,

Thy nailes blak if thou mayst see,

And kembe thin heed right jolily.
Fard° not thy visage in no wise,
For that of love is not th’emprise;°
For love doth haten, as I finde,
A beaute that comth not of kinde.°
Alwey in herte I rede° thee
Glad and mery for to be,
And be as joyful as thou can;
Love hath no joye of sorowful man.
That ivel is ful of curtesie
That laughith in his maladie;
For ever of love the siknesse
Is meind° with swete and bitternesse.
The sore of love is merveilous;
For now the lover is joyous,
Now can he plein,° now can he grone,
Now can he singen, now maken mone.
Today he pleineth for hevinesse,
Tomorowe he pleyeth for jolynesse.
The lif of love is full contrarie,
Which stoundemele° can ofte varie.
But if thou canst som mirthis make,
That men in gree° wol gladly take,
Do it goodly, I comaunde thee;
For men shuld, whersoever they be,
Do thing that hem best sitting is,°
For therof comth good loos and pris.°
Wherof that thou be vertuous,
Ne be not straung ne daungerous.°
For if that thou good rider be,
Prike° gladly, that men may se.
In armes also if thou conne,°
Pursue, til thou a name hast wonne.
And if thy voice be fair and clere,
Thou shalt maken gret daungere°
Whan to sing they goodly preye;
It is thy worship for to obeye.
Also to you it longith ay
To harpe and gitern, daunce and play;
For if he can wel foote° and daunce,
It may him greetly do avaunce.
Among eek, for thy lady sake,
Songes and complaintes that thou make;
For that wol meven in hir herte,
Whan they reden of° thy smerte.°
Loke that no man for scarce° thee holde,°
For that may greve thee manifolde.
Resoun wol that a lover be
In his yiftes more large and free°
Than cherles that been not of loving.
For who therof can any thing,
He shal be leef° ay for to yeve,
In Loves lore who so wolde leve;°
For he that, through a sodein sight,
Or for a kissing, anonright°
Yaf hool his herte in will and thought,
And to him silf kepith right nought,
Aftir swich yift, is good resoun,
He yeve his good° in abandoun.°
 
¶“Now wol I shortly here reherce,
Of that that I have seid in verse,
Al the sentence° by and by,
In wordis fewe compendiously,°
That thou the bet mayst on hem thinke,
Whetherso it be thou wake or winke;
For that the wordis litel greve

¶“First I join° thee, here in penaunce,°
That ever, withoute repentaunce,
Thou set thy thought in thy loving,
To last° withoute repenting;
And thenke upon thy mirthis swete,
That shall folowe aftir whan ye mete.
 
¶“And for° thou trew to love shalt be,
I wole, and eek comaunde thee,
That in oo° place thou sette, all hoole,
Thin herte, withoute halfen doole,°
For° trecherie, and sikernesse;°
For I loved never doublenesse.°
To many his hert that° wol departe,°
Everich shal have but litel parte.
But of him drede I me right nought,
That in oo place settith his thought.
Therfore in oo place it sette,
And lat it never thennes flitte.°
For if thou yevest° it in lening,°
I holde° it but a wrecchid thing:
Therfore yeve it hoole and quite,°
And thou shalt have the more merite.
If it be lent, than aftir soone,
The bountee and the thank is doone;
But, in love, free yeven thing
Requirith a gret guerdoning.°
Yeve it in yift al quit fully,
And make thy yift debonairly;°
For men that yift wol hold more dere
That yeven is with gladsom chere.
That yift nought to preisen is
That man yeveth, maugre his.°
Whan thou hast yeven thin herte, as I
Have seid thee here al openly,
Thanne aventures° shull thee fall,°
Which harde and hevy been withall.
For oft whan thou bithenkist thee
Of thy loving, wherso thou be,
Fro folk thou must departe in hie,°
That noon perceive thy maladie,
But hide thin harm thou must alone,
And go forth sole,° and make thy mone.
Thou shalt no whil be in o state,
But whilom° colde and whilom hate;°
Now reed as rose, now yelowe and fade.°
Such sorowe, I trow,° thou never hade;
Cotidien,° ne yit quarteine,°
It is nat so ful of peine.
For often times it shal fal
In love, among thy peines al,
That thou thyselfe, al holy,°
Foryeten shalt so utterly,
That many times thou shalte be
Stil as an image of a tree,
Domme as a stoon, without stering°
Of fote or hond, without speking.
Than, soone after al thy paine,
To memorie shalt thou come ageine,
As man abasshed° wonder sore,
And after sighen more and more.
For wit° thou wel, withouten wene,°
In suche astat ful ofte have been
That have the ivel° of love assaide,°
Wherthrough thou arte so dismaide.
 
¶“After, a thought shal take thee so,
That thy love is to fer thee fro:
Thou shalt say, ‘God, what may this be,
That I ne may my lady se?
Min herte aloon is to her go,
And I abide al sole° in wo,
Departed° fro mine owne thought,
And with mine eyen se right nought.°
 
¶“ ‘Alas, mine eyen sende I ne may,
My careful° herte to convay!
Min hertes gide° but they be,
I praise nothing what ever they see.
Shul they abide thanne? nay;
But goon visite without delay
That min hert desireth so.
For certeinly, but if they go,
A fool myselfe I may wel holde,°
Whan I ne se what min hert wolde.
Wherfore I wol gone her to sene,
Or eased shal I never bene,
But° I have som tokening.’°
Then gost thou forth without dwelling;°
But oft thou failest of thy desire,
Er° thou mayst come her any nere,
And wastest in vain thy passage.
Than fallest thou in a newe rage;
For want of sight thou ginnest morne,
And homward pensif dost retorne.
In greet mischeef than shalt thou be,
For thanne again shall come to thee
Sighes and pleintes,° with newe wo,
That no itching prikketh° so.
Who wot it nought, he may go lere°
Of hem that bien love so dere.
 
¶“Nothing thin herte appesen may,
That° oft thou wolt goon and assay,
If thou mayst seen, by aventure,
Thy lives joy, thin hertis cure;
So that, by grace if thou might
Atteine of hir to have a sight,
Than shalt thou doon noon other dede
But with that sight thine eyen fede.
That faire fresh whan thou mayst see,
Thin herte shall so ravisshed be,
That never thou woldest, thy thankis,° lete,°
Ne remove, for to see that swete.
The more thou seest in sothfastnesse,
The more thou coveitest of that swetnesse;
The more thin herte brenneth in fire
The more thin herte is in desire
For who considreth everydell,
It may be likned wondir well,
The peine of love, unto a fere;°
For ever more thou neighest nere
Thou, or whoso that it be,
For verray sothe I tell it thee,
The hatter° ever shall thou brenne,
As experience shall thee kenne.°
Wherso thou comest in ony coost,°
Who is next° fire, he brenneth moost.
And yit forsoth, for all thin hete,
Though thou for love swelte° and swete,
Ne for nothing° thou felen may,
Thou shalt not willen to passe away.
And though thou go, yit must thee nede
Thenke alday on hir fairhede,°
Whom thou biheld with so good will;
And hold thysilf° bigiled° ill,
That thou ne haddest non hardement°
To shewe hir ought of thine entent.
Thin hert full sore thou wolt dispise,
And eek repreve of cowardise,
That thou, so dulle in every thing,
Were dom° for dred, without speking.
Thou shalt eek thenk thou didest folie,
That thou were hir so faste bye,
And durst not auntre° thee to say
Somthing, er thou cam away;
For thou haddist no more wonne,
To speke of hir whan thou bigonne:
But yif she wolde, for thy sake,
In armes goodly thee have take,
It shulde have be more worth to thee
Than of tresour greet plentee.
 
¶“Thus shalt thou morne and eek compleine,
And gete enchesoun° to goone ageine
Unto thy walke, or to thy place,
Where thou bihelde hir fleshly face.
And never, for fals suspeccioun,
Thou woldest finde occasioun
For to gone unto hir hous.
So art thou thanne desirous
A sight of hir for to have,
If thou thine honour mightest save,
Or any erand mightist make
Thider, for thy loves sake;
Ful fain thou woldist, but for drede
Thou gost not, lest that men tak hede.
Wherfore I rede,° in thy going,
And also in thine agein-coming,
Thou be wel war that men ne wite;°
Fein° thee other cause than itte
To go that weye, or faste° by;
To hele° wel is no folie.
And if so be it happe thee°
That thou thy love ther mayst see,
In siker wise° thou hir salewe,°
Wherwith thy colour° wol transmewe,°
And eke thy blood shal al toquake,°
Thin hewe eek chaungen for hir sake.
But word and wit, with cher° full pale,
Shull wante° for to tell thy tale.
And if thou mayst so ferforth winne,
That thou thy resoun° derst° biginne,
And woldist seyn three thingis or mo,
Thou shalt full scarsly seyn the two.
Though thou bithenk thee never so well,
Thou shalt foryete yit somdell,°
But if° thou del° with trecherie°
For false lovers mowe all folie
Seyn, what hem lust, withouten drede,
They be so double in hir falshede;
For they in hert cunne° thenke a thing
And seyn another, in hir speking.
And whan thy speche is endid all,
Right thus to thee it shal bifall;
If ony word than come to minde,
That thou to seye hast left bihinde,
Than thou shalt brenne° in greet martire;°
For thou shalt brenne as ony fire.
This is the strif and eek the affray,°
And the batell that lastith ay.
This bargein° end may never take,
But if that she thy pees will make.
 
¶“And whan the night is comen, anon
A thousand angres° shal come upon.
To bedde as fast thou wolt thee dight,°
Where thou shalt have but smal delit;
For whan thou wenest° for to slepe,
So full of peine shalt thou crepe,
Sterte° in thy bedde about ful wide,
And turn full ofte on every side;
Now dounward groff,° and now upright,°
And walowe in woo the longe night,
Thine armis shalt thou sprede abrede,
As man in werre were forweryede.°
Than shall thee° come a remembraunce
Of hir shappe and hir semblaunce,
Wherto none other may be pere.
And wit thou wel, withoute were,°
That thee shal seme somtime that night,
That thou hast hir, that is so bright,
Naked bitwene thine armes there,
All sothfastnesse° as though it were.
Thou shalt make castels thanne in Spaine,
And dreme of joye, all but in vaine,
And thee deliten of right nought,
Whil thou so slomrest in that thought,
That is so swete and delitable,
The which, in soth, nis but a fable,
For it ne shall no while laste.
Than shalt thou sighe and wepe faste,
And say, ‘Deer God, what thing is this?
My dreme is turned all amis,
Which was full swete and apparent,
But now I wake, it is al shent!°
Now yede° this mery thought away!
Twenty times upon a day

For it alleggith° well my pein.
It makith me full of joyfull thought,
It sleth° me, that it lastith noght.
A, lord! why nil ye me socoure,
The joye, I trow, that I langoure?
The deth I wold me shulde slo°
Whil I lie in hir armes two.
Min harm is hard, withouten wene,
My greet unese full ofte I mene.
But wolde Love do so° I might
Have fully joye of hir so bright,
My pein were quit° me richely.
Allas, to grete a thing aske I!
It is but foly, and wrong wening,
To aske so outrageous a thing.
And whoso askith folily,
He moot be warned hastily;
And I ne wot° what I may say,
I am so fer out of the way;
For I wold have full gret liking
And full gret joye of lasse thing.
For wold she, of hir gentilnesse,
Withouten more, me onis kesse,
It were to me a great guerdoun,°
Relees of all my passioun.
But it is hard to com therto;
All is but foly that I do,
So high I have min herte set,
Where I may no comforte get.
I noot wher° I sey wel or nought;
But this I wot wel in my thought,
That it were bet of hir aloon,
For to stint my wo and moon,
A loke on me ycast goodly,
Than for to have, al utterly,
Of another all hool the pley.°
A! lord! wher° I shall bide° the day
That ever she shall my lady be?
He is full cured that may hir see.
A! God! Whan shal the dawning spring?
To lie thus is an angry° thing;
I have no joy thus here to lie
Whan that my love is not me bie.
A man to lien hath gret disese,°
Which may not slep ne reste in ese.
I wolde it dawed, and were now day,
And that the night were went away;
For were it day, I wolde uprise.
A! slowe sonne, shew thin enprise!°
Speed thee to spred thy bemis bright,
And chace the derknesse of the night,
To putte away the stoundes° stronge,
Whiche in me lasten all to longe.’
¶“The night shalt thou contene° so,
Withoute rest, in peine and wo;
If ever thou knewe of love distresse,
Thou shalt mow° lerne in that siknesse.
And thus enduring shalt thou ly,
And rise on morwe up erly
Out of thy bedde, and harneis° thee
Er ever dawning thou mayst see.
All privily than shalt thou goon,
What weder it be, thysilf alloon,
For reine, or hail, for snow, for slete,
Thider she dwellith that is so swete,
The which may fall° aslepe be,
And thenkith but litel upon thee.
Than shalt thou goon, ful foule aferd;
Loke if the gate be unsperd,°
And wait without° in wo and peine,
Full ivel acoolde in winde and reine.
Than shal thou go the dore bifore,
If thou maist finde ony score,°
Or hole, or reeft,° what ever it were;
Than shalt thou stoupe, and lay to ere,
If they withinne aslepe be;
I mene, all save thy lady free.°
Whom waking if thou mayst aspie,
Go put thysilf in jupartie,°
To aske grace, and thee bimene,°
That she may wit,° withouten wene,°
That thou anight no rest hast hadde,
So sore for hir thou were bistadde.
Wommen wel ought pite to take
Of hem that sorwen for hir sake.
And loke, for love of that relike,°
That thou thenke non other like,
For whom thou hast so greet annoy,
Shall kiss thee er thou go away,
And holde° that in full gret deinte.°
And, for° that no man shal thee see
Bifore the hous, ne in the way,
Lok thou be goone agein er day.
Such coming, and such going,
Such hevinesse, and such walking,
Makith lovers, withouten wene,
Under hir clothes pale and lene,
For Love leveth colour ne cleernesse;
Who loveth trew hath no fatnesse.
Thou shalt wel by thyselfe see
That thou must nedis assaied° be.
For men that shape hem° other weye
Falsly her ladies to bitraye,
It is no wonder though they be fat;
With false othes hir loves they gat;
For ofte I see such losengeours°
Fatter than abbatis or priours.
 
¶“Yit with o thing I thee charge,
That is to sey, that thou be large°
Unto the maid that hir doth serve,
So best hir thank thou shalt deserve.
Yeve° hir yiftes, and get hir grace,
For so thou may hir thank purchace,
That she thee worthy holde and free,
Thy lady, and all that may thee see.
Also hir servauntes worshipe° ay,
And please as much as thou may;
Gret good through hem may come to thee,
Bicause with hir they been prive.
They shal hir telle hou they thee fande°
Curteis and wis, and well doande,°
And she shall preise well thee more.
Loke out of lond thou be not fore;°
And if such cause thou have, that thee

Leve hool thin herte in hostage,
Till thou agein make thy passage.
Thenk long to see the swete thing
That hath thin herte in hir keping.
 
¶“Now have I told thee, in what wise
A lover shall do me servise.
Do it thanne, if thou wolt have
The mede° that thou aftir crave.”
 
¶Whan Love all this had boden° me,
I seide him:—”Sire, how may it be
That lovers may in such manere
Endure the pein ye have seid here?
I merveile me wonder faste,°
How ony man may live or laste
In suche peine, and such brenning,
In sorwe and thought, and such sighing,
Aye unrelesed° woo to make,
Whether so it be they slepe or wake.
In such annoy continuely,
As help me God, this merveile I,
How man, but he were maad of stele,
Might live a month, such peines to fele.”
 
¶The God of Love than seide me,
“Freend, by the feith I owe to thee,
May no man have good, but he it by.°
A man loveth more tendirly
The thing that he hath bought most dere.
For wit thou well, withouten were,°
In thank that thing is taken more,
For which a man hath suffred sore.
Certis, no wo ne may atteine
Unto the sore of loves peine.
Non ivel therto ne may amounte,
No more than a man may counte
The dropes that of the water be.
For drye° as well the grete see
Thou mightist, as the harmes telle
Of hem that with Love dwelle
In servise; for peine hem sleeth,
And that ech man wold fle the deeth,
And trow they shulde never escape,
Nere that hope couthe hem make
Glad as man in prisoun sett,
And may not geten for to et°
But barly-breed, and watir pure,
And lieth in vermin and in ordure;
With alle this, yitt can he live,
Good hope such comfort hath him yive,
Which maketh wene° that he shall be
Delivered° and come to liberte;
In fortune is his fulle trust.
Though he lie in strawe or dust,
In hope is al his susteining.
And so for lovers, in hir wening,°
Which Love hath shitte° in his prisoun;
Good-Hope is hir salvacioun.
Good-Hope, how° sore° that they smerte,
Yeveth hem bothe will and herte
To profre hir body to martire;
For Hope so sore dothe hem desire
To suffre ech harm that men devise,
For joy that aftir shall arise.
 
¶“Hope in desire caccheth victorie;
In Hope, of love is all the glorie,
For Hope is all that love may yive;
Ner Hope, ther shuld no lover live.
Blessid be Hope, which with desire
Avaunceth lovers in such manere.
Good-Hope is curteis for to please,
To kepe lovers from all disese.°
Hope kepith his londe, and wole abide,
For ony perill that may betide;
For Hope to lovers, as most cheef,
Doth hem enduren all mischeef;
Hope is her help, whan mister° is.
And I shall yeve thee eek, ywis,
Three other thingis, that greet solas
Doth to hem that be in my las.°
 
¶“The firste good that may be founde,
To hem that in my lace be bounde,
Is Swete-Thought, for to recorde°
Thing wherwith thou canst accorde
Best in thin herte, wher° she be;
Thought in absence is good to thee.
Whanne ony lover doth compleine,
And liveth in distresse and peine,
Than° Swete-Thought shal come, as blive,°
Awey his angre° for to drive.
It makith lovers have remembraunce
Of comfort, and of high plesaunce,
That Hope hath hight° him for to winne.
For Thought anoon than shall biginne,
As fer, God wote, as he can finde,
To make a mirrour of his minde;
For to biholde he wol not lette.°
Hir persone he shall afore him sette,
Hir laughing eyen, persaunt° and clere,
Hir shappe, hir fourme, hir goodly chere,
Hir mouth that is so gracious,
So swete, and eek so saverous;°
Of all hir fetures he shall take heede,
His eyen with all hir limes° fede.
 
¶“Thus Swete-Thenking shall aswage
The peine of lovers, and hir rage.
Thy joy shall double, withoute gesse,°
Whan thou thenkist on hir semlinesse,°
Or of hir laughing, or of hir chere,
That to thee made thy lady dere.
This comfort wole I that thou take;
And if the next thou wolt forsake
Which is not lesse saverous,
Thou shuldist been to daungerous.°
 
¶“The secound shal be Swete-Speche,
That hath to many oon be leche,°
To bringe hem out of woo and were,°
And helpe many a bachilere;°
And many a lady sent socoure,
That have loved par-amour,
Through speking, whan they mighten here
Of hir lovers, to hem so dere.
To hem it voidith° al hir smerte,
The which is closed in hir herte.
In herte it makith hem glad and light,
Speche, whan they mowe have sight.
And therfore now it comth to minde,
In olde dawes,° as I finde,
That clerkis writen that hir knewe
Ther was a lady fresh of hewe,
Which of hir love made a songe
On him for to remembre amonge,°
In which she seid, ‘Whan that I here
Speken of him that is so dere,
To me it voidith alle smerte,
Ywis,° he sit so nere min herte.
To speke of him, at eve or morwe,
It cureth me of all my sorwe.
To me is noon so high plesaunce
As of his person daliaunce.’
She wist° full well that Swet-Speking
Comfortith in full much thing.
Hir love she had full well assaied,°
Of him she was full well apaied;°
To speke of him hir joy was set.
Therfore I reed° thee that thou get
A felow that can well concele
And kep thy counsell,° and well hele,°
To whom go shew hoolly thin herte,
Both wele and wo, joye and smerte:
To get comfort to him thou go,
And privily, bitween yow two,
Ye shall speke of that goodly thing,
That hath thin herte in hir keping;
Of hir beaute and hir semblaunce,
And of hir goodly countenaunce.
Of all thy state thou shalt him say,
And aske him counseill how thou may
Do ony thing that may hir plese;
For it to thee shall do gret ese,
That he may wit° thou trust him so,
Bothe of thy wele and of thi wo.
And if his hert to love be set,
His companie is much the bet,°
For resoun wole, he shew to thee
Al uttirly his privite;
And what she is he loveth so,
To thee pleinly he shal undo,°
Withoute drede of ony shame,
Both tell hir renoun and hir name.
Than shall he forther, ferre and nere,
And namely° to thi lady dere,
In siker° wise; ye, every other
Shall helpen as his owne brother,
In trouth withoute doublenesse,
And kepen cloos in sikernesse.
For it is noble thing, in fay,°
To have a man thou darste° say
Thy prive counsell every dell;°
For that wol comfort thee right well,
And thou shalt hold thee wel apaid,°
Whan such a freend thou hast assaied.°
 
¶“The thridde good of gret comfort
That yeveth° to lovers most disport,°
Comith of sight and biholding,
That clepid is Swete-Loking,
The whiche may noon ese do,
Whan thou art fer thy lady fro;
Wherfor thou prese° alwey to be
In place, wher thou mayst hir se.
For it is thing most amerous,
Most delitable and saverous,
For to aswage a mannes sorowe,
To sene his lady by the morowe.
For it is a full noble thing
Whan thine eyen have meting°
With that relike° precious,
Wherof they be so desirous.
But al day after, soth it is,
They have no dred to faren amis,
They dreden neither wind ne reine,
Ne yit non other maner peine.
For whan thine eyen were thus in blisse,
Yit of hir curtesie, ywisse,°
Alloon they can not have hir joye,
But to the hert they it convoye;°
Parte of hir bliss to him they sende,
Of all this harm to make an ende.
The eye is a good messangere,
Which can to the herte in such manere
Tidingis send, that he hath sene,
To voide him of his peines clene.
Wherof the hert rejoyseth so
That a gret partie of his wo
Is voided, and putte awey to flight.
Right as the derknesse of the night
Is chased with cleernesse of the mone,
Right so is al his woo full sone
Devoided clene, whan that the sight
Biholden may that fresshe wight°
That the hert desireth so,
That al his derknesse is ago;
For than the herte is al at ese,
Whan they seen that may hem plese.
 
¶“Now have I thee declared all oute,
Of that thou were in drede and doute
For I have told thee feithfully
What thee may curen utterly,
And alle lovers that wol be
Feithfull, and full of stabilite.
Good-Hope alwey kep by thy side,
And Swete-Thought make eke abide,
Swete-Loking and Swete-Speche;
Of all thin harmes they shall be leche.°
Of every° thou shalt have plesaunce;
If thou canst bide° in sufferaunce,°
And serve wel without feintise,°
Thou shalt be quite° of thine emprise,°
With more guerdoun,° if that thou live;
But al° this time this° I thee yive.”
 
¶The God of Love whanne al the day
Had taught me, as ye have herd say,
And enfourmed compendiously,°
He vanishide awey al sodeinly,
And I alloone lefte, al soole,
So full of compleint and of doole,
For I saw no man ther me by.
My wounds me greved wondirly;
Me for to curen nothing I knewe,
Save the bothon° bright of hewe,
Wheron was sett hoolly my thought;
Of other comfort knewe I nought,
But° it were through the God of Love;
I knew nat elles to my bihove°
That might me ease or comfort gete,
But if° he wolde him entermete.°
 
¶The roser° was, withoute doute,
Closed with an hegge withoute,
As ye toforn have herd me sayne;
And fast I bisiede,° and wolde fayne°
Have passed the haye,° if I might
Have geten in by ony slight°
Unto the bothon so fair to see.
But ever I dradde blamed to be,
If men wolde have suspeccioun
That I wolde of entencioun
Have stole the roses that ther were;
Therfore to entre I was in fere.
But at the last, as I bithought
Whether I shulde passe or nought,
I saw com with a gladde chere
To me, a lusty bachelere,°
Of good stature, and of good hight,
And Bialacoil° forsothe he hight.
Sone° he was to Curtesy,
And he me graunted full gladly
The passage of the outter hay,°
And seide:—“Sir, how that ye may
Passe, if it your wille be,
The fresshe roser for to see,
And ye the swete savour fele.
Your warrant° may I be right wele;
So thou thee kepe fro folie,
Shall no man do thee vilanie.
If I may helpe you in ought,
I shall not feine, dredeth nought;
For I am bound to your servise,
Fully devoide of feintise.”
Thanne unto Bialacoil saide I,
“I thank you, sir, full hertely,
And your biheste° take at gree,°
That ye so goodly profer me;
To you it comth of gret fraunchise,°
That ye me profer your servise.”
Than aftir, ful deliverly,°
Through the breres anoon wente I,
Wherof encombred was the hay°
I was wel plesed, the soth to say,
To see the bothon faire and swote,°
So fresshe sprange out of the rote.
 
¶And Bialacoil° me served well,
Whanne I so nigh me mighte fele
Of the bothon the swete odour,
And so lusty° hewed of colour.
But thanne a cherl (foule him bitide!)
Biside the roses gan him hide,
To kep the roses of that roser,
Of whom the name was Daunger.°
This cherl was hid there in the greves,°
Covered with gras and with leves,
To spie and tak° whom that he fonde
Unto that roser putte an honde.
He was not sole,° for ther was mo;
For with him were other two
Of wikkid maners, and ivel fame.°
That oon was clepid,° by his name,
Wikked-Tong, God yeve him sorwe!
For neither at eve, ne at morwe,
He can of no man goode speke;
On many a just man doth he wreke.°
Ther was a womman eek,° that hight°
Shame, that, who can reken right,
Trespace° was hir fadir name,
Hir moder Resoun; and thus was Shame
On live brought of these ilke two.
And yitt had Trespas never ado°
With Resoun, ne never ley hir bye,°
He was so hidous and ugly,
I mene, this that Trespas hight;
But Resoun conceiveth, of a sight,
Shame, of that I spake aforne.
And whan that Shame was thus borne,
It was ordeined, that Chastitee
Shulde of the roser lady be,
Which, of the bothons more and las,
With° sondry° folk assailed was,
That she ne wiste° what to do.
For Venus hir assailith so,
That night and day from hir she stal
Bothons and roses overall.
To Resoun than prayeth Chastitee,
Whom Venus flemed° over the see,
That she hir doughter° wolde hir lene,°
To kep the roser fresh and grene.
Anoon Resoun to Chastite
Is fully assented that it be,
And grauntide hir, at hir request,
That Shame, bicause she is honest,°
Shall keper of the roser be.
And thus to kepe it ther were three,
That noon shulde hardy° be ne bolde
(Were he yong, or were he olde)
Agein hir will awey to bere
Bothons ne roses, that ther were.
I had wel spedde,° hadde I not been
Awaited° with these three, and seen.
For Bialacoil, that was so faire,
So gracious and debonaire,
Quit him to me full curteisly,
And, me to plese, bad that I
Shuld draw me to the bothon nere;°
Prese in,° to touche the rosere
Which bar the roses, he yaf me leve;
This graunt ne might but litel greve.
And for he sawe it liked me,
Right nigh the bothon pullede he
A leef all grene, and yaff me that,
The which full nigh the bothon sat;
I made me of that leef full queinte.
And whanne I felte I was aqueinte
With Bialacoil, and so prive,
I wende all at my will had be.
Than waxe° I hardy for to tel
To Bialacoil how me befel.
Of Love, that toke and wounded me,
And seide: “Sir, so mote I thee,°
I may no joye have in no wise,
Upon no side, but it rise;°
For sithe (if I shall not feine)
In herte I have had so gret peine,
So gret annoy, and such affray,°
That I ne wot° what I shall say;
I dred your wrathe to disserve.°
Lever me were,° that knives kerve
My body shulde in pecis small,
Than in any wise it shulde fall
That ye wratthed shulde been with me.”
“Sey boldely thy will,” quod he,
“I nil be wroth, if that I may,
For nought that thou shalt to me say.”
 
¶Than seide I, “Sir, not you displese
To knowen of my greet unnese,
In which only love hath me brought;
For peines gret, disese and thought,
Fro day to day he doth me drie;°
Supposeth not, sir, that I lie.
In me five woundes dide he make,
The sore of whiche shall never slake°
But° ye the bothon graunte me,
Which is most passaunt of beaute,°
My lif, my deth, and my martire,
And tresour that I most desire.”
 
¶Than Bialacoil, affrayed° all,
Seide, “Sir, it may not fall;°
That ye desire, it may not arise.
What? wold ye shend° me in this wise?
A mochel foole thanne I were,
If I suffrid° you awey to bere
The fresh bothon, so faire of sight.
For it were neither skill° ne right
Of the roser ye broke the rinde,°
Or take the rose aforn° his kinde;°
Ye ar not courteis to aske it.
Late it still on the roser sit,
And grow til it amended° be,
And parfitly com to beaute.
I nold° not that it pulled° were
Fro the roser that it bere,°
To me it is so leef and dere.”
 
¶With that sterte out anoon Daungere,°
Out of the place where he was hidde.
His malice in his cheer° was kidde;°
Full grete he was, and blak of hewe,
Sturdy and hidous, whoso him knewe;
Like sharp urchouns° his heer was growe,
His eyes reed as the fire-glow;
His nose frounced° full kirked° stoode
He com criande as he were woode,°
And seid, “Bialacoil, tel me why
Thou bringest hider so boldly
Him that so nighe is the roser?
Thou worchist in a wrong maner;
He thenkith to dishonour thee,
Thou art wel worthy to have maugree°
To late him of the roser wite;°
Who serveth a feloun° is ivel quite.°
Thou woldist have doon gret bountee,°
And he with shame wold quit thee.
Flee hennes, felowe!° I red° thee go!
It wanteth litel I wol thee slo;°
For Bialacoil ne knew thee nought,
Whan thee to serve he sette his thought;
For thou wolt shame him, if thou might,
Bothe ageins resoun and right.
I wol no more in thee affie,°
That comest so slighly for t’espie;°
For it preveth wonder well,
Thy slight° and tresoun every dell.”
 
¶I durst° no more ther make abode,
For the cherl, he was so wode;
So gan he threten and manace,
And thurgh the haye° he did me chace.
For feer of him I tremblide and quoke,
So cherlishly° his heed he shoke;
And seide, if eft he might me take,
I shuld not from his hondis scape.
 
¶Than Bialacoil is fledde and mate,°
And I all sole, disconsolate,
Was left aloone in peine and thought;
For° shame, to deth I was nigh brought
Than thought I on min high foly,
How that my body, utterly,
Was yeve to peine and to martire;
And therto hadde I so gret ire,
That I ne durst the hayes passe;
Ther was non hope, there was no grace.
I trow° never man wiste° of peine,
But he were laced° in Loves cheine;
Ne no man wot and sooth it is,
But if° he love, what anger° is.
Love holdith his heest° to me right wele,
Whan peine he seide I shulde fele.
Non hert may thenk, ne tunge seyne,
A quarter of my wo and peine.
I might not with the anger° laste;°
Min herte in point was for to braste,
Whan I thought on the rose, that so
Was through Daunger cast me froo.
 
¶A long whil stood I in that state,
Til that me saugh so madde° and mate
The lady of the highe ward,°
Which from hir tour lokid thiderward.
Resoun men clepe that lady,
Which from hir tour deliverly°
Com doun to me withouten more.°
But she was neither yong, ne hore,°
Ne high ne low, ne fat ne lene,
But best, as it were in a mene.
Hir eyen two were cleer and light
As ony candel that brenneth° bright;
And on hir heed she hadde a crowne.
Hir semed wel an high persoune;
For rounde enviroun, hir crownet
Was full of riche stonis fret.°
Hir goodly semblaunt, by devis,°
I trow were maad in paradis;
For Nature had never such a grace,
To forge a werk of such compace.°
For certein, but° the letter lie,
God himsilf, that is so high,
Made hir aftir his image,
And yaff hir sith sich avauntage,
That she hath might and seignurie
To kepe men from al folie;
Whoso wole trowe° hir lore,°
Ne may offenden nevermore.
 
¶And while I stood thus derk and pale,
Resoun bigan to me hir tale;
She seide: “Al hail, my swete frende!
Foly and childhood wol thee shende,°
Which thee have put in gret affray;°
Thou hast bought deer the time of May,
That made thin hert mery to be.
In ivel time thou wentist to see
The gardin, wherof Idilnesse
Bar the keye, and was maistresse
Whan thou yedest° in the daunce
With hir, and haddest aqueintaunce:
Hir aqueintaunce is perilous,
First softe, and aftirward noyous;°
She hath thee trasshed,° withoute wene;
The God of Love had thee not seen,
Nadde° Idilnesse thee conveyed
In the verger° where Mirthe him pleyed.
If Foly have supprised° the,
Do so that it recovered be;
And be wel war to tak no more
Counsel, that greveth aftir sore;
He is wis that wole himsilf chastise.
And though a young man in ony wise
Trespace among,° and do foly,
Late him not tarie, but hastily
Late him amend what so be mis.
And eke I counseil thee, ywis,
The God of Love hoolly foryete,°
That hath thee in sich peine sette,
And thee in hert tormented so.
I can not seen how thou mayst go
Other° weyes to garisoun;°
For Daunger, that is so feloun,°
Felly° purposith thee to werrey,°
Which is ful cruel, the soth to sey.
 
¶“And yit of Daunger comth no blame,
In rewarde of° my doughter Shame,
Which hath the roses in hir warde,°
As she that may be no musarde.°
And Wikked-Tunge is with these two,
That suffrith° no man thider go;
For er a thing be do, he shall,
Wher that he cometh, overall,
In fourty places, if it be sought,
Sey thing that never was doon ne wrought;
So moche tresoun is in his male,°
Of falsness for to seyn a tale.
Thou delest with angry folk, ywis;
Wherfor to thee it bettir is
From these folk awey to fare,
For they wol make thee live in care.
This is the ivel° that Love they calle,
Wherin ther is but foly alle,
For love is foly everydell;°
Who loveth, in no wise may do well,
Ne sette his thought on no good werk.
His scole° he lesith, if he be clerk;°
Of other craft eke if he be,
He shal not thrive therin; for he
In love shal have more passioun°
Than monke, hermite, or chanoun.°
The peine is hard, out of mesure,
The joy may eek no while endure;
And in the possessioun
Is muche tribulacioun;
The joye it is so short-lasting,
And but in happe° is the geting;
For I see ther many in travaill,
That atte laste foule fail.
I was nothing° thy counseler,
Whan thou were maad the omager°
Of God of Love to° hastily;
Ther was no wisdom, but foly.
Thin hert was joly, but not sage,°
Whan thou were brought in sich a rage,
To yelde thee so redily,
And to Love, of his gret maistry.°
 
¶“I red° thee Love awey to drive,
That makith thee recch° not of thy live.
The foly more fro day to day
Shal grow, but° thou it putte away.
Take with thy teeth the bridel faste,
To daunt° thin herte; and eek thee caste,°
If that thou mayst, to get defence
For to redress thy first offence.
Whoso his herte alwey wol leve,°
Shal finde among° that shal him greve.”
 
¶Whan I hir herd thus me chastise,
I answerd in ful angry wise.
I prayed hir ceessen of hir speche,
Outher° to chastise me or teche,
To bidde me my thought refreine,°
Which Love hath caught in his demeine:°—
What? wene ye° Love wol consent,
That me assailith with bowe bent,
To draw min herte out of his honde,
Which is so quikly° in his bonde?
That° ye counsail, may never be;
For whanne he first arested° me,
He took min herte so hoole him tille,°
That it is nothing at my wille;
He taughte it so him for to obey,
That he it sparred° with a key.
I pray yow lat me be all stille.
For ye may well, if that ye wille,
Your wordis waste in idilnesse;
For utterly, withouten gesse,°
All that ye seyn is but in veine.
Me were lever° die in the peine,°
Than Love to me-ward shulde arette°
Falsheed, or tresoun on me sette.
I wol me gete pris or blame,
And love trew, to save my name;
Who me chastisith, I him hate.”
 
¶With that word Resoun wente hir gate,°
Whan she saugh for no sermoning
She might me fro my foly bring.
Than dismayed, I lefte° all sool,°
Forwery,° forwandred° as a fool,
For I ne knew no chevisaunce.°
Than fell into my remembraunce,
How Love bad me to purveye°
A felow, to whom I mighte seye
My counsell and my privete,
For that shuld moche availe me.
With that bithought I me, that I
Hadde a felow faste by,
Trewe and siker, curteis, and hende,°
And he was called by name a Freende;
A trewer felow was nowher noon.
In haste to him I wente anoon,
And to him all my woo I tolde,
Fro him right nought I wold withholde.
I tolde him al withoute were,°
And made my compleint on Daungere,
How for to see he was hidous,
And to-me-ward contrarious;
The whiche through his cruelte
Was in point to have meigned° me;
With Bialacoil° whanne he me sey°
Within the gardin walke and pley,
Fro me he made him for to go,
And I bilefte aloon in wo;
I durst no lenger with him speke,
For Daunger seide he wold be wreke,°
Whan that he sawe how I wente
The fresshe bothon for to hente,°
If I were hardy to come neer
Bitween the hay° and the roser.°
 
¶This freend, whanne he wiste of my thought,
He discomforted me right nought,
But seid, “Felow be not so madde,
Ne so abaisshed° nor bistadde.°
Mysilf I know full well Daungere,
And how he is feers° of his chere,
At prime temps,° Love to manace;°
Ful ofte I have ben in his caas.
A feloun° first° though that he be,
Aftir thou shalt him souple° see.
Of longe passed I knew him wele;
Ungoodly first though men him fele,
He wol meek aftir, in his bering,
Been, for service and obeisshing.
I shal thee tell what thou shalt do.—
Mekely I rede thou go him to,
Of herte pray him specialy
Of thy trespace to have mercy,
And hote° him well, him here to plese,
That thou shalt nevermore him displese.
Who can best serve of flatery,
Shall plese Daunger most uttirly.”
 
¶My freend hath seid to me so wel,
That he me esid hath somdell,
And eke allegged° of my torment;
For through him had I hardement°
Again to Daunger for to go,
To preve if I might meke him° so.
 
¶To Daunger cam I, all ashamed,
The which aforn me hadde blamed,
Desiring for to pese° my wo;
But over hegge durst I not go,
For he forbad me the passage.
I fonde him cruel in his rage,
And in his honde a gret burdoun.°
To him I knelid lowe adoun,
Ful meke of port,° and simple of chere,
And seid, “Sir, I am comen here
Only to aske of you mercy.
That greveth me full gretly
That ever my lif I wratthed° you,
But for to amende I am com now,
With all my might, both loude and stille,
To doon right at youre owne wille;
For Love made me for to do
That I have trespassed hidirto;°
Fro whom I ne may withdraw min herte;
Yit shall I never, for joy ne smerte,°
What so bifalle, good or ille,
Offende more agein your wille.
Lever° I have endure disese°
Than do that shulde you displese.
 
¶“I you require° and pray, that ye
Of me have mercy and pitee,
To stint° your ire that greveth so,
That I wol swere for evermo
To be redressid° at your liking,
If I trespasse in ony thing;
Save that I pray thee graunte me
A thing that may nat warned° be,
That I may love, all onely;°
Non other thing of you aske I.
I shall doon elles well, ywis,
If of your grace ye graunt me this.
And ye ne may not letten° me,
For wel wot ye that love is free,
And I shall loven, sith that I wille,
Whoever like it° well or ille;
And yit ne wold I, for al Fraunce,
Do thing to do you displesaunce.”
 
¶Than Daunger fille in his entent
For to foryeve° his maltalent;°
But all his wratthe yit at laste
He hath relesed,° I preid so faste:°
Shortly he seide, “Thy request
Is not to mochel dishonest;°
Ne I wol not werne° it thee,
For yit nothing engreveth° me.
For though thou love thus evermore,
To me is neither soft ne sore.
Love wher thee list; what recchith me,°
So° thou fer° fro my roses be?
Trust not on me, for noon assay,°
In ony time to pass the hay.”
Thus hath he graunted my prayere.
Than wente I forth, withouten were,°
Unto my freend, and tolde him all,
Which° was right joyful of my tale.
He seid, “Now goth wel thin affaire,
He shall to thee be debonaire.°
Though he aforn was dispitous,°
He shall heeraftir be gracious.
If he were touchid on som good veine,
He shuld yit rewen° on thy peine.
Suffire, I rede, and no boost make,
Till thou at good mes° mayst him take.
By suffraunce,° and by wordis softe,
A man may overcomen ofte
Him that aforn he hadde in drede,
In bookis sothly as I rede.”
 
¶Thus hath my freend with gret comfort
Avaunced me with high disport,°
Which wold me good as mich as I.
And thanne anoon full sodeinly
I took my leve, and streight I went
Unto the hay; for gret talent°
I had to seen the fresh bothon,
Wherin lay my salvacioun;
And Daunger took kepe,° if that I
Kepe him covenaunt° trewly.
So sore I dradde his manasing,°
I durst not breken his bidding;
For, lest that I were of him shent,°
I brak not his comaundement,
For to purchase his good wille.
It was hard for to come thertille,
His mercy was to° fer bihinde;
I wept, for I ne might it finde.
I compleined and sighed sore,
And languisshed evermore,
For I durst not over go
Unto the rose I loved so.
Throughout my deming° outerly,°
Than had he knowlege certeinly,
That Love me ladde in sich a wise,
That in me ther was no feintise,°
Falsheed, ne no trecherie.
And yit he, full of vilanie,
Of disdeine, and cruelte,
On me ne wolde have pite,
His cruel will for to refreine,°
Though I wepe alwey, and compleine.
 
¶And while I was in this torment,
Were come of grace, by God sent,
Fraunchise,° and with hir Pite
Fulfild the bothon of bounte.°
They go to Daunger anoonright
To forther me with alle hir might,
And helpe in worde and in dede,
For well they saugh that it was nede.
First, of hir grace, dame Fraunchise
Hath taken word of this emprise:
She seid, “Daunger, gret wrong ye do
To worch this man so moche wo,
Or pinen° him so angerly;°
It is to you gret vilany.
I can not see why, ne how,
That he hath trespassed agein you,
Save that he loveth; wherfor ye shulde
The more in cherete° of him holde.
The force of love makith him do this;
Who wolde him blame he dide° amis?
He leseth more than ye may do;
His peyne is hard, ye may see, lo!
And Love in no wise wold consente
That he have power to repente;
For though that quik° ye wolde him slo,°
Fro Love his herte may not go.
Now, swete sir, is it youre ese
Him for to angre or disese?
Allas, what may it you avaunce
To doon to him so gret grevaunce?
What worship is it again him take,
Or on your man° a werre make,
Sith he so lowly every wise
Is redy, as ye lust° devise?
If Love hath caught him in his lace,
You for to beye° in every caas,
And been your suget at your will
Shuld ye therfore willen him ill?
Ye shulde him spare more, all out,
Than him that is both proude and stout.
Curtesie wol that ye socour
Hem that ben meke undir your cure.°
His herte is hard, that° wol not meke,°
Whan men of mekenesse him biseke.”
 
¶“That is certeine,” seid Pite;
We see oft that humilitee
Bothe ire, and also felonie°
Venquissheth, and also melancolie;
To stonde forth° in such duresse,
This crueltee and wikkednesse.
Wherfore I pray you, sir Daungere,
For to maintene no lenger here
Such cruel werre again your man,
As hoolly youres as ever he can;
Nor that ye worchen no more wo
On this caitif° that languisshith so,
Which wol no more to you trespasse,
But putte him hoolly in your grace.
His offense ne was but lite;
The God of Love it was to wite,°
That he your thrall so gretly is,
And if ye harme him, ye done amis;
For he hath had full hard penaunce,
Sith that ye refte° him th’aqueintaunce°
Of Bialacoil, his moste joye,
Which alle his peines might acoye.°
He was biforn anoyed sore,
But than ye doubled him well more;
For he of blis hath ben full bare,
Sith Bialacoil was fro him fare.
Love hath to him do gret distresse,
He hath no nede of more duresse.
Voideth from him youre ire, I rede;°
Ye may not winnen in this dede.
Makith Bialacoil repeire° agein,
And haveth pite upon his pein;
For Fraunchise wole, and I, Pite,
That merciful to him ye be;
And sith that she and I accorde,
Have upon him misericorde;°
For I you pray, and eek moneste,°
Nought to refusen our requeste;
For he is hard and fell° of thought,
That for us two wol do right nought.”
 
¶Daunger ne might no more endure,
He mekede him unto mesure.°
 
¶“I wole in no wise,” seith Daungere,
“Deny that ye have asked here;
It were to gret uncurtesie.
I wol ye have the companie
Of Bialacoil, as ye devise;
I wole him letten° in no wise.”
 
¶To Bialacoil than wente in hy°
Fraunchise, and seid full curteisly:—
Ye have to longe be deignous°
Unto this lover, and daungerous,
Fro him to withdraw your presence,
Whiche hath do to him great offence,
That ye not wolde upon him see;
Wherfore a sorouful man is he.
Shape ye° to paye° him, and to please,
Of my love if ye wol have ease.
Fulfil his wil, sith that ye knowe
Daunger is daunted° and brought lowe
Through helpe of me and of Pite;
You thar° no more aferde be.”
 
¶“I shal do right as ye wil,”
Saith Bialacoil, “for it is skil,°
Sith Daunger wol that it so be.”
Than Fraunchise hath him sent to me.
 
¶Bialacoil at the biginning
Salued me in his comming.
No straungeness was in him sene,
No more than he ne had wrathed bene.°
As fair semblaunt than shewed he me,
And goodly, as aforn did he;
And by the hond, withouten doute,
Within the hay, right al aboute
He ladde me, with right good chere,
Al environ the vergere,°
That Daunger had me chased fro.
Now have I leve overal to go;
Now am I raised, at my devis,°
Fro hell unto paradis.
Thus Bialacoil, of gentilnesse,
With alle his paine and besinesse,
Hath shewed me, only of grace,
The estres° of the swote° place.
 
¶I saw the rose, whan I was nigh,
Was gretter woxen, and more high,
Fresshe, rody,° and fair of hewe,
Of coloure ever iliche newe.°
And whan I hadde it longe seen,°
I saw that through the leves grene
The rose spred to spaunishinge;°
To sene it was a goodly thinge.
But it ne was so sprede on brede,°
That men within might know° the sede;
For it covert was and enclose
Both with the leves and with the rose.
The stalk was even and grene upright,
It was theron a goodly sight;
And wel the better, withouten wene,°
For the seed was not ysene.
Ful faire it spradde, God it blesse!
For suche another, as I gesse,
Aforn ne was, ne more vermaile.°
I was abawed° for merveile,
For ever, the fairer that it was,
The more I am bounden in Loves laas.
 
¶Longe I abod there, soth to saye,
Til Bialacoil I gan to praye,
Whan that I sawe him in no wise
To me warnen° his servise,
That he me wolde graunt a thinge,
Which to remembre is wel sittinge;°
This is to sayn, that of his grace
He wold me yeve° leiser° and space
To me that was so desirous
To have a kissing° precious
Of the goodly freshe rose,
That sweetly smelleth in my nose;
For if it you displesed nought,
I wolde gladly, as I sought,
Have a cosse° therof freely
Of your yeft;° for certainly
I wol none have but by your leve,
So loth me were you for to greve.”
 
¶He saide, “Frend, so God me spede,
Of Chastite I have such drede,
Thou shuldest not warned° be for me,°
But I dar not, for Chastite.
Againe hir dare I not misdo,
For alwey biddeth she me so
To yeve no lover leve to kisse;
For who therto may winnen, ywis,
He of the surplus of the praye°
May live in hope to get som daye
For who so kissing maye attaine,
Of loves peine hath, soth to sayne,
The best and most avenaunt,°
“And ernest° of the remenaunt.”
 
¶Of his answere I sighed sore;
I durst assaye him tho no more,
I had such dred to greve him ay.
A man shuld not to muche assaye
To chafe° his frend out of mesure,
Nor putte his lif in aventure;°
For no man at the firste stroke
Ne may nat felle downe an oke;°
Nor of the reisins° have the wine,
Til grapes ripe° and wel afine°
Be sore empressid,° I you ensure,
And drawen out of the pressure.°
But I, forpeined° wonder stronge,
Thought that I abood right longe
Aftir° the kis, in peine and wo,
Sith I to kis desired so:
Til that, rewing on my distresse,
Ther to me Venus the goddesse,
Which ay werreyeth° Chastite,
Came of hir grace, to socour me,
Whos might is knowe fer and wide,
For she is modir of Cupide,
The God of Love, blinde as stoon,°
That helpith lovers many oon.
This lady brought in hir right hond
Of brenning° fire a blasing brond;°
Wherof the flawme and hoote fire
Hath many a lady in desire
Of love brought, and sore hette,°
And in hir servise hir hertes sette.
This lady was of good entaile,°
Right wondirfull of apparaile;
By hir atire so bright and shene,
Men might perceive well, and seen,
She was not of religioun.°
Nor I nil make mencioun
Nor of hir robe, nor of tresour,°
Of broche, nor of hir riche attour;°
Ne of hir girdill° aboute hir side,
For that I nill not longe abide.
But knowith wel, that certeinly
She was araied richely.
Devoide of pride certein she was;
To Bialacoil she wente a pas,
And to him shortly, in a clause,
She seide: “Sir, what is the cause
Ye been of port so daungerous
Unto this lover, and deinous,°
To graunte him nothing but a kisse?
To worne° it him ye done amisse;
Sith well ye wote,° how that he
Is Loves servaunt, as ye may see,
And hath beaute, wherthrough he is
Worthy of love to have the blis.
How he is seemly, biholde and see,
How he is fair, how he is free,
How he is swoote and debonair,°
Of age yong, lusty,° and fair.
Ther is no lady so hawteine,°
Duchess, countess, ne chasteleine,°
That I nold holde° hir ungoodly°
For to refuse him outterly.
His breth is also good and swete,
And eke his lippis rody, and mete°
Oonly to pleyen, and to kisse.
Graunte him a kis, of gentilnesse!
His teth arn also white and clene;
Me thinkith wrong, withouten wene,
If ye now worne him, trustith me,
To graunte that a kis have he;
The lass to helpe him that ye haste,
The more time shul ye waste.”
 
¶Whan the flawme of the verry bronde,
That Venus brought in hir right honde,
Had Bialacoil with hete smete,°
Anoon he bad, withouten lette,°
Graunt to me the rose kisse.
Thanne of my peine I gan to lisse,°
And to the rose anoon wente I,
And kisside it full feithfully.
Thar no man aske if I was blithe,°
Whan the savour soft and lithe°
Strook to min hert withoute more,
And me alegged° of my sore,
So was I full of joye and blisse.
It is fair sich a flour to kisse,
It was so swoote and saverous.
I might not be so angwisshous,
That I mot glad and joly be,
Whan that I remembre me.
Yit ever among,° sothly to seyne,
I suffre noye° and moche peine.
 
¶The see may never be so still,
That with a litel winde it nil
Overwhelme and turne also,
As it were woode,° in wawis° go.
Aftir the calm the trouble soon
Mot folowe, and chaunge as the moon.
Right so farith Love, that selde in oon°
Holdith his anker; for right anoon
Whan they in ese wene° best to live,
They ben with tempest all fordrive.
Who serveth Love, can telle of wo;
The stoundemele° joy mote overgo.
Now he hurteth, and now he cureth,
For selde in oo point Love endureth.
 
¶Now is it right me to procede,
How Shame gan medle and take hede,
Thurgh whom felle° angres I have had;
And how the stronge wal was maad,
And the castell of brede and lengthe,
That God of Love wan° with his strengthe.
All this in romance will I sette,
And for nothing ne will I lette,°
So that it liking to hir be,
That is the flour of beaute;
For she may best my labour quite,°
That I for hir love shal endite.
 
¶Wikkid-Tung, that the covine°
Of every lover can devine°
Worste,° and addith more somdell,
(For Wikkid-Tung seith never well),
To me-ward bare he right gret hate,
Espying me erly and late,
Till he hath seen the grete chere°
Of Bialacoil and me yfeere.°
He mighte not his tung withstonde
Wors to reporte than he fonde,
He was so full of cursed rage;
It satte him well of his linage,°
For him an Irish womman bare.°
His tung was filed sharpe, and squar,°
Poignaunt° and right kerving,°
And wonder bitter in speking.
For whan that he me gan espie,
He swoore, afferming sikirlie,°
Bitween Bialacoil and me
Was ivel aquaintaunce and prive.°
He spak therof so folilie,°
That he awakid Jelousie;
Which, all afraied° in his rising,
Whanne that he herd Jangling,°
He ran anoon, as he were woode,
To Bialacoil ther that he stode;
Which° hadde lever° in this caas
Have been at Reines° or Amyas;°
For foot-hoot,° in his felonie°
To him thus seide Jelousie:—
Why hast thou been so necligent,
To kepen, whanne I was absent,
This verger heer left in thy warde?°
To me thou haddist no rewarde,°
To truste (to thy confusioun)
Him thus, to whom suspeccioun
I have right greet, for it is nede;
It is well shewed by the dede.
Great faute in thee now have I founde;
By God, anoon thou shalt be bounde,
And faste loken in a tour,°
Withoute refuit° or socour.
For Shame to long hath be thee froo;
Over° soon she was agoo.
Whan thou hast lost both drede and feere,
It semed wel she was not heere.
She was not bisy, in no wise,
To kepe thee and to chastise,
And for to helpen Chastitee
To keep the roser, as thenkith me.
For than this boy knave so boldly
Ne sholde not have be hardy,
Ne in this verger had such game,
Which now me turneth to gret shame.”
 
¶Bialacoil nist° what to sey;
Full fain he wolde have fled awey,
For fear han hidde, nere° that he°
Al sodeinly toke° him with me.
And whanne I saugh he hadde soo,
This Jelousie, take us twoo,
I was astoned,° and knew no rede,°
But fledde awey for verrey drede.
 
¶Than Shame cam forth full simply;
She wende° have trespaced full gretly;
Humble of hir port, and made it simple,
Wering a vaile in stide of wimple,°
As nonnis doon in her abbey.
Bicause hir hert was in affray,°
She gan to speke, within a throwe,°
To Jelousie, right wonder lowe.
First of his grace she bisought,
And seide:—“Sire, ne leveth° nought
Wikkid-Tung, that fals espie,
Which is so glad to feine and lie.
He hath you maad, thurgh flatering,
On Bialacoil a fals lesing.°
His falsnesse is not now anewe,
It is to long that he him knewe.
This is not the firste day;
For Wikkid-Tunge hath custom ay
Yonge folkis to bewreie,°
And false lesinges° on hem lie.°
 
¶“Yit nevertheles I see amonge,
That the loigne° it is so longe
Of Bialacoil, hertis to lure,
In Loves servise for to endure,
Drawing suche folk him too,
That he hath nothing with to doo;°
But in sothnesse I trowe° nought,
That Bialacoil hadde ever in thought
To do trespace or vilonie;°
But, for° his modir Curtesie
Hath taught him ever for to be
Good of aqueintaunce and prive;°
For he loveth noon hevinesse,
But mirthe and pley, and all gladnesse;
He hateth alle trecherous,°
Solein° folk and envious;
For wel ye witen° how that he
Wol ever glad and joyfull be
Honestly° with folk to pleye.
I have be negligent, in good feye,°
To chastise him; therfor now I
Of herte cry you heer mercy,
That I have been so recheles°
To tamen° him, withouten lees.°
Of my foly I me repente;
Now wole I hool set min entente
To kepe, bothe loude and stille,°
Bialacoil° to do your wille.”
 
¶“Shame, Shame,” said Jelousy,
“To be bitrasshed° gret drede have I.
Lecherie hath clomb° so hye,
That almost blered° is min ye;
No wonder is, if drede have I.
Over-all regnith Lechery,
Whos might yit growith night and day.
Bothe in cloistre and in abbey
Chastite is werried° overall.
Therfore I wol with siker° wall
Close both roses and roser.
I have to longe in this maner
Left hem unclosid wilfully;°
Wherfore I am right inwardly
Sorowfull and repente me.
But now they shall no lenger be
Unclosid; and yit I drede sore,
I shall repente ferthermore,
For the game goth all amis.
Counsell I must newe, ywis.
I have to longe tristed thee,
But now it shal no lenger be;
For he may best, in every cost,°
Disceive, that men tristen most.
I see wel that I am nigh shent,°
But if I set my ful entent
Remedie to purveye.
Therfore close I shall the weye
Fro hem that wol the rose espie,
And com to wait me° vilonie,°
For, in good feith and in trouthe,
I wol not lette,° for no slouthe,
To live the more in sikirnesse,°
To make anoon a forteresse,
To enclose the roses of good savour.
In middis shall I make a tour
To putte Bialacoil in prisoun,
For ever I dred me of tresoun.
I trowe I shal him kepe soo,
That he shal have no might to goo
About to make companie
To hem that thenke of vilanie;
Ne to no such as hath ben here
Aforn, and founde in him good chere,
Which han assailed him to shende,
And with hir trowandise° to blende.°
A fool is eith° for to bigile;
But may I live a litel while,
He shal forthenke° his fair semblaunt.”
 
¶And with that word cam Drede° avaunt,°
Which was abasshed,° and in gret fere,
Whanne he wist° Jelousie was there.
He was for drede in such affray,
That not a worde durste he say,
But quaking stood full stille aloone,
Til Jelousie his wey was gone,
Save Shame, that him not forsoke;
Both Drede and she ful sore quoke;°
Til that at laste Drede abreide,°
And to his cosin Shame seide:
“Shame,” he seide, “in sothfastnesse,
To me it is gret hevinesse,
That the noise so ferre is go,
And the sclaundre of us two.
But sith that it is so bifall,
We may it not ageine° calle,
Whanne onis° sprongen is a fame.°
For many a yeer withouten blame
We han been, and many a day;
For many an Aprill and many a May
We han ypassed, not ashamed,
Till Jelousie hath us blamed
Of mistrust and suspecioun
Causeles, withouten enchesoun.°
Go we to Daunger hastily,
And late us shew him openly,
That he hath not aright ywrought,°
Whan that he sette nought his thought
To kepe better the purprise;°
In his doing he is not wise.
He hath to us ydo gret wronge,
That hath suffred now so longe
Bialacoil to have his wille,
All his lustes to fulfille.
He must amende it utterly,
Or ellis shall he vilainsly°
Exiled be out of this londe;
For he the werre may not withstonde
Of Jelousie, nor the greef,
Sith Bialacoil is at mischeef.”°
 
¶To Daunger, Shame and Drede anoon
The righte weye ben agoon.
The cherl° they founden hem aforn
Ligging undir an hawethorn.
Undir his heed no pilowe was,
But in the stede a trusse° of gras.
He slombred, and a nappe he toke,
Til Shame pitously him shoke,
And great manace on him gan make.
Why slepist thou whan thou shuld wake?”
Quod Shame; “Thou dost us vilanie!
Who tristith thee, he doth folie,
To kepe roses or bothons,
Whan they ben faire in hir sesons.
Thou art wox to° familiere
Wher thou shuld be straunge° of chere,
Stoute of thy port, redy to greve.
Thou dost gret foly for to leve
Bialacoil herein, to calle
The yonder man to shenden us alle.
Though that thou slepe, we may here
Of Jelousie gret noise here.
Art thou now late? rise up in hy,°
And stoppe° sone and deliverly°
All the gappis of the hay;
Do no favour, I thee pray.
It fallith nothing to thy name.
Make° fair semblaunt, wher thou maist blame.
 
¶“If Bialacoil be sweete and free,
Dogged° and fell° thou shuldist be;
Froward° and outragious,° ywis;
A cherl chaungeth that curteis is.
This have I herd ofte in seying,
That man ne may, for no daunting,°
Make a sperhauke of a bosarde.°
All men wol hold thee for musarde,°
That debonair have founden thee,
It sit° thee nought curteis to be;
To do men plesaunce or servise,
In thee it is recreaundise.°
Let thy werkis, fer and nere,
Be like thy name, which is Daungere.”°
 
¶Thanne, all abawid° in shewing,
Anoon spak Dreed, right thus seying,
And seid, “Daunger, I drede me
That thou ne wolt not bisy be
To kepe that thou hast to kepe;
Whan thou shuldist wake, thou art aslepe.
Thou shalt be greved certeinly,
If thee aspie Jelousy,
Or if he finde thee in blame.
He hath today assailed Shame,
And chased awey, with gret manace,
Bialacoil oute of this place,
And swereth shortly that he shall
Enclose him in a sturdy wall;
And all is for thy wikkednesse,
For that thee faileth straungenesse.
Thin herte, I trow, be failed al;
Thou shalt repente in speciall,
If Jelousie the sothe knewe;
Thou shalt forthenke,° and sore rewe.”°
 
¶With that the cherl his club gan shake,
Frouning° his eyen gan to make,
And hidous chere; as man in rage,
For ire he brente in his visage.
Whan that he herd him blamed soo,
He seide, “Out of my witte I goo;
To be discomfit I have gret wronge.
Certis, I have now lived to longe,
Sith I may not this closer° kepe;
All quik° I wold be dolven° depe,
If ony man shal more repeire
Into this gardin, for foule or faire.
Mine hert for ire goth afere,°
That I lete ony entre here.
I have do folie, now I see,
But now it shall amended be.
Who settith foot here any more,
Truly, he shall repente it sore;
For no man mo into this place
Of me to entre shal have grace.
Lever I had, with swerdis tweine,
Thurghout mine herte, in every veine
Perced to be, with many a wounde,
Than slouthe shulde in me be founde.
From hennesforth, by night or day,
I shall defende it, if I may,
Withouten ony excepcioun
Of ech maner condicioun;
And if I eny man it graunte,
Holdeth me for recreaunte.”°
 
¶Than Daunger on his feet gan stonde,
And hente a burdoun° in his honde.
Wroth in his ire, ne lefte° he nought,
But thurgh the verger he hath sought.
If he might finde hole or trace,
Wherthurgh that men mot forthby pace,
Or any gappe, he dide it close,
That no man mighte touche a rose
Of the roser all aboute;
He shitteth° every man withoute.
 
¶Thus day by day Daunger is wers,
More wondirfull and more divers,
And feller° eek than ever he was;
For him full ofte I singe “Allas!”
For I ne may nought, thurgh his ire,
Recover that I moost desire.
Min herte, allas, wol brest° atwoo,
For° Bialacoil I wratthed soo.
For certinly, in every membre
I quake, whan I me remembre
Of the bothon, which that I wolde
Full ofte a day sene and biholde.
And whanne I thenke upon the kisse,
And how muche joye and blisse
I hadde thurgh the savour swete,
For wante° of it I grone and grete.°
Me thenkith I fele yit in my nose
The swete savour of the rose.
And now° I woot° that I mot goo
So fer the fresshe floures froo,
To me full welcom were the deeth;
Absens therof, allas, me sleeth!
For whilom° with this rose, allas,
I touched nose, mouth, and face;
But now the deth I must abide.°
But Love consente,° another tide,
That onis° I touche may and kisse,
I trow my peine shal never lisse.°
Theron is all my coveitise,°
Which brent min herte in many wise.
Now shal repaire° again sighinge,
Long wacche on nightis, and no slepinge;
Thought in wisshing, torment, and woo,
With many a turning to and froo,
That half my peine I can not telle.
For I am fallen into helle
From paradis and welth,° the more
My turment greveth; more and more
Anoieth now the bittirnesse,
That I toforn have felt swetnesse.
And Wikkid-Tunge, thurgh his falshede,
Causeth all my woo and drede.
On me he leyeth a pitous° charge,°
Bicause his tunge was to large.°
 
¶Now it is time, shortly that I
Tell you somthing of Jelousy,
That was in gret suspecioun.
Aboute him lefte he no masoun,°
That stoon coud leye, ne querrour;°
He° hirede hem to make a tour.°
And first, the roses for to kepe,
Aboute hem made he a dich depe,
Right wondir large, and also brode;
Upon the whiche also stode
Of squared stoon a sturdy wall,
Which on a crag was founded all,
And right gret thicknesse eke it bare.
Abouten,° it was founded square,
An hundred fademe° on every side
It was all liche longe and wide.
Lest ony time it were assailed,
Ful wel aboute it was batailed;°
And rounde enviroun eek were set
Ful many a riche and fair touret.°
At every corner of this wall
Was sette a tour full principall;
And everich had, withoute fable,
A portecolis° defensable
To kepe of° enemies, and to greve,
That there hir force wolde preve.
And eek amidde this purprise°
Was maad a tour° of gret maistrise;°
A fairer saugh no man with sight,
Large and wide, and of gret might.
They ne dredde noon assaut
Of ginne,° gunne, nor skaffaut.°
For the temprure° of the mortere°
Was maad of licour° wonder dere;
Of quikke lime persant° and egre,°
The which was tempred with° vinegre.
The stoon was hard of ademant,°
Wherof they maad the foundement.
The tour was rounde, maad in compas;
In all this world no riccher was,
Ne better ordeigned therwithall.
About the tour was maad a wal,
So that, bitwixt that and the tour,
Rosers were set of swete savour,
With many roses that thei bere.
And eek within the castel were
Springoldes,° gunnes, bows, archers;
And eek above, at corners,
Men seyn over the walle stonde
Grete engines, whiche were nigh honde;
And in the kernels,° here and there,
Of arblasters° gret plente were.
Noon armur° might hir strok withstonde,
It were foly to prece to honde.°
Without° the dich were listes° made,
With wall batailed° large and brade,
For men and hors shuld not atteine
To neigh° the diche over the pleine.
Thus Jelousie hath enviroun
Sette aboute his garnisoun°
With walles rounde, and diche depe,
Only the roser for to kepe.
And Daunger eek, erly and late
The keys kepte of the utter° gate,
The which openeth toward the eest.
And he had with him atte leest
Thritty servauntes, echon by name.
 
¶That other gate kepte Shame,
Which openede, as it was couth,°
Toward the parte of the south.
Sergeaunts assigned were hir too
Ful many, hir wille for to doo.
 
¶Than Drede hadde in hir baillie°
The keping of the conestablerie,
Toward the north, I undirstonde,
That opened upon the left honde,
The which for nothing may be sure,
But if° she do hir bisy cure°
Erly on morowe and also late,
Strongly to shette and bar the gate.
Of every thing that she may see
Drede is aferd, wherso she be;
For with a puff of litell winde
Drede is astonied° in hir minde.
Therfore, for° stelinge of the rose,
I rede hir nought the yate unclose.
A foulis° flight wol make hir flee,
And eke a shadowe, if she it see.
 
¶Than Wikked-Tung, ful of envie,
With soudiours of° Normandie,
As he that causeth all the bate,°
Was keper of the fourthe gate,
And also to the tother° three
He went ful ofte, for to see.
Whan his lot was to wake anight,°
His instrumentis wolde he dight,°
For to blowe and make soun,
Ofter than he hath enchesoun;°
And walken oft upon the wall,
Corners and wiketts° overal
Full narwe serchen and espie;
Though he nought fond, yit wolde he lie.
Discordaunt ever fro armonie,
And distoned° from melodie,
Controve° he wolde, and foule faile,°
With hornepipes of Cornewaile.
In floites° made he discordaunce,
And in his musik, with mischaunce,
He wolde seyn, with notes newe,
That he ne fond no womman trewe,
Ne that he saugh never, in his lif,
Unto hir husbonde a trewe wif;
Ne noon so ful of honeste,
That she nil laughe and mery be
Whan that she hereth, or may espie,
A man speken of lecherie.
Everich of hem hath somme vice;
Oon is dishonest, another is nice;°
If oon be full of vilanie,
Another hath a likerous° eye;
If oon be full of wantonesse,
Another is a chideresse.°
 
¶Thus Wikked-Tung (God yeve him shame!)
Can put hem everichone in blame
Withoute desert and causeles;
He lieth, though they ben giltles.
I have pite to seen the sorwe,
That waketh bothe eve and morwe,
To innocents doth such grevaunce;
I pray God yeve him evel chaunce,
That he ever so bisie is
Of ony womman to seyn amis!
 
¶Eek Jelousie God confounde,
That hath ymaad a tour so rounde,
And made aboute a garisoun
To sette Bialacoil in prisoun;
The which is shet there in the tour,
Ful long to holde ther sojour,°
Ther for to liven in penaunce.
And for to do him more grevaunce,
Ther hath ordeined Jelousie
An olde veck,° for to espie
The maner of his governaunce;
The which devel, in hir enfaunce,
Had lerned muche of Loves art,
And of his pleyes toke hir part;
She was expert in his servise.
She knewe ech wrenche° and every gise°
Of love, and every loveres wile,°
It was the harder hir to gile.
Of Bialacoil she toke ay hede,
That evere he liveth in wo and drede.
He kepte him coy° and eek privee,
Lest in him she hadde see
Ony foly countenaunce,
For she knewe all the olde daunce.
And aftir this, whan Jelousie
Had Bialacoil in his baillie,°
And shette him up that was so fre,
For seure of him he wolde° be,
He trusteth sore in his castell;
The stronge werk him liketh well.
He dradde not that no glotons°
Shulde stele his roses or bothons.
The roses weren assured all,
Defenced with the stronge wall.
Now Jelousie full well may be
Of dred devoide, in liberte,
Whether that he slepe or wake;
For of his roses may noon be take.
 
¶But I, allas, now morne° shall;
Bicause I was without° the wal,
Full moche doole° and moone I made.
Who hadde wist° what woo I hadde,
I trowe° he wolde have had pitee.
Love to deere° had sold to me
The good that of his love hadde I.
I wende° a bought it al queintly;°
But now, thurgh doubling of my peine,
I see he wolde it selle ageine,
And me a newe bargein leere,°
The which all-out° the more is deere,
For the solace that I have lorn,°
Thanne° I hadde it never aforn.
Certain I am ful lik, indeede,
To him that caste in erthe his seed;
And hath joie of the newe spring,
Whanne it greneth° in the ginning,
And is so faire and fresh of flour,
Lusty to seen, swoote of odour;
But er he it in sheves shere,°
May falle a weder° that shal it dere,°
And maken it to fade and falle,
The stalk, the grein, and floures alle;
That to the tilier° is fordone°
The hope that he had to sone.°
I dred, certein, that so fare I;
For hope and travaile sikerly°
Ben me biraft all with a storme;
The flour nil seden of° my corne.°
For Love hath so avaunced me,
Whanne I bigan my privitee
To Bialacoil all for to telle,
Whom I ne fond froward ne felle,°
But took agree° all hool my play.
But Love is of so hard assay,
That all at oonis he reved° me,
Whanne I wend° best aboven have be.
It is of Love, as of Fortune,
That chaungeth ofte, and nil contune;°
Which whilom° wole on folke smile,
And gloumbe° on hem another while;
Now freend, now foo, thou shalt hir fele,
For in a twinkling tourneth hir wheel.
She can writhe° hir heed awey,
This is the concours° of hir pley;
She canne areise° that dothe morne,
And whirle adown, and overturne
Who sittith hieghst, but as hir lust;°
A foole is he that wole hir trust.
For it is I that am com doun
Thurgh change and revolucioun!
Sith Bialacoil mot° fro me twinne,°
Shette in the prisoun yond withinne,
His absence at min herte I fele;
For all my joye and all min hele
Was in him and in the rose,
That but° yon wal, which him doth close,
Open, that I may him see,
Love nil not that I cured be
Of the peines that I endure,
Nor of my cruel aventure.
 
¶A, Bialacoil, min owne dere!
Though thou be now a prisonere,
Kepe at leste thin hert to me,
And suffre not that it daunted° be;
Ne lat not Jelousie, in his rage,
Putten thin herte in no servage.
Although he chastice thee withoute,
And make thy body unto him loute,°
Have herte as hard as diamaunt,
Stedefast, and nought pliaunt;°
In prisoun though thy body be,
At large keep thin herte free.
A trewe herte wol not plie°
For no manace that it may drie.°
If Jelousie doth thee paine,
Quite him his while thus againe,
To venge thee, at leest in thought,
If other way thou mayest nought;
And in this wise sotilly
Worche, and winne the maistry.
But yit I am in gret affray°
Lest thou do not as I say;
I dred thou canst me greet maugree,°
That thou emprisoned art for me;
But that is not for my trespas,
For thurgh me never discovered° was
Yit thing that oughte be secree.
Wel more anoy ther is in me,
Than is in thee, of this mischaunce;
For I endure more hard penaunce
Than ony canne seyn or thinke,
That for the sorwe almost I sinke.
Whanne I remembre me of my woo,
Full nigh out of my witt I goo.
Inward min herte I feele blede,
For comfortles the deth I drede.
Owe° I not wel to have distresse,
Whan false,° thurgh hir wikkednesse,
And traitours, that arn envious,
To noyen me be so curious?°
 
¶A, Bialacoil! full wel I see,
That they hem shape to disceive thee,
To make thee buxom° to hir lawe,
And with hir corde thee to drawe
Wher so hem lust, right at hir wil;
I dred they have thee brought thertil.°
Withoute comfort, thought me sleeth;
This game wol bring me to my deeth.
For if your goode wille I lese,°
I mot° be deed; I may not chese.
And if that thou foryete° me,
Min hert shal nevere in liking° be;
Nor elles where find solace,
If I be put out of your grace,

As it shal never been, I hope;
Than shulde I fallen in wanhope.°
 
¶Allas, in wanhope?—nay, pardee!
For I wol never dispeired be.
If Hope me faile, thanne am I
Ungracious and unworthy;
In Hope I wol comforted be,
For Love, whanne he bitaught° hir me,
Said that Hope, wherso I go,
Shulde ay be relees° to my wo.
 
¶But what and° she my bales° beete,°
And be to me curteis and sweete?
She is in nothing full certeine.
Lovers she put in full gret peine,
4445 And makith hem with woo to deele.
Hir fair behest disceiveth feele,°
For she wol bihote,° sikirly,
And failen aftir outrely.°
A! that is a full noyous thing!
For many a lover, in loving,
Hangeth upon hir, and trusteth fast,
Which leese hir traveil° at the last.
Of thing to comen she wot° right nought;
Therfore, if it be wisly sought,
Hir counseill, foly is to take.
For many times, whan she wol make
A full good silogisme,° I dreede
That aftirward ther shal in deede
Folwe an evell conclusioun;
This put me in confusioun.
For many times I have it seen,
That many have bigiled been,
For trust that they have sette in Hope,
Which felle hem aftirward aslope.°
 
¶But natheles yit, gladly she wolde,°
That he, that wole him with hir holde,
Hadde alle times his purpos clere,
Without deceite, or any were.°
That she desireth sikirly;
Whanne I hir blamed, I did foly.
But what availeth hir good wille,
Whan she ne may staunch° my stounde ille?°
That helpith litel, that she may do,
Outake biheest° unto my wo.
And heeste° certein, in no wise,
Withoute yift,° is not to prise.°
 
¶Whan heest and deede asundir varie,
They doon me° have a gret contrarie.°
Thus am I possed° up and doun
With doole,° thought, and confusioun;
Of my disese ther is no noumbre.
Daunger and Shame me encumbre,
Drede also, and Jelousie,
And Wikked-Tung, ful of envie,
Of which the sharpe and cruel ire
Full oft me putte in gret martire.°
They han my joye fully lette,°
Sith Bialacoil they have bishette
Fro me in prisoun wikkidly,
Whom I love so entierly,
That it wol my bane° bee,
But° I the sonner may him see.
And yit moreover, wurst of all,
Ther is set to kepe, foule hir bifalle!
A rimpled° veck,° fer ronne° in age,
Frowning and yelowe in hir visage,
Which in await lith day and night,
That noon of him may have a sight.
 
¶Now mot° my sorwe enforced° be;
Full soth it is, that Love yaf me
Three wonder yiftes of his grace,
Whiche I have lorn° now in this place,
Sith they ne may, withoute drede°
Helpen but litel, who taketh hede.
For here availeth no Swete-Thought,
And Swete-Speche helpith right nought.
The thrid was called Swete-Loking,
That now is lorn,° without lesing.°
 
¶The yiftes were fair, but not forthy°
They helpe me but simply,°
But° Bialacoil may loosed be,
To gon at large and to be free.
For him my lif lith al in doute,
But if he com the rather° oute.
Allas! I trowe° it wol not bene!
For how shulde I evermore him seen?
He may not oute, and that is wronge,
Bicause the tour is so stronge.
How shulde he out? by whos prowesse,
Oute of so strong a forteresse?
By me, certein, it nil be doo;
God woot, I have no wit thertoo!
But wel I wot I was in rage,
Whanne I to Love did homage.
Who was in cause,° in sothfastnesse,
But hirsilf, dame Idelnesse,
Which me conveied, thurgh fair prayere,
To entre into that fair vergere?°
She was to blame me to leve,
The which now doth me soore greve.
A foolis word is nought to trowe,°
Ne worth an appel for to lowe;°
Men shulde him snibbe° bittirly,
At prime temps° of his foly.
I was a fool, and she me leeved,°
Thurgh whom I am right nought releeved.
She accomplisshed all my wille,
That now me greveth wondir ille.
Resoun me seide what shuld falle.
A fool mysilf I may well calle,
That love aside I had not leide,
And trowed that dame Resoun seide.
Resoun had bothe skile° and right.
Whan she me blamed, with all hir might,
To medle of love, that hath me shent;°
But certein now I wol repent.
 
¶“And shulde I repente? Nay, parde!
A fals traitour than shulde I be.
The devells engins° wold me take,
If I my lorde wold forsake,
Or Bialacoil falsly bitraye.
Shulde I at mischeef hate him? nay,
Sith he now, for his curtesie,
Is in prisoun of Jelousie.
Curtesie certein dide he me,
So muche, it may not yolden° be,
Whanne he the hay° passen me lete,
To kiss the rose, faire and swete;
Shulde I therfore cunne him maugre?°
Nay, certeinly, it shal not be;
For Love shal never, if God wille,
Here of me, thurgh word or wille,
Offence or complaint, more or lesse,
Neither of Hope nor Idilnesse;
For certis, it were wrong that I
Hated hem for hir curtesie.
Ther is not els,° but suffre and thinke,
And waken whanne I shulde winke;°
Abide in hope, til Love, thurgh chaunce,
Send me socour or allegeaunce,°
Expectant ay° till I may mete
To geten mercy of that swete.
 
¶“Whilom I thinke how Love to me
Seide he wold taken atte gree°
My servise, if unpacience
Ne caused me to doon offence.
He seide, ‘In thank I shal it take,
And high maister eek thee make,
If wikkedness ne reve it° thee;
But sone, I trowe, that shall not be.’
These were his wordis by and by;
It semed he loved me trewly.
Now is ther not° but serve him wele,
If that I thenke his thank to fele.
My good, min harm, lith hool in me;
In Love may no defaute be;
For trewe Love ne failid never man.
Sothly, the faut mot nedis than
(As God forbeed!) be founde in me,
And how it cometh, I can not see.
Now lat it goon as it may goo;
Whether Love wol socour me or sloo,°
He may do hool on me his wille.
I am so sore bounde him til,°
From his servise I may not fleen;
For lif and deth, withouten wene,°
Is in his hande; I may not chese;
He may me doo both winne and lese.
And sith so sore he doth me greve,
Yit, if my lust° he wolde acheve
To Bialacoil goodly to be,
I yeve no force what felle on me.
For though I die, as I mot nede,°
I pray Love, of his goodlihede,
To Bialacoil do gentilnesse,
For whom I live in such distresse,
That I mot deyen for penaunce.
But first, withoute repentaunce,
I wol me confesse in good entent,
And make in haste my testament,
As lovers doon that feelen smerte:—
To Bialacoil leve I min herte
All hool, withoute departing,°
Or doublenesse° of repenting.”

¶Thus as I made my passage
In compleint, and in cruel rage,
And I not° wher to finde a leche°
That couthe unto min helping eche,°
Sodeinly again comen doun
Out of hir tour I saugh Resoun,
Discrete and wis, and full plesaunt,
And of hir port° full avenaunt.°
The righte° wey she took to me,
Which stode in greet perplexite,
That was posshed° in every side,
That I nist° where I might abide,
Till she, demurely sad° of chere,°
Seid to me as she com nere:—
 
¶“Mine owne freend, art thou yit° greved?
How is this quarell yit acheved°
Of Loves side? Anoon me telle;
Hast thou not yit of love thy fille?
Art thou not wery of thy servise
That thee hath pined° in sich wise?
What joye hast thou in thy loving?
Is it a swete or bitter thing?
Canst thou yit chese, lat me see,
What best thy socour mighte be?
 
¶“Thou servest a full noble lorde,
That maketh thee thrall for thy rewarde,
Which ay° renewith thy turment,
With foly so he hath thee blent.°
Thou fell in mischeef thilke° day,
Whan thou didest, the soth to say,
Obeisaunce and eek homage;
Thou wroughtest nothing° as the sage.°
Whan thou bicam his liege man,
Thou didist a grete foly than;
Thou wistest not° what fell therto,°
With what° lord thou haddist to do.
If thou haddist him wel knowe,
Thou haddist nought be brought so lowe;
For if thou wistest what it were,
Thou noldist serve him half a yeer,
Not a week, nor half a day,
Ne yit an hour without delay,
Ne never loved paramours,
His lordshipp is so full of shoures.°
Knowest him ought?” L’Amaunt . “Ye, dame, parde!”

¶“Love of Freendship also ther is,
Which makith no man done amis,
Of wille knit bitwixe two,
That wol not breke for wel ne wo;
Which long is likly to contune,°
Whan wille and goodis ben in comune;
Grounded by goddis ordinaunce,
Hool, withoute discordaunce;
With hem holding comunte°
Of all her goode in charite,
That ther be noon excepcioun
Thurgh chaunging of entencioun;
That ech helpe other at hir neede,
And wisly hele° both word and dede;
Trewe of mening, devoide of slouthe,
For wit is nought withoute trouthe;°
So that the ton° dar all his thought
Seyn to his freend, and spare nought,
As to himsilf, without dreding
To be discovered by wreying.°
For glad is that conjunccioun,
Whan ther is noon suspecioun
Of blame° in hem whom they wold prove
That trewe and parfit weren in love.
For no man may be amiable,
But if° he be so ferme and stable,
That fortune chaunge him not, ne blinde,°
But that his freend all way him finde,
Both pore and riche, in oon estate.
For if his freend, thurgh ony gate,°
Wol compleine of his poverte,
He shuld not bide so long, til he
Of his helping him requere;
For good deed, done but° thurgh prayere,°
Is sold, and bought to dere,° ywis,
To hert that of gret valour is.
For hert fulfilled of gentilnesse
Can ivel demene° his distresse.
And man that worthy is of name
To asken often hath gret shame.
A good man brenneth° in his thought
For shame, whanne he axeth ought.
He hath gret thought,° and dredith ay
For his disese, whanne he shal pray°
His freend, lest that he warned° be,
Til that he preve his stabiltee.
But whan that he hath founden oon
That trusty is and trew as stone,
And hath assaied him at al,
And found him stedfast as a wal
And of his freendship be certeine,
He shal him shew both joye and peine,
And all that he dar thinke or sey,
Withoute shame, as he wel may.
For how shulde he ashamed be
Of sich one as I tolde thee?
For whanne he woot° his secre thought,
The thrid shal know therof right nought;
For tweine in nombre is bet than three
In every counsel and secree.
Repreve° he dredeth never a dele,
Who that biset his wordis wele;
For every wis man, out of drede,
Can kepe his tung til he see nede;
And fooles can not holde her tunge;
A fooles belle is soone runge.
Yit shal a trewe freend do more
To helpe his felowe of his sore,
And socoure him, whanne he hath nede,
In all that he may done in dede;
And gladder be that he him plesith
Than his felowe that he esith.
And if he do not his requeste,
He shal as mochel him moleste°
As his felow, for that° he
May not fulfille his volunte°
As fully as he hath required.
If both the hertis Love hath fired,°
Joy and wo they shul departe,°
And take evenly ech his parte.
Half his anoy he shal have ay,°
And comfort him what that he may;
And of his blisse part shal he,
If love wol departed be.
 
¶“And whilom° of this amitee°
Spak Tullius in a ditee;°
‘A man shuld maken his request
Unto his freend, that is honeste;°
And he goodly shulde it fulfille,
But it° the more were out of skile,°
And otherwise not graunt therto,
Except only in cases two:
If men his freend to deth wolde drive,
Late him be bisy to save his live.
Also if men wolen him assaile,°
Of his wurship to make him faile,
And hindren him of his renoun,
Late him, with full entencioun,
His dever° done in ech degree
That his freend ne shamed be,
In this two cases with his might,
Taking no kepe to° skill nor right,
As ferre as love may him excuse
This oughte no man to refuse.’
This love that I have told to thee
Is no thing contrarie to me;
This wole I that thou folow wele,
And leve the tother° everydele.°
This love to vertu all attendith,
The tothir fooles blent and shendith.°
 
¶“Another love also there is,
That is contrarie unto this,
Which desire is so constreined
That it is but wille feined;°
Awey fro trouthe it doth so varie,
That to good love it is contrarie;
For it maimeth, in many wise,
Sike hertis with coveitise;
All in winning and in profit
Sich love settith his delite.
This love so hangeth in balaunce
That, if it lese his hope, perchaunce,
Of lucre,° that he is set upon,
It wole faile, and quenche° anon;
For no man may be amerous,
Ne in his living vertuous,
But if he love more, in moode,°
Men for hem silf than for hir goode.
For love that profit doth abide°
Is fals, and bit° not in no tide.°
This Love comth of dame Fortune,
That litel while wol contune;°
For it shal chaungen wonder soone,
And take eclips right as the moone,
Whan she is from us ylet°
Thurgh erthe, that bitwixe is set
The sonne and hir, as it may falle,
Be it in partie, or in alle;
The shadow maketh her bemis merke,°
And hir hornes to shew derke,
That part wher she hath lost hir light
Of Phebus° fully, and the sight;
Til, whan the shadowe is overpaste,
She is enlumined agein as faste,
Thurgh brightnesse of the sonne bemes
That yeveth to hir ageine hir lemes.°
That love is right of sich nature;
Now is it fair, and now obscure.
Now bright, now clipsy° of manere,
And whilom dimme, and whilom° clere.
As soone as Poverte ginneth take,
With mantel° and with wedis° blake
It hidith of Love the light awey,
That into night it turneth day;
It may not see Richesse shine
Til the blacke shadows fine.°
For, whan Richesse shineth bright,
Love recovereth agein his light;
And whanne it failith, he wol flit,°
And as she groweth, so groweth it.
 
¶“Of this love, here what I sey:—
The riche men are loved ay,
And namely° tho° that sparand° bene,
That wol not wasshe hir hertes clene
Of the filth, nor of the vice
Of gredy brenning° avarice.
The rich man full fond° is, ywis,
That weneth° that he loved is.
If that his herte it undirstoode,
It is not he, it is his goode;
He may wel witen° in his thought,
His good is loved, and he right nought.
For if he be a nigard eke,°
Men wol not set by him a leke,°
But haten him; this is the soth.
Lo, what profit his catel° doth!
Of every man that may him see,
It geteth him nought but enmitee.
But° he amende him of that vice,
And knowe himsilf, he is not wis.
 
¶“Certis, he shulde ay freendly be,
To gete him love also ben free,°
Or els he is not wise ne sage
No more than is a gote ramage.°
That he not loveth, his dede proveth,
Whan he his richess so wel loveth,
That he wol hide it ay and spare,°
His pore freendis seen forfare;°
To kepe it ay is his purpose,
Til for drede his iyen° close,
And til a wikked deth him take;
Him hadde lever° asondre shake,
And late his limes° a sondre rive,°
Than leve his richesse in his live.
He thenkith° parte° it with no man;
Certain, no love is in him than.
How shulde love withinne him be,
Whanne in his herte is no pite?
That he trespasseth, wel I wate,°
For ech man knowith his estate;
For wel him ought to be reproved
That loveth nought, ne is not loved.
 
¶“But sith we arn to Fortune comen,
And han our sermoun of hir nomen,°
A wondir will I tell thee nowe,
Thou herdist never sich oon, I trowe.°
I not° wher° thou me leven° shall,
Though sothfastnesse it be in all,
As it is writen, and is soth,
That unto men more profit doth
The froward° Fortune and contraire,
Than the swote° and debonaire:
And if thee thinke it is doutable,
It is thurgh argument provable.
For the debonaire and softe
Falsith and bigilith ofte;
For liche a moder she can cherishe
And milken° as doth a noris;°
And of hir goode to hem deles,°
And yeveth hem part of her joweles,°
With great richesse and dignitee;
And hem she hoteth° stabilitee
In a state that is not stable,
But chaunginge ay and variable;
And fedith hem with glorie veine,
And worldly blisse noncerteine.
Whan she hem settith on hir whele,
Than wene° they to be right wele,
And in so stable state withall,
That never they wene for to fall.
And whan they set so highe be,
They wene to have in certeintee
Of hertly° frendis so grete noumbre,
That no thing might her stat encombre;
They trust hem so on every side,
Wening° with hem they wolde abide
In every perel and mischaunce,
Withoute chaunge or variaunce,
Bothe of catel° and of goode;
And also for to spende° hir bloode
And all hir membris for to spille,
Only to fulfille hir wille.
They maken it hole in many wise,
And hoten° hem hir full servise,
How sore° that it do hem smerte,°
Into hir very naked sherte!
Herte and all, so hool° they yeve,
For the time that they may live,
So that, with all her flaterie,
They maken foolis glorifie°
Of hir wordis greet speking,
And han thereof a rejoysing,
And trowe hem as the Evangile;°
And it is all falsheede and gile,
As they shal afterwarde se,
Whan they arn falle in povertee,
And been of good and catel bare;
Than shuld they seen who freendis ware.
For of an hundred, certeinly,
Nor of a thousand full scarsly,
Ne shal they finde unnethis° oon,
Whan poverte is comen upon.
For this Fortune that I of telle,
With men whan hir lust° to dwelle,
Makith hem to lese hir conisaunce,°
And nourishith hem in ignoraunce.
 
¶“But froward Fortune and perverse,
Whan high estatis she doth reverse,
And maketh hem to tumble doune
Of° hir wheel, with sodein tourne,
And from hir richess doth hem fle,
And plongeth hem in poverte,
And as a stepmoder envious,
Leyeth a plastre° dolorous
Unto her hertis, wounded egre,°
Which is not tempred° with vinegre,
But with poverte and indigence,
For to shew, by experience,
That she is Fortune verelie
In whom no man shulde affie,°
Nor in hir yeftis° have fiaunce,°
She is so full of variaunce.
Thus can she maken high and lowe,
Whan they from richesse aren throwe,
Fully to knowen, withouten were,°
Freend of effect,° and freend of chere;°
And which in love were trew and stable,
And whiche also were variable,
After Fortune, hir goddesse,
In poverte, outher in richesse;
For all she yeveth, out of drede,
Unhap° bereveth° it in dede;
For Infortune lat° not oon
Of freendis, whan Fortune is goon;
I mene tho freendis that wol fle
Anoon as° entreth poverte.
And yit they wol not leve hem so,
But in ech place wher they go
They calle hem ‘wrecche,’ scorne and blame,
And of hir mishappe hem diffame,
And, namely, siche as in richesse
Pretendith most of stablenesse,
Whan that they sawe him set onlofte,
And weren of him socoured ofte,
And most yholpe in all hir nede:
But now they take no maner hede,
But seyn, in voice of flaterie,
That now apperith hir folie,
Overall wher so they fare,
And singe, ‘Go, farewel feldfare.’°
All such freendis I beshrewe,°
For of the trew ther be to fewe;
But sothfast freendis, what so bitide,
In every fortune wolen abide;
They han hir hertis in such noblesse
That they nil love for no richesse;
Nor, for that° Fortune may hem sende,
They wolen hem socoure and defende;
And chaunge for softe ne for sore,
For who is freend, loveth evermore.
Though men draw swerde his freend to slo,
He may not hewe hir love atwo.
But, in the case that I shall sey,
For pride and ire lese it he may,
And for reprove by nicete,°
And discovering° of privite,°
With tonge wounding, as feloun,°
Thurgh venemous detraccioun.
Frende in this cas wol gone his way,
For nothing greve him more ne may;
And for nought ellis wole he flee,
If that he love in stabilitee.
And certein, he is wel bigone.
Among a thousand that findith one.
For there may be no richesse,
Ageins° frendship, of worthinesse;
For it° ne may so high atteigne
As may the valour,° soth to seyne,
Of him that loveth trew and well;
Frendship is more than is catel.°
For freend in court ay better is
Than peny in his purs, certis;
And Fortune, mishapping,°
Whanne upon men she is falling,
Thurgh misturning of hir chaunce,
And casteth hem oute of balaunce,
She makith, thurgh hir adversitee,
Men full clerly for to see
Him that is freend in existence
From him that is by apparence.
For Infortune makith anoon
To know thy freendis fro thy foon,
By experience, right as it is;
The which is more to preise, ywis,°
Than is mich° richesse and tresour;
For more doth profit and valour
Poverte, and such adversite,
Bifore than doth prosperitee;
For that oon yeveth conisaunce,°
And the tother ignoraunce.
 
¶“And thus in poverte is in dede
Trouth declared fro falshede;
For feinte frendis it wol declare,
And trewe also, what wey they fare.°
For whanne he was in his richesse,
These freendis, ful of doublenesse,
Offrid him in many wise
Hert and body, and servise.
What wolde he than you to have bought
To knowen openly her thought,
That he now hath so clerly seen?
The lass bigiled he sholde have been
And° he had than perceived it,
But richess nold not late him wit.
Wel more avauntage doth him than,
Sith that it makith a wis man,
The gret mischeef that he receiveth,
Than doth richess that him deceiveth.
Richesse rich ne makith nought
Him that on tresour set his thought;
For richess° stonte in suffisaunce
And nothing in habundaunce;
For suffisaunce all onely
Makith men to live richly.
For he that hath but° miches° tweine,
Ne mor value in his demeigne,°
Liveth more at ese, and more is riche,
Than dothe he that is so chiche,°
And in his berne hath, soth to seyn,
An hundred muwis° of whete grein,
Though he be chapman° or marchaunte,
And have of gold many besaunte.°
For in the geting he hath such wo,
And in the keping drede also,
And sette evermore his bisinesse
For to encrese, and not to lesse,
For to augment and multiply.
And though on hepis it lie him by,
Yit never shal make his richesse
Asseth unto° his gredinesse.
But the pour° that recchith° nought,
Save of his liflode,° in his thought,
Which that he getith with his travaile,
He dredith nought that it shall faile,
Though he have litel worldis goode,
Mete and drinke, and esy food,
Upon° his travel° and living,
And also suffisaunt clothing.
Or if in siknesse that he fall,
And lothe mete° and drink withall,
Though he have nought, his meat to by,
He shall bithinke him hastely,
To putte him out of all daunger,
That he of mete hath no mister;°
Or that he may with litel eke
Be founden,° whil that he is seke;
Or that men shul him bere in haste,
To live, til his sikness be past,
To somme maisondew° biside;°
He cast° nought what shal him bitide.°
He thenkith nought that evere he shall
Into ony sikness fall.
 
¶“And though it fall, as it may be,
That al betime° spare° shall he
As mochel as shall to him suffice,
Whil he is sike in ony wise,
He dothe, for that he wol be
Contente with his povertee
Withoute nede of ony man.
So miche° in litel have he can,
He is apaied° with his fortune;
And for he nil° be importune
Unto no wight,° ne onerous,°
Nor of hir goodes coveitous;
Therfore he spareth, it may wel been,
His pore estat for to sustene.
 
¶“Or if him lust not for to spare,
But suffrith forth, as not ne ware,°
At last it hapneth, as it may,
Right unto his laste day,
And taketh the world as it wold be;
For ever in herte thenkith he,
The soner that the deth him slo,°
To paradis the soner go

Wher that he shal no goode misse.
Thider he hopith God shal him sende
Aftir his wrecchid lives ende.
Pictagoras himsilf reherses,
In a book that the Golden verses
Is clepid,° for the nobilite
Of the honourable dite:°—
‘Than, whan thou gost thy body fro,
Free in the eir thou shalt up go,
And leven° al humanite,
And purely live in deite.’°—
He is a fool, withouten were,°
That trowith° have his countre here.
‘In erthe is not our countre,’
That may these clerkis seyn and see
In Boece of Consolacioun,
Where it is maked mencioun
Of our countre plein at the eye,
By teching of philosophie,
Wher lewid° men might lere wit,°
Whoso that wold translaten it.
If he be sich that can wel live
Aftir his rente° may him yive,°
And not desireth more to have,
That may fro poverte him save:
A wis man seide, as we may seen,
Is no man wrecched, but he it wene,°
Be he king, knight, or ribaude.°
And many a ribaude is mery and baude,°
That swinkith,° and berith,° both day and night,
Many a burthen of grete might,
The whiche doth him lasse offense,
For he suffrith in pacience.
They laugh and daunce, trippe° and singe,
And ley not up for her living,
But in the taverne all dispendith
The winning that God hem sendith.
Than goth he, fardels° for to bere,
With as good chere as he dide ere;
To swinke and traveile he not feinith,°
For for to robben he disdeinith;°
But right anoon, aftir his swinke,°
He goth to tavern for to drinke.
All these ar riche in abundaunce,
That can thus have suffisaunce
Wel more than can an usurere,°
As God wel knowith, withoute were.°
For an usurer, so God me se,
Shal never for richess rich be,
But evermore pore and indigent,
Scarce, and gredy in his entent.°
 
¶“For soth it is, whom it displese,

That it quik brenneth° more to get,
Ne never shal enough have geten;
Though he have gold in gerners° yeten,°
For to be nedy he dredith sore.
Wherfore to geten more and more

So hote he brennith in the fire
Of coveitise, that makith him woode°
To purchase other mennes goode.
He undirfongith° a gret peine,
That undirtakith to drinke up Seine;
For the more he drinkith, ay
The more he leveth, the soth to say.
This is the thurst of fals geting,
That laste° ever in coveiting,
And the anguisshe and distresse
With the fire of gredinesse.
She fighteth with him ay, and striveth,
That his herte asondre riveth;°
Such gredinesse him assailith,
That whanne he most hath, most he failith.
 
¶Phisiciens and advocates°
Gon right by the same yates;°

And haunte° hir craft for gret geting.
Hir winning is of such swetnesse,
That if a man falle in siknesse,

For by hir will, withoute lees,
Everich manne shuld be seke,
And though they die, they set not a leke.°
After, whan they the gold have take,
Full litel care for hem they make.
They wold that fourty were seke at onis,
Ye, two hundred, in flesh and bonis,
And yit two thousand, as I gesse,
For to encresen her richesse.
They wol not worchen, in no wise,
But for lucre and coveitise;
For fisik ginneth first by fi ,°
The phisicien also sothely;
And sithen it goth fro fi to si ;°
To truste on hem, it is foly;
For they nil,° in no maner gre,°
Do righte nought for charite.
 
¶“Eke in the same secte ar sette

Her hertis arn in great distresse,

And toward God have no memorie,
But forth as ypocrites trace,°
And to her soules deth purchace,

Bigiled° is the giler than.
For preching of a cursed man,
