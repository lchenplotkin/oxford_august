¶A marchant whilom° dwelled at Seint Denis,
That riche was, for which men helde° him wis;
A wif he hadde of excellent beautee,
And compaignable° and revelous° was she,
Which is a thing that causeth more dispence°
Than worth is al the cheere° and reverence
That men hem doon° at festes and at daunces;
Swich salutaciouns and contenaunces°
Passen as dooth a shadwe° upon the wal.
But wo is him that payen moot° for al;
The sely° housbonde, algate° he moot paye;
He moot us clothe, and he moot us arraye,°
Al for his owne worship richely,
In which array we daunce jolily.°
And if that he noght may,° paraventure°
Or elles, list° no swich° dispence° endure,°
But thinketh it is wasted and ylost,
Than moot another payen for our cost,
Or lene° us gold, and that is perilous.

¶This noble marchant heeld a worthy° hous,°
For which he hadde alday° so greet repair°
For° his largesse,° and for his wif was fair,
That wonder is; but herkneth to my tale.
Amonges alle his gestes,° grete and smale,
Ther was a monk, a fair man and a bold,
I trowe° of thritty winter° he was old,
That ever in oon° was drawing to that place.
This yonge monk, that was so fair of face,
Aqueinted was so with the goode man,
Sith that hir° firste knowelich° bigan,
That in his hous as famulier° was he
As it possible is any freend to be.

¶And for as muchel as this goode man
And eek this monk, of which that I bigan,
Wer bothe two yborn in o° village,
The monk him claimeth as for cosinage;°
And he again, he seith nat ones nay,
But was as glad therof as fowel° of day;
For to his herte it was a greet plesaunce.°
Thus been they knit with eterne° alliaunce,
And ech of hem gan other for t’assure
Of bretherhede, whil that° hir° lif may dure.°

¶Free was daun John, and manly° of dispence,°
As in that hous; and ful of diligence
To doon plesaunce, and also greet costage.°
He noght forgat to yeve° the leeste page°
In al that hous; but, after° hir degree,
He yaf the lord, and sitthe° al his meinee,°
Whan that he cam, som manere° honest° thing;
For which they were as glad of his coming
As fowl is fain,° whan that the sonne upriseth.
Na more of this as now, for it suffiseth.

¶But so bifel,° this marchant on a day
Shoop him° to make redy his array°
Toward the toun of Brugges for to fare,°
To byen ther a porcioun° of ware;°
For which he hath to Paris sent anon
A messager, and preyed° hath daun John
That he shold come to Seint Denis to pleye°
With him and with his wif a day or tweye,
Er he to Brugges wente, in alle wise.°

¶This noble monk, of which I yow devise,°
Hath of his abbot, as him list,° licence,°
Bicause he was a man of heigh prudence,
And eek an officer,° out for to ride,
To seen hir graunges° and hir bernes° wide;
And unto Seint Denis he comth anon.
Who was so welcome as my lord daun John,
Our dere cosin, ful of curteisie?
With him broghte he a jubbe° of malvesie,°
And eek another, ful of fin vernage,°
And volatil,° as ay was his usage.
And thus I lete° hem ete and drinke and pleye,
This marchant and this monk, a day or tweye.

¶The thridde day, this marchant up ariseth,
And on his nedes° sadly° him aviseth,°
And up into his countourhous° goth he
To reken° with himself, as wel may be,
Of thilke yeer, how that it with him stood,
And how that he despended° hadde his good;°
And if that he encressed were° or noon.
His bookes and his bagges many oon
He leith biforn him on his counting-bord;°
Ful riche was his tresor and his hord,°
For which ful faste° his countour-dore he shette;°
And eek he nold° that no man sholde him lette°
Of° his accountes, for the mene time;
And thus he sit til it was passed prime.°

¶Daun John was risen in the morwe° also,
And in the gardin walketh to and fro,
And hath his thinges° seid ful curteisly.

¶This goode wif cam walking prively°
Into the gardin, ther° he walketh softe,°
And him saleweth,° as she hath don ofte.
A maide° child cam in hir compaignie°
Which as hir list° she may governe and gie,°
For yet under the yerde° was the maide.
“O dere cosin min, daun John,” she saide,
“What eileth° yow so rathe for to rise?”°

¶“Nece,” quod he, “it oghte ynough suffise
Five houres for to slepe upon a night,
But° it wer for an old appalled° wight,°
As been thes wedded men, that lie and dare°
As in a forme° sit° a wery hare,
Were° al forstraught° with houndes grete and smale.
But dere nece, why be ye so pale?
I trowe° certes that our goode man
Hath yow laboured° sith the night bigan,
That yow were need° to resten hastily.”
And with that word he lough° ful merily,
And of his owne thought he wax° al reed.

¶This faire wif gan for to shake hir heed,
And seide thus, “Ye, God wot° al,” quod she;
“Nay, cosin min, it stant° nat so with me.
For, by that God that yaf° me soule and lif,
In al the reawme° of France is ther no wif
That lasse lust° hath to that sory pley.°
For I may singe ‘Allas’ and ‘Weilawey,°
That I was born,’ but to no wight,” quod she,
“Dar I nat tell how that it stant with me.
Wherfore° I thinke out of this land to wende,°
Or elles of myself to make an ende,
So ful am I of drede° and eek of care.”°

¶This monk bigan upon this wif to stare,
And seide, “Allas, my nece, God forbede
That ye, for any sorwe or any drede,
Fordo° yourself; but telleth me your grief;
Paraventure° I may, in your meschief,°
Conseille° or helpe, and therfor telleth me
Al your anoy,° for it shal been secree;
For on my porthors° here I make an ooth,
That nevere in my lif, for lief ne loth,°
Ne shal I of no conseil° yow biwreye.”°

¶“The same again to yow,” quod she, “I seye;
By God and by this porthors, I yow swere,
Though men me wolde al into peces tere,
Ne shal I never, for to goon° to helle,
Biwreie a word of thing that ye me telle,
Nat for° no cosinage° ne alliance,°
But verraily, for love and affiance.”°
Thus been they sworn, and heerupon° they kiste,
And ech of hem tolde other what hem liste.°

¶“Cosin,” quod she, “if that I hadde a space,°
As I have noon, and namly in this place,
Than wolde I telle a legende of my lif,
What I have suffred sith I was a wif
With min housbonde, al be he° your cosin.”

¶“Nay,” quod this monk, “by God and Seint Martin,
He is namore cosin unto me
Than is this leef that hangeth on the tree!
I clepe° him so, by Seint Denis of Fraunce,
To have the more cause of aqueintaunce
Of yow, which I have loved specially
Aboven alle wommen sikerly;°
This swere I yow on my professioun.°
Telleth your grief, lest that he come adoun,
And hasteth yow,° and gooth your wey anon.”

¶“My dere love,” quod she, “O my daun John,
Ful lief wer me° this conseil for to hide,
But out it moot,° I may namore abide.°
Min housbond is to me the worste man
That ever was, sith that the world bigan.
But sith I am a wif, it sit° nat me
To tellen no wight of our privetee,°
Neither abed, ne in noon other place;
God shilde° I sholde it tellen, for his grace!
A wif ne shal nat seyn of hir housbonde
But° al honour, as I can understonde;
Save unto yow thus muche I tellen shal;
As help me God, he is noght worth at al
In no degree the value of a flie.°
But yet me greveth° most his nigardie;°
And wel ye woot that wommen naturelly
Desiren thinges sixe, as wel as I.
They wolde that hir housbonds sholde be
Hardy,° and wise, and riche, and therto° free,°
And buxom° to his wif, and fresh° abedde.°
But, by that ilke lord that for us bledde,
For his honour, myself for to arraye,°
A° Sonday next, I moste nedes° paye
An hundred franks, or elles am I lorn.°
Yet were me lever° that I were unborn
Than me were doon a sclaundre° or vileinie;
And if min housbond eek it mighte espie,°
I nere but° lost, and therfore I yow preye
Leen° me this somme, or elles moot I deye.
Daun John, I sey, leen me thes hundred frankes;
Pardee,° I wol nat faille yow° my thankes,
If that yow list° to doon that° I yow praye.
For at a certein day I wol yow paye,
And doon to yow what plesance° and service
That I may doon, right as° yow list° devise.
And but° I do, God take on me vengeance
As foul as ever had Geniloun of France!”

¶This gentil° monk answerde in this manere;
“Now, trewely, min owne lady dere,
I have,” quod he, “on yow so greet a routhe,°
That I yow swere and plighte° yow my trouthe,°
That whan your housbonde is to Flaundres fare,
I wol deliver yow out of this care;°
For I wol bringe yow an hundred frankes.”
And with that word he caughte hir by the flankes,
And hire embraceth harde,° and kiste hir ofte.
“Goth now your wey,” quod he, “al stille and softe,°
And lat us dine as soone as that ye may;
For by my chilindre° it is prime of day.
Goth now, and beeth as trewe as I shal be.”

¶“Now, elles° God forbede, sir,” quod she,
And forth she gooth, as jolif° as a pie,°
And bad the cookes that they sholde hem hie,°
So that men mighte dine, and that anon.°
Up to hir housbonde is this wif ygon,°
And knokketh at his countour° boldely.

¶“Qui la?” quod he. “Peter! it am I,”
Quod she, “what, sir, how longe wol ye faste?
How longe time wol ye rekene° and caste°
Your sommes, and your bokes, and your thinges?°
The devel have part° of al swich rekeninges!
Ye have ynough, pardee, of Goddes sonde;°
Com doun today, and lat your bagges stonde.
Ne be ye nat ashamed that daun John
Shal fasting al this day elenge° goon?
What! Lat us here° a messe,° and go we° dine.”

¶“Wif,” quod this man, “litel canstow devine°
The curious° bisinesse° that we have.
For of us chapmen,° also God me save,
And by that lord that cleped° is Seint Ive,
Scarsly amonges twelve twein° shul thrive,°
Continuelly, lastinge unto our age.°
We may wel make chere° and good visage,°
And drive forth° the world as it may be,
And kepen oure estaat° in privetee,°
Til we be deed, or elles that° we pleye°
A pilgrimage, or goon out of the weye.
And therfore have I greet necessitee
Upon this queinte° world t’avise° me;
For evermo we mote° stonde in drede°
Of hap° and fortune in our chapmanhede.°

¶To Flaundres wol I go tomorwe at day,°
And come again, as soone as ever I may.
For which, my deere wif, I thee biseke,°
As be to every wight buxom° and meke,
And for to kepe our good° be curious,°
And honestly governe wel our hous.
Thou hast ynough, in every maner wise,
That to a thrifty° houshold may suffise.
Thee lakketh noon array° ne no vitaille,°
Of silver in thy purs shaltow nat faille.”
And with that word his countour-dore he shette,°
And doun he gooth, no lenger wolde he lette,°
But hastily a messe° was ther seid,
And spedily the tables were yleid,°
And to the diner faste they hem spedde;°
And richely this monk the chapman° fedde.

¶At after° diner daun John sobrely°
This chapman took apart,° and prively°
He seide him thus, “Cosin, it standeth so,
That wel I see to Brugges wol ye go.
God and Seint Austin spede° yow and gide!°
I pray yow, cosin, wisly that ye ride;
Governeth yow° also of your diete
Atemprely,° and namly° in this hete.
Bitwix us two nedeth no strange fare;°
Farwel, cosin; God shilde° yow fro care.°
And if that any thing by day or night,
If it lie in my power and my might,
That ye me wol comande in any wise,
It shal be doon, right as ye wol devise.°

¶“O thing, er that ye goon, if it may be,
I wolde prey yow; for to lene° me
An hundred frankes, for a wike° or tweye,
For certein beestes° that I moste beye,°
To store° with a place that is oures.
God help me so, I wolde° it were youres!
I shal nat faille seurly of° my day,
Nat for a thousand franks, a mile-way.°
But lat this thing be secree,° I yow preye,
For yet° tonight thise beestes moot I beye;
And far now wel, min owne cosin dere,
Graunt mercy of° your cost° and of your chere.”°

¶This noble marchant gentilly° anon
Answerde, and seide, “O cosin min, daun John,
Now sikerly this is a smal requeste;
My gold is youres, whan that it yow leste.°
And nat only my gold, but my chaffare;°
Tak what yow list, God shilde° that ye spare.°

¶“But o thing is, ye knowe it wel ynogh,
Of chapmen,° that hir moneie is hir plogh.°
We may creaunce° whil we have a name,
But goldlees° for to be, it is no game.°
Paye it again whan it lith° in youre ese;°
After my might° ful fain wolde I yow plese.”

¶Thes hundred franks he fette° forth anon,
And prively° he took° hem to daun John.
No wight in al this world wiste° of this lone,
Saving° this marchant and daun John allone.
They drinke, and speke, and rome° a while and pleye,
Til that° daun John rideth to his abbeye.

¶The morwe cam, and forth this marchant rideth
To Flaundresward;° his prentis° wel him gideth,
Til he cam into Brugges murily.
Now gooth this marchant faste and bisily°
Aboute his nede,° and byeth° and creaunceth.°
He neither pleyeth at the dees° ne daunceth;
But as a marchant, shortly for to telle,
He let° his lif, and there I lete him dwelle.

¶The Sonday next° this marchant was agon,
To Seint Denis ycomen is daun John,
With crowne° and berd all fresh and newe yshave.°
In al the hous ther nas so litel a knave,°
Ne no wight elles, that he nas° ful fain,°
For that my lord daun John was come again.
And shortly to the point right for to gon,
This faire wif accorded° with daun John,
That for thes hundred franks he sholde al night
Have hir in his armes bolt-upright;°
And this acord° parfourned° was in dede.
In mirthe° al night a bisy lif they lede
Til it was day, that daun John wente his way,
And bad the meinee° “Farwel, have good day!”
For noon of hem, ne no wight in the toun,
Hath of daun John right no suspecioun.°
And forth he rideth hoom to his abbeye,
Or where him list;° namore of him I seye.

¶This marchant, whan that ended was the faire,°
To Seint Denis he gan for to repaire,°
And with his wif he maketh feste and chere,°
And telleth hir that chaffare° is so dere,°
That nedes moste he make a chevisaunce.°
For he was bounde in a reconissaunce°
To paye twenty thousand sheeld° anon.
For which this marchant is to Paris gon,
To borwe of certein frendes that he hadde
A certein° franks; and som with him he ladde.°
And whan that he was come into the toun,
For greet chiertee° and greet affeccioun,
Unto daun John he gooth° him first, to pleye;
Nat for to axe or borwe of him moneye,
But for to wite° and seen of his welfare,
And for to tellen him of his chaffare,°
As freendes doon whan they ben met yfere.°

¶Daun John him maketh feste and mury chere;°
And he him tolde again ful specially,°
How he had wel yboght and graciously,°
Thanked be God, al hool° his marchandise.
Save° that he moste, in alle maner wise,
Maken a chevisaunce,° as for his beste,°
And thanne he sholde been in joye and reste.
Daun John answerde, “Certes, I am fain°
That ye in hele° ar comen hoom again.
And if that I were riche, as have I blisse,
Of twenty thousand sheeld shold ye nat misse,°
For ye so kindely this other day
Lent me gold; and as I can and may,
I thanke yow, by God and by Seint Jame!
But nathelees I took° unto our dame,°
Your wif at hoom, the same gold agein
Upon your bench;° she woot° it wel, certein,
By certein toknes° that I can yow telle.
Now, by your leve, I may no lenger dwelle,°
Oure abbot wol° out of this toun anon;
And in his compaignye moot I gon.
Greet wel our dame, min owne nece swete,
And farwel, dere cosin, til we mete!”

¶This marchant, which that was ful war° and wis,
Creaunced° hath, and paid eek in Paris,
To certein Lumbards, redy in hir hond,°
The somme of gold, and gat of hem his bond;
And hoom he gooth, murie as a papejay.°
For wel he knew he stood in swich array,°
That nedes moste he° winne in that viage°
A thousand franks above al his costage.°

¶His wif ful redy mette him at the gate,
As she was wont° of old usage° algate,°
And al that night in mirthe° they bisette;°
For he was riche and cleerly out of dette.
Whan it was day, this marchant gan embrace
His wif al newe,° and kiste hire on hir face,
And up he gooth and maketh it ful tough.°

¶“Namoor,” quod she, “by God, ye have ynough!”
And wantounly° again° with him she pleide;
Til, atte laste, thus this Marchant seide,
“By God,” quod he, “I am a litel wrooth°
With yow, my wif, although it be me looth.°
And woot ye why? by God, as that I gesse,
That ye han maad° a maner straungenesse°
Bitwixen me and my cosin daun John.
Ye sholde han warned me, er° I had gon,
That he yow hadde an hundred frankes paied
By redy tokne;° and heeld him evel apaied,°
For that I to him spak of chevisance,°
Me semed so,° as by his contenance.°
But nathelees, by God our hevene king,
I thoghte nat to axe of him nothing.°
I pray thee, wif, ne do namoore so;
Tel me alwey, er that I fro thee go,
If any dettour° hath in min absence
Ypayed thee; lest, thurgh thy necligence,
I mighte him axe a thing that he hath paied.”

¶This wif was nat afered° nor affraied,°
But boldely she seide, and that anon:
“Mary, I defy° the false monk, daun John!
I keep nat of° hise toknes° nevere a deel;
He took° me certein° gold, this woot° I weel!
What! ivel° thedom° on his monkes snoute!
For, God it woot, I wend,° withouten doute,
That he had yeve° it me bicause of yow,
To doon therwith min honour and my prow,°
For cosinage,° and eek for bele cheere°
That he hath had ful ofte times heere.
But sith I see I stonde in this disjoint,°
I wol answer yow shortly, to the point.
Ye han mo slakker° dettours than am I!
For I wol pay yow wel and redily
Fro day to day; and, if so be° I faille,
I am your wif; score it upon my taille,°
And I shal paye, as soone as evere I may.
For, by my trouthe, I have on min array,°
And nat on wast,° bistowed every deel.°
And for I have bistowed it so weel
For youre honour, for Goddes sake, I seye,
As be nat wrooth,° but lat us laughe and pleye.
Ye shal my joly° body have to wedde;°
By God, I wol nat pay yow but abedde.
Forgive it me, min owne spouse dere;
Turn hiderward° and maketh bettre chere.”°

¶This marchant saugh ther was no remedie,
And, for to chide,° it ner but° greet folie,
Sith that the thing may nat amended be.
“Now, wif,” he seide, “and I foryeve it thee;
But, by thy lif, ne be namoor so large;°
Keep bet° our good,° this yeve I thee in charge.”
Thus endeth now my tale, and God us sende
Taillinge° ynough unto our lives ende.
