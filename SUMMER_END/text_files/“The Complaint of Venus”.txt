Ther nis so high comfort to my plesaunce,
Whan that I am in eny hevinesse,°
As for to have leiser° of remembraunce
Upon the manhod and the worthinesse,
Upon the trouthe,° and on the stidfastnesse
Of him whos I am al, whil I may dure;°
Ther oghte blame me no creature,
For every wight° preiseth his gentilesse.
 
In him is bountee,° wisdom, governaunce°
Wel mor then eny mannes wit can gesse;
For grace hath wold° so ferforthe° him avaunce°
That of knighthode he is parfit° richesse.°
Honour honoureth him for his noblesse;
Therto° so wel hath formed him Nature,
That I am his for ever, I him assure,
For every wight preiseth his gentilesse.
 
And notwithstanding al his suffisaunce,°
His gentil herte is of so grete humblesse
To me in worde, in werk,° in contenaunce,°
And me to serve is al his besinesse,
That I am set in verrey sikirnesse.°
Thus oghte I blesse° wel min aventure,°
Sith that him list° me serven and honoure;
For every wight preiseth his gentilesse.

Now certes, Love, hit is right convenable°
That men ful dere bie° thy noble thinge,
As wake° abed,° and fasten° at the table,
Weping to laugh, and sing in compleininge,°
And doun to caste visage and lokinge,
Often to chaungen huwe° and contenaunce,°
Pleine in sleping, and dremen at the daunce,
Al the reverse of any glad felinge.
 
Though° Jalousie wer hanged by a cable,°
She wold al° knowe thro° hir espying;
Ther doth no wight° nothing° so resonable,
That al nis° harm in hir imageninge.
Thus dere abought is love in yevinge,°
Which ofte he° yiveth withouten ordinaunce,°
As sorow ynogh,° and litel of plesaunce,
Al the reverse of any glad felinge.
 
A litel time his yift is agreable,
But ful encomberous° is the usinge;
For subtil Jalousie, the deceivable,°
Ful often time causeth destourbinge.
Thus be we ever in drede and sufferinge,
In nouncertein° we languisshe in penaunce,°
And han ful often many an hard meschaunce,
Al the reverse of ony° glad felinge.

But certes, Love, I sey° nat in such wise°
That for tʼescape out of your lace° I mente;
For I so longe have been in your servise
That for to lete of° wil I never assente;
No force° thogh Jalousie me mor tormente;
Sufficeth me to see him when I may,
And therfor certes, to min ending day
To love him best ne shal I never repente.
 
And certes, Love, when I me wel avise°
On eny estat° that man may represente,
Than have ye maked me, through your franchise,°
Chese° the best that ever on erthe wente.
Now love wel, hert, and look thou never stente;°
And let the jelous put hit in assay°
That, for no peine wil I not sey nay;
To love him best ne shal I never repente.
 
Hert, to thee hit oghte ynogh suffise
That Love so highe a grace hath to thee sente,
To chese the worthiest in alle wise°
And most agreable unto min entente.°
Seche no ferther, neither wey° ne wente,°
Sithe I have suffisaunce° unto my pay.°
Thus wol I ende this compleint or lay;°
To love him best ne shal I never repente.
 
Lenvoy
 
Princes, receiveth this compleint in gree,°
Unto your excellent benignitee
Directe after° my litel suffisaunce.°
For eld,° that in my spirit dulleth me,
Hath of enditing° al the soteltee°
Wel nigh bereft° out of my remembraunce;°
And eek to me hit is a greet penaunce,°
Sith rim° in English hath such scarsitee,
To folow word by word the curiositee°
Of Graunson, floure° of hem that make° in Fraunce.
