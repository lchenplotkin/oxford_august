¶By that° the Maunciple hadde his tale al ended,

The sonne fro the south line° was descended

So lowe, that he nas nat,° to my sighte,

Degreës nine and twenty as in° highte.

Foure of the clokke it was tho, as I gesse;

For eleven foot, or litel more or lesse,

My shadwe was at thilke° time, as there,°

Of swich feet as my lengthe parted° were

In six feet equal of proporcioun.

Therwith the mones exaltacioun,°

I mene Libra, alwey° gan ascende,

As we were entringe at a thropes ende;°

For which our Host, as he was wont to gie,°

As in this caas, our joly companie,

Seide in this wise,° “Lordinges everichoon,°

Now lakketh us no tales mo than oon.

Fulfild is my sentence and my decree;

I trow° that we han herd of ech degree.°

Almost fulfild is al min ordinaunce;°

I prey to God, so yeve him right good chaunce,

That telleth this tale to us lustily.°

Sir preest,” quod he, “artow° a vicary?°

Or art a person?° sey sooth,° by thy fey!°

Be what thou be,° ne breke thou° nat our pley;°

For every man, save° thou, hath told his tale,

Unbokel,° and shewe us what is in thy male;°

For trewely, me thinketh, by thy chere,

Thou sholdest knitte up° wel a greet matere.

Tel us a fable° anon, for cokkes bones!”°

¶This Persone him answerde, al at ones,

“Thou getest fable noon ytold for° me;

For Paul, that writeth unto Timothee,

Repreveth hem that weiven° soothfastnesse,°

And tellen fables and swich wrecchednesse.

Why sholde I sowen draf° out of my fest,°

Whan I may sowen whete, if that me lest?°

For which° I seye,° if that yow list° to here

Moralitee and vertuous matere,

And than that° ye wol yeve me audience,

I wol ful fain,° at° Cristes reverence,

Do yow plesaunce leefful,° as I can.

But trusteth wel, I am a southren man,

I can nat geste° rum, ram, ruf° by lettre,

Ne, God wot,° rim° holde° I but litel bettre;

And therfor, if yow list, I wol nat glose.°

I wol yow telle a mery° tale in prose

To knitte up al this feeste,° and make an ende.

And Jesu, for° his grace, wit° me sende

To shewe yow the wey, in this viage,°

Of thilke° parfit glorious pilgrimage

That hight° Jerusalem celestial.

And, if ye vouchesauf,° anon I shal

Biginne upon my tale, for whiche I preye

Telle your avis,° I can no bettre seye.

But nathelees, this meditacioun

I putte it ay° under correccioun

Of clerkes, for I am nat textual;°

I take but the sentens,° trusteth wel.

Therfor I make protestacioun

That I wol stonde to° correccioun.”

¶Upon this word° we han assented sone,

For, as us semed, it was for to done,°

To enden in som vertuous sentence,

And for to yeve him space° and audience

And bede° our Host he sholde to him seye,

That alle we to telle his tale him preye.°

Our Hoste had the wordes for us alle:—

“Sir preest,” quod he, “now faire yow bifalle!°

Sey what yow list,° and we wol gladly here”—

And with that word he seide in this manere—

“Telleth,” quod he, “your meditacioun.°

But hasteth yow, the sonne wol adoun;

Beth fructuous,° and that in litel space,

And to do wel God sende yow his grace!”
