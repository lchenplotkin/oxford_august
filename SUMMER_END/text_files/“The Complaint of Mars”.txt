Gladeth,° ye foules, of the morrow° gray,
Lo!° Venus risen among yon° rowes° rede!°
And floures fresshe, honoureth ye this day;
For when the sonne uprist,° then wol they sprede.°
But ye lovers, that lie in any drede,°
Fleeth, lest wikked tonges yow espie;
Lo! yond the son, the candel of Jelosie!
 
With teres blewe,° and with a wounded herte
Taketh your leve; and, with Seint John to borow,°
Apeseth° somwhat of your sorowes smerte,
Time cometh° eft,° that cese shal your sorow;
The glade night is worth an hevy morow!—
Seint Valentine: a foul° thus herde I singe
Upon thy day, er sonne gan up springe.
 
Yet° sang this foul—"I rede° yow al awake,
And ye, that han not chosen in humble wise,
Without repenting° cheseth yow your make.°
And ye, that han ful chosen as I devise,°
Yet at this fest renoveleth° your servise
Confermeth it perpetuely to dure,°
And paciently taketh your aventure.°
 
“And for the worship° of this highe feste,
Yet wol I, in my briddes wise,° singe
The sentence° of the compleint, at the leste,
That woful Mars made atte departinge
Fro fresshe Venus in a morweninge,
Whan Phebus, with his firy torches rede,
Ransaked° every lover in his drede.
 
“Whilom° the thridde hevenes lord° above,
As wel by hevenish revolucioun
As by desert,° hath won Venus his love,
And she hath take him in subjeccioun,°
And as a maistres° taught him his lessoun,
Comaunding him that never, in hir servise,
He ner° so bold no° lover to despise.
 
“For she forbad him jelosie at alle,
And cruelte, and bost,° and tirannie;°
She made him at hir lust° so humble in all
That when hir deined° to caste on him her yë,°
He took in pacience to live or die;
And thus she brideleth° him in hir manere,
With nothing but with scourging° of hir chere.°
 
“Who regneth now in blisse but Venus,
That hath this worthy knight in governaunce?
Who singeth now but Mars, that serveth thus
The faire Venus, causer of plesaunce?
He bint him° to perpetual obeisaunce,°
And she bint hir to loven him for ever,
But so be° that his trespas hit dissever.°
 
“Thus be they knit,° and regnen as in heven
By loking most; til hit fil° on a tide°
That by her bothe assent° was set a steven,°
That Mars shal entre, as fast as he may glide,
Into hir nexte paleis,° forto abide,
Walkinge° his cours til she had him atake,°
And he preide her to haste her° for his sake.
 
“Then seide he thus—‘min hertes lady swete,
Ye knowe wel my mischefe° in that place;
For sikerly,° til that I with yow mete,
My lif stant ther in aventure and grace;°
But when I see the beaute of your face,
Ther is no dreed of deth may do me smerte,°
For al your lust° is ese to min herte.ʼ
 
“She hath so gret compassion of her knight,
That dwelleth in solitude til she come;°
For hit stood so, that ilke° time, no wight°
Counseiled him, ne seid to him welcome,
That nigh her wit for wo was overcome;
Wherfor she spedde her as faste in her weye,
Almost in oon day, as he did in tweye.°
 
“The grete joy that was betwix° hem two,
Whan they be met, ther may no tunge telle,
Ther is no more, but unto bed they go,
And thus in joy and blisse I let° hem dwelle;
This worthy Mars, that is of knighthod welle,°
The flour of fairnes lappeth° in his armes,
And Venus kisseth Mars, the god of armes.
 
“Sojourned hath this Mars, of which I rede,°
In chambre° amid the paleis prively
A certein time, til him fel a drede,°
Throgh Phebus,° that was comen° hastely
Within the paleis-yates° sturdely,°
With torche in honde, of which the stremes° brighte
On Venus chambre knokkeden° ful lighte.°
 
“The chambre, ther as° lay this fresshe° quene,
Depeinted was with white boles° grete,
And by the light she knew, that shoon so shene,°
That Phebus cam to bren hem° with his hete;
This sely° Venus, dreint° in teres wete,
Enbraceth Mars, and seide, ‘Alas! I die!
The torch is com, that al this world wol wrie.’°
 
“Up sterte° Mars, him liste not° to slepe,
Whan he his lady herde so compleine;
But, for° his nature was not for to wepe,
In stede of teres, from his eyen tweine
The firy sparkes brosten° out for peine;
And hente° his hauberk,° that lay him beside;
Flee wolde he not, ne might himselven hide.
 
“He throweth on his helm° of huge wight,°
And girte him with his swerde; and in his honde
His mighty spere, as he was wont to fight,
He shaketh so that almost hit towonde;°
Ful hevy° he was to walken over londe;
He may not hold with Venus companie,
But bad her fleen, lest Phebus her espie.
 
“O woful Mars! alas! what mayst thou seyn,
That in the paleis of thy disturbaunce°
Art left behinde, in peril to be slein?
And yet therto is double thy penaunce,°
For she, that hath thin herte in governaunce,
Is passed half the stremes° of thin ÿen;
That thou ner° swift, wel mayst thou wepe and cryen.
 
“Now fleeth Venus unto Cilenius tour,°
With voide° cours, for fere of Phebus light.
Alas! and ther ne hath she no socour,
For she ne found ne° saw no maner wight;°
And eke as ther she had but litil might;
Wherfor, hirselven for to hide and save,
Within the gate she fled into a cave.
 
“Derk was this cave, and smoking as the helle,°
Not but° two paas° within the gate hit stood;
A naturel day in derk I lete her dwelle.
Now wol I speke of Mars, furiouse and wood;°
For sorow he wolde have seen his herte blood;°
Sith that he might her don no companie,
 
“He ne roghte° not a mite° for to die.
So feble he wex,° for hete and for his wo,
That nigh he swelt,° he mighte unnethe° endure;
He passeth but a steire° in dayes two,
But ner the les,° for al° his hevy armure,
He foloweth her that is his lives cure;°
For whos departing he took gretter ire°
Then° for al his brenning in the fire.
 
“After he walketh softely° a pas,°
Compleining, that hit pite was to here.
He seide, ‘O lady bright, Venus! alas!
That ever so wide a compas° is my spere!°
Alas! whan shal I mete yow, herte dere,
This twelfte day of April I endure,
Through jelous Phebus, this misaventure.ʼ
 
“Now God help sely° Venus al allone!
But, as God wolde, hit happed for to be,
That, whil that Venus weping made her mone,°
Cilenius,° riding in his chevache,°
Fro Venus valauns° mighte his paleis see,
And Venus he salueth,° and maketh chere,°
And her receiveth as his frend ful dere.
 
“Mars dwelleth forth° in his adversite,
Compleining ever on her departinge;
And what his compleint was, remembreth me;
And therfore, in this lusty° morweninge,
As I best can, I wol hit seyn and singe,
And after that I wol my leve take;
And God yeve every wight° joye of his make!"°

The ordre° of compleint° requireth° skilfully,°
That if a wight° shal pleine° pitously,°
Ther mot be cause wherfor that men pleine;
Or men may deme° he pleineth folily°
And causeles; alas! that am not I!
Wherfor° the ground and cause of al my peine,
So as° my troubled wit° may hit ateine,°
I wol reherse; not for to have redresse,
But to declare my ground of hevinesse.

“The firste time, alas! that I was wroght,°
And for certein effectes hider° broght
By him that lordeth° ech intelligence,°
I yaf my trewe servise and my thoght,
For evermore—how dere° I have hit boght!—
To hir, that° is of so gret excellence,
That what° wight that first sheweth his presence,°
When she is wrothe and taketh of him no cure,°
He may not longe in joye of love endure.
 
“This is no feined° mater that I telle;
My lady is the verrey sours° and welle
Of beaute, lust, fredam,° and gentilnesse,
Of riche aray°—how dere° men hit selle!—
Of al disport° in which men frendly dwelle,
Of love and pley, and of benigne humblesse,
Of soune of instruments of al swetnesse;
And therto so wel fortuned and thewed,°
That through the worlde her goodnesse is yshewed.
 
“What wonder is then, thogh that I beset°
My servise on such oon, that may me knet°
To wele° or wo, sith hit lithe° in her might?
Therfor my hert for ever I to her het;°
Ne truly, for my dethe, I shal not let°
To ben her trewest servaunt and her knight.
I flater noght, that may wete° every wight;
For this day in her servise shal I die;
But grace be,° I see her never with yë.°
 
“To whom shal I than pleine of my distresse?
Who may me help, who may my harm redresse?
“Shal I compleine unto my lady free?
Nay, certes! for she hath such hevinesse,
For fere and eek for wo, that, as I gesse,
In litil time hit wol° her bane° be.
But were she sauf,° hit wer no fors of me.°
Alas! that ever lovers mote endure
For love so many a perilouse aventure!
 
“For tho so be° that lovers be as trewe°
As eny metal that is forged newe,
In many a cas hem tideth° ofte sorowe.
Somtime her ladies will not on hem rewe,°
Somtime, yif that jelosie hit knewe,°
They mighten lightly leye her hed to borowe;°
Somtime envious folk with tunges horowe°
Depraven° hem; alas! whom may they plese?
But° he be fals, no lover hath his ese.°
 
“But what availeth° suche a long sermoun
Of aventures of love, up and doun?
I wol returne and speken of my peine;
The point is this of my destruccioun,
My righte lady, my savacioun,
Is in affray,° and not° to whom to pleine.
O herte swete, O lady sovereine!
For your disese,° wel oghte I swone and swelt,°
Thogh I none other harm ne drede felt.
 
“To what fin° made the God that sit so hye,
Benethen him, love other companie,°
And streineth° folk to love, malgré her hede?°
And then her joy, for oght I can espie,
Ne lasteth not the twinkling of an yë,
And som han never joy til they be dede.
What meneth this? what is this mistihede?°
Wherto constreineth° he his folk so faste°
Thing to desire, but° hit shulde laste?
 
“And thogh he made a lover love a thing,
And maketh hit seme stedfast° and during,°
Yet putteth he in hit such misaventure,
That reste nis ther noon in his yeving.°
And that is wonder, that so juste a king
Doth such hardnesse° to his creature.
Thus, whether love breke or elles dure,
Algates° he that hath with love to done°
Hath ofter° wo then changed is the mone.°
 
“Hit semeth he hath to lovers enmité,°
And like a fissher,° as men alday may see,
Baiteth his angle-hook° with som plesaunce,
Til mony a fish is wood° til that he be
Sesed° therwith; and then at erst hath he
Al his desir, and therwith al mischaunce;
And thogh° the line breke, he hath penaunce;
For with the hoke he wounded is so sore,
That he his wages° hath for evermore.
 
“The broche of Thebes was of such a kinde,
So ful of rubies and of stones of Inde,°
That every wight, that sette on hit an ye°,
He wend° anon° to worthe° out of his minde;
So sore° the beaute wold his herte binde,
Til he hit had, him thoght he moste dye;
And whan that hit was his, than shuld he drie°
Such wo for drede, ay whil that he hit hadde,
That welnigh for the fere he shulde madde.°
 
“And whan hit was fro his possessioun,
Than had he double wo and passioun
For he so fair a tresor had forgo;°
But yet this broche, as in conclusioun,
Was not the cause of this confusioun;
But he that wroght hit enfortuned hit° so
That every wight that had hit shuld have wo;
And therfore in the worcher° was the vice,
And in the covetour° that° was so nice.°
 
“So fareth hit by lovers and by me;
For thogh my lady have so gret beaute,
That I was mad° til I had gete her grace,°
She was not cause of min adversite,
But he that wroght hir, also mot I thee,°
That putte suche a beaute in her face,
That made me to covete° and purchace
Min owne deth; him wite° I that I die,
And min unwit,° that ever I clomb so hye.
 
“But to yow, hardy knightes of renoun,
Sin that ye be of my divisioun,°
Al be I not worthy so grete a name,
Yet, seyn these clerkes, I am your patroun;°
Therfor ye oght have som compassioun
Of my disese, and take it noght agame.°
The proudest of yow may be mad ful tame;°
Wherfore I prey yow, of your gentilesse,
That ye compleine for min hevinesse.
 
“And ye, my ladies, that ben true and stable,°
Be° wey of kind,° ye oghten to be able
To have pite of folk that be in peine:
Now have ye cause to clothe yow in sable;°
Sith that your emperise,° the honorable,
Is desolat, wel oghte ye to pleine;
Now shuld your holy teres falle and reine.°
Alas! your honour and your emperise,
Negh° ded for drede, ne can her not chevise.°
 
“Compleineth eek, ye lovers, al infere°
For her that, with unfeined humble chere,°
Was ever redy to do yow socour;
Compleineth her° that ever hath had° yow dere;
Compleineth beaute, fredom, and manere;
Compleineth her that endeth your labour;
Compleineth thilke ensample of al honour,
That never did but alle gentilesse;
Kitheth° therfor on her° som kindenesse.”
