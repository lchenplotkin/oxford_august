Flee fro the prees,° and dwell with sothfastnesse,°
Suffice unto° thy good,° though hit be smal;
For horde° hath° hate, and climbing tikelnesse,°
Prees hathe envie, and wel° blent° overal;°
Savour° no more than thee bihove° schal;
Reul° wel thiself, that° other folk canst rede;°
And trouthe° schal delivere,° it is no drede.°
 
Tempest thee° nought al croked° to redresse,
In trust of hir° that turneth as a bal:
Gret reste stant° in litel besinesse;
And ek be war° to sporne° agein an al;°
Strive noght, as doth the crokke° with the wal.
Daunt° thyself, that dauntest otheres dede;°
And trouthe shal delivere, hit is no drede.
 
That° thee is sent, receive in buxhumnesse,°
The wrestling for this worlde axeth° a fal.
Her nis non° hoom, her nis but wildernesse:
Forth,° pilgrim, forth! Forth, beste,° out of thy stal!
Know thi contre, look up, thank God of al;
Hold the high way, and lat thi gost° thee lede:
And trouthe shal delivere, hit is no drede.
 
Therfor, thou Vache, leve° thine old° wrecchednesse°
Unto the worlde; leve now to be thral;°
Crie him mercy, that of his hy goodnesse
Made thee of noght,° and in especial
Drawe unto° him, and pray in general
For thee, and eek for other,° hevenlich mede;°
And trouthe schal delivere, hit is no drede.
