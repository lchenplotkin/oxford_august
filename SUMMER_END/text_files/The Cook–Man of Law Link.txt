¶Our Hoste sey° wel that the brighte sonne
The ark° of his artificial day° had ronne
The fourthe part, and half an houre, and more;
And though he were not depe ystert° in lore,
He wiste° it was the eightetethe° day
Of April, that is messager to May;
And sey° wel that the shadwe of every tree
Was as in lengthe the same quantitee
That was the body erect that caused it.
And therfor by the shadwe he took his wit°
That Phebus,° which that shoon so clere and brighte,
Degrees was five and fourty clombe on highte;
And for that day, as in that latitude,
It was ten of the clokke, he gan conclude,
And sodeinly he plighte° his hors aboute.

¶“Lordinges,” quod he, “I warne° yow, al this route,°
The fourthe party of this day is goon;°
Now, for the love of God and of Seint John,
Leseth° no time, as ferforth as ye may;°
Lordinges, the time wasteth° night and day,
And steleth from us, what prively slepinge,
And what° thurgh necligence in our wakinge,
As dooth the streem, that turneth never again,
Descending fro the montaigne into plain.
Wel can° Senek, and many a philosophre
Biwailen° time, more than gold in cofre.°
‘For los of catel° may recovered be,
But los of time shendeth° us,’ quod he.
It wol nat come again, withouten drede,°
Na more than wol Malkins maidenhede,°
Whan she hath lost it in hir wantownesse;°
Lat us nat moulen° thus in idelnesse.

¶“Sir Man of Lawe,” quod he, “so have ye blis,°
Tel us a tale anon,° as forward° is;
Ye been submitted° thurgh your free assent
To stonde in this cas° at my jugement.
Acquiteth° yow, and holdeth your biheste,°
Than have ye doon your devoir° atte leste.”°

¶“Hoste,” quod he, “depardieux° ich° assente;
To breke forward° is not min entente.
Biheste° is dette, and I wol holde fain°
Al my biheste; I can no better seyn.°
For swich lawe as man yeveth° another wight,°
He sholde himselven usen it by right;°
Thus wol° our text; but natheles certein
I can right now no thrifty° tale seyn,
But Chaucer, though° he can but lewedly°
On° metres and on riming craftily,°
Hath seid° hem in swich English as he can
Of olde time,° as knoweth many a man.
And if he have not seid hem, leve° brother,
In o° book, he hath seid hem in another.
For he hath told of loveres up and doun°
Mo° than Ovide made of mencioun
In his Epistelles, that been ful olde.
What° sholde I tellen hem, sin° they ben tolde?
In youthe he made° of Ceys° and Alcion,°
And sithen° hath he spoke of everichon,°
Thise noble wives and thise loveres eek.
Whoso that wol his large volume seek
Cleped° the Seintes Legende of Cupide,
Ther may he seen the large woundes wide
Of Lucresse, and of Babilan° Tisbee;°
The swerd of Dido for the false Enee;°
The tree of Phillis for hir Demophon;
The pleinte° of Dianire and Hermion,
Of Adriane° and of Isiphilee;°
The bareine° ile stonding in the see;
The dreinte° Leander for his Erro;°
The teres of Eleine,° and eek° the wo
Of Brixseide,° and of thee, Ladomëa;°
The crueltee of thee, queen Medëa,
Thy litel children hanging by the hals°
For thy Jason, that was of love so fals!
O Ypermistra,° Penelopee, Alceste,
Your wifhod he comendeth with the beste!
But certeinly no word ne writeth he
Of thilke wikke° ensample of Canacee,
That lovede hir owne brother sinfully;
Of swiche cursed stories I sey ‘fy’;
Or elles of Tyro Apollonius,
How that the cursed king Antiochus
Birafte° his doghter of hir maidenhede,°
That is so horrible a tale for to rede,
Whan he hir threw upon the pavement.
And therfor he, of ful avisement,°
Nolde° never write in none of his sermouns°
Of swiche unkinde° abhominaciouns,
Ne I wol noon reherse, if that I may.

¶But of my tale how shal I doon this day?
Me were looth° be likned,° doutelees,
To Muses that men clepe° Pierides—
Metamorphoseos wot what I mene:—
But nathelees, I recche noght a bene°
Though I come after him with hawebake;°
I speke in prose, and lat him rimes make.”
And with that word he, with a sobre chere,
Bigan his tale, as ye shal after here.
