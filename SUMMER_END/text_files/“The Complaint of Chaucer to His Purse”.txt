To you, my purse, and to noon other wight°
Complein I, for ye be my lady dere!
I am so sory, now that ye be light;°
For certes, but ye make° me hevy° chere,°
Me were as leef be° laide upon my bere;°
For whiche unto your mercy thus I crie:
Beth hevy ayeine, or elles mote° I die!
 
Now voucheth sauf° this day, or° hit be night,
That I of you the blisful soun° may here,
Or see your colour lik the sonne bright,
That of yelownesse hadde never pere.°
Ye be my lif, ye be min hertes stere,°
Quene of comfort and of good companie:
Beth hevy ayeine, or elles mot I die!
Now purs, that be to me my lives light,°
And saveour,° as doun in this world here,
Out of this toune help me through your might,
Sin° that ye wol nat been my tresorere;°
For I am shave as nie° as any frere.°
But yet I pray unto your curtesie:
Beth hevy agein, or elles moote I die!

O conquerour of Brutes Albioun!°
Which that by line° and free eleccion
Ben verray king, this song to you I sende;
And ye, that mowen all our harme amende,
Have minde upon my supplicacion!
