¶“Weping and wailing, care, and other sorwe
I know ynogh, on even° and amorwe,”°
Quod the Marchaunt, “and so don other mo°
That° wedded been, I trow° that it be so.
For, wel I woot,° it fareth so° with me.
I have a wif, the worste that may be;
For thogh the feend° to hir ycoupled° were,
She wolde him overmacche,° I dar wel swere.
What° sholde I yow reherce in special°
Hir hie malice? she is a shrewe at al.°
Ther is a long and large difference
Bitwix° Grisildis grete pacience
And of my wif the passing° crueltee.
Were I unbounden,° also moot I thee!°
I wolde never eft° comen in the snare.
We wedded men live in sorwe and care;
Assaye° whoso° wol, and he shal finde
I seye sooth, by Seint Thomas of Inde,
As° for the more° part, I sey nat alle.
God shilde° that it sholde so bifalle!°

¶A! good sir Hoost! I have ywedded be°
Thise monthes two, and more nat,° pardee;°
And yet, I trowe, he that all his live
Wiflees hath been, though that men wolde him rive°
Unto the herte, ne coude° in no manere°
Tellen° so muchel sorwe, as I now here
Coud tellen of my wives cursednesse!”°

¶“Now,” quod our Hoost, “Marchaunt, so God yow blesse,
Sin ye so muchel° knowen of that art,
Ful hertely° I pray yow telle us part.”
“Gladly,” quod he, “but of min owne sore,°
For sory herte, I telle may namore.”
