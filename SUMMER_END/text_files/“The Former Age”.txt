A blisful° lif, a paisible° and swete
Ledden° the poeples in the former° age;
They helde hem paied of° fructes,° that they ete,
Which that the feldes yave° hem by usage;°
They ne were nat forpampred° with outrage;°
Onknowin° was the quern° and eek the melle;°
They eten maste,° hawes,° and swich pounage,°
And dronken° water of the colde welle.°
 
Yit nas° the ground nat wounded with the plouh,°
But corn° upsprong,° unsowe° of° mannes hond,
The which° they gnodde,° and eet nat half inouh°
No man yit knew the forwes° of his lond;
No man the fir out of the flint yit fond;°
Unkorven° and ungrobbed° lay the vine;
No man yit in the morter° spices grond°
To° clarre,° ne to sause of galentine.°
 
No madir, welde, or wood° no litestere°
Ne knew;° the flees° was of his former° hewe;
No flesh° ne wiste° offence° of egge° or spere;
No coin ne knew man which was fals° or trewe;
No ship yit karf° the wawes° grene and blewe;
No marchaunt yit ne fette° outlandissh° ware;°
No trompes° for the werres° folk ne knewe,
No towres heye°, and walles rounde or square.
 
What sholde it han availed° to werreie?°
Ther lay no profit, ther was no richesse,°
But cursed was the time, I dar wel° seye,
That men first dede hir swety° bisinesse°
To grobbe° up metal, lurkinge° in derknesse,
And in the riveres firste gemmis° soghte.
Allas! than sprong up al the cursidnesse
Of covetise,° that first our sorwe° brouhte!
 
Thise tiraunts putte hem gladly nat in pres,°
No places wildness,° ne busshes° for to winne°
Ther° poverte is, as seith Diogenes,
Ther as° vitaile° is eek so skars° and thinne
That nat° but mast° or apples is therinne.
But, ther as° bagges° been and fat vitaile,°
Ther wol they gon, and spare for no sinne°
With al hir ost° the cite for tʼassaile.°
 
Yit were° no paleis° chaumbres,° ne non halles;
In caves and in wodes° softe and swete
Slepten° this blissed° folk withoute walles,
On gras or leves in parfit° quiete.
No down of fetheres, ne no bleched° shete
Was kid° to hem, but in surtee° they slepte;
Hir hertes were al oon,° withoute galles,°
Everich° of hem his feith° to other kepte.
 
Unforged was the hauberke° and the plate;°
The lambissh° poeple, void° of alle vice,
Hadden no fantasye° to debate,
But eche of hem wolde other wel cherice;°
No pride, non envie, ne non avarice,
No lord, no tailage° by no tirannie;
Humblesse° and pees, good feith, the emperice,°
 
Yit was nat Juppiter the likerous,°
That first was fader of delicacie,°
Come in this world; ne Nembrot,° desirous°
To reinen,° had nat maad his toures° hie.
Allas, allas! now may men wepe and crie!
For in our dayes nis but° covetise°
And doublenesse,° and tresoun and envie,
Poisoun, manslauhtre, and mordre in sondry wise.°
