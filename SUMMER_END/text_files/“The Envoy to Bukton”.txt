My maister Bukton, whan of Criste our kinge
Was axed,° what is trouthe or sothfastnesse,°
He nat a word answerd to that axinge
As who saith:° “No man is al trewe,” I gesse.
And therfor, thogh I highte° to expresse
The sorwe and wo that is in mariage,
I dar not write of hit no° wikkednesse,°
Leste I myself falle eft° in swich dotage.°
 
I wol nat seyn, how that hit is the cheine
Of Sathanas, on which he gnaweth evere,
But I dar seyn, were he° oute of his peine,
As by his wille, he wold be bounde nevere.
But thilke° doted° fool that eft hath levere°
Ycheined be than out of prison crepe,
God lete him never fro his wo dissevere,°
Ne no man him bewaile, though he wepe.
 
But yet, lest thou do worse, take a wife;
Bet is to wedde, than brenne° in worse wise.
But thou shalt have sorwe on thy flesh, thy life,°
And ben thy wifes thral, as seyn these wise,°
And if that holy writ may nat suffise,
Experience shal thee teche, so may happe,°
That thee were lever to be take° in Frise°
Than eft to falle of weddinge in the trappe.

This litel writ,° proverbes, or figure°
I sende you, tak kepe of° hit, I rede:°
Unwise is he that can no wele endure.°
If thou be siker,° put thee nat in drede.°
The Wife of Bathe I pray you that ye rede
Of this matere that we have on honde.
God graunte you your lif frely to lede
In fredom; for ful hard is to be bonde.°
