Som time° the world was so stedfast° and stable
That mannes word° was obligacion,
And nowe it is so fals and deseivable,°
That worde and dede, as in conclusion,°
Ben nothing lik,° for turned up so doun
Is al this world for° mede° and wilfulnesse,°
That al is lost for lak of stedfastnesse.°
 
What maketh this world to be so variable
But° lust° that folke have in dissension?°
For among us now a man is holde° unable,°
But yif° he can, by som conclusion,°
Do his neighburgh wrong or oppression.°
What causeth this, but wilful° wrecchednesse,°
That al is lost, for lak of stedfastnesse?
 
Trouthe° is put doun, resoun is holden fable;°
Vertu hath now no dominacion,°
Pitee exiled, no man is merciable.°
Through covetise° is blent° discrecion;°
The worlde hath made a permutacioun°
Fro right to wrong, fro trouth to fikelnesse,
That al is lost, for lak of stedfastnesse.

O Prince, desire to be honurable,°
Cherish thy folk and hate extorcioun!°
Suffre° no thing, that may be reprevable°
To thine estat,° doen° in thy regioun.°
Shew forth° thy swerde of castigacioun,°
Dred° God, do law,° love truthe and worthinesse,
And wed° thy folk ayen° to stedfastnesse.
