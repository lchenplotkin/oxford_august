¶“Wel seid, by corpus dominus,”° quod our Hoste,
“Now longe moot° thou saile by the coste,
Sir gentil maister, gentil marineer!
God yeve° this monk a thousand last quad yeer!°
A ha! felaws! beth ware of swiche a jape!°
The monk putte in the mannes hood an ape,°
And in his wives eek, by Seint Austin!°
Draweth no monkes moore unto your in.°

¶But now passe over, and lat us seke aboute,
Who shal now telle first, of al this route,°
Another tale”; and with that word he saide,
As curteisly as it° had been a maide,°
“My lady Prioresse, by your leve,
So that° I wiste° I sholde yow nat greve,°
I wolde demen° that ye tellen sholde
A tale next, if so were° that ye wolde.
Now wol ye vouchesauf,° my lady dere?”
¶“Gladly,” quod she, and seide as ye shal here.
