¶Whan ended was the lif of Seint Cecile,
Er° we had riden fully five mile,
At Boghton under Blee us gan atake°
A man, that clothed was in clothes blake,
And under that he had a whit surplis.°
His hakeney,° that was al pomely° gris,°
So swatte,° that it wonder was to see;
It semed he had priked° miles three.
The hors eek that his yeman° rood upon
So swatte, that unnethe° mighte it gon.
About the peitrel° stood the foom ful hie,
He was of foom as flekked° as a pie.°
A male tweifold° on his croper° lay,
It semed that he caried lite° array.°
Al light° for somer rood this worthy man,
And in min herte wondren I bigan
What that he was, til that I understood
How that° his cloke was sowed° to his hood;
For which,° when I had longe avised° me,
I demed him som chanoun° for to be.
His hat heng at his bak doun by a laas,°
For he had riden more than trot or paas;°
He hadde ay priked lik as he were wood.°
A clote leef° he hadde under his hood
For swoot,° and for to kepe his heed from hete.
But it was joye for to seen him swete!
His forheed dropped as a stillatorie,°
Were ful of plantain° and of paritorie.°
And whan that he was come, he gan to crie,
“God save,” quod he, “this joly compaignie!
Faste have I priked,” quod he, “for your sake,
Bicause that I wolde yow atake,
To riden in this mirie companie.”
His yeman eek was ful of curteisie,
And seide, “Sirs, now in the morwetide°
Out of youre hostelrie° I saugh you ride,
And warned° heer my lord and my soverain,°
Which° that to riden with yow is ful fain,°
For his desport;° he loveth daliaunce.”°

¶“Freend, for thy warning God yeve thee good chaunce,”°
Than seide our Host, “for certes, it wold seme
Thy lord wer wis, and so I may wel deme;°
He is ful jocunde° also, dar I leye.°
Can he oght° telle a mirie tale or tweye,
With which he glade° may this compaignie?”

¶“Who, sir? my lord? ye, ye, withouten lie,
He can of° murthe, and eek of jolitee
Nat but ynough;° also sir, trusteth me,
And° ye him knewe as wel as do I,
Ye wolde wondre how wel and craftily°
He coude werke, and that in sondry wise.°
He hath take on him many a greet emprise,°
Which were° ful hard for any° that is here
To bringe about, but° they of° him it lere.°
As homly° as he rit° amonges yow,
If ye him knewe, it wold be for your prow;°
Ye wolde nat forgoon° his aqueintaunce
For° muchel good,° I dar leye in balaunce°
Al that I have in my possessioun.
He is a man of heigh discrecioun,
I warn° you wel, he is a passing° man.”

¶“Wel,” quod our Host, “I pray thee, tel me than,
Is he a clerk,° or noon?° tel what he is.”
“Nay, he is gretter than a clerk, ywis,”
Seid this Yeman, “and in wordes fewe,
Host, of his craft somwhat I wol yow shewe.

¶“I say, my lord can° swich subtilitee°—
(But al his craft ye may nat wite at° me;
And° somwhat helpe I yet to° his werking)—
That al this ground on which we been riding,
Til that we com to Caunterbury toun,
He coude al clene° turne it up-so-doun,
And pave it al of silver and of gold.”

¶And whan this Yeman had this tale ytold
Unto our Host, he seide, “Benedicite!°
This thing is wonder° merveillous to me,
Sin that thy lord is of so heigh° prudence,°
Bicause of which men sholde him reverence,
That of his worship° rekketh° he so lite;°
His oversloppe° nis nat° worth a mite,
As in effect,° to him, so moot I go!°
It is al baudy° and totore° also.
Why is thy lord so sluttish,° I thee preye,
And is of power° better cloth to beye,°
If that his dede accorde° with thy speche?
Tel me that, and that I thee biseche.”

¶“Why?” quod this Yeman, “Wherto° ax ye° me?
God help me so, for he shal never thee!°
(But I wol nat avowe° that° I seye,
And therfor kepe it secree, I yow preye).
He is to wis, in feith, as I bileve;
That that° is overdoon,° it wol nat preve°
Aright, as clerkes seyn, it is a vice.
Wherfore in that I holde him lewed° and nice.°
For whan a man hath overgreet a wit,°
Ful oft him happeth° to misusen it;
So dooth my lord, and that me greveth sore.°
God it amende, I can sey yow namore.”

¶“Therof no fors,° good Yeman,” quod our Host;
“Sin of the conning° of thy lord thou wost,°
Tel how he dooth, I pray thee hertely,
Sin that he is so crafty° and so sly.°
Wher dwelle ye, if it to telle be?”°
“In the suburbes of a toun,” quod he,
“Lurkinge in hernes° and in lanes blinde,°
Wheras thes robbours and thes theves by kinde°
Holden hir privee° ferful° residence,
As they that dar nat shewen hir presence;
So faren we,° if I shal sey the sothe.”°

¶“Now,” quod our Host, “yit° lat me talk to the;
Why artow so discoloured of thy face?”
“Peter!”° quod he, “God yeve° it harde grace,°
I am so used° in the fir° to blowe,
That it hath chaunged my colour, I trowe.°
I am nat wont° in no mirour to prie,°
But swinke sore° and lerne multiplie.°
We blondren° evere and pouren in° the fir,
And for al that° we faille° of our desir,
For ever we lacken our conclusioun.
To muchel° folk we doon illusioun,°
And borwe gold, be it a pound or two,
Or ten, or twelve, or manie sommes° mo,°
And make hem wenen,° at the leeste weye,°
That of a° pound we coude make tweye!°
Yet is it fals, but ay we han° good hope
It for to doon,° and after it° we grope.°
But that science is so fer us biforn,°
We mowen° nat, although we hadde it sworn,
It overtake,° it slit° awey so faste;
It wole us maken beggers atte laste.”°

¶Whil this Yeman was thus in his talking,
This Chanoun drough him° neer, and herde al thing°
Which that° this Yeman spak, for suspecioun°
Of mennes speche evere had this Chanoun.
For Catoun seith, that he that gilty is
Demeth° al thing be spoke of him,° ywis.°
That was the cause he gan so ny° him drawe
To his Yeman, to herknen° al his sawe.°
And thus he seide unto his Yeman tho,
“Hold thou thy pees,° and spek no wordes mo,
For if thou do, thou shalt it dere abie;°
Thou sclaundrest° me heer in this compaignie,
And eek discoverest° that° thou sholdest hide.”
“Ye,” quod our Host, “telle on, what so° bitide;°
Of al his threting° rekke nat a mite!”°
“In feith,” quod he, “namore I do but lite.”°

¶And whan this Chanon saugh it wold nat be,
But his Yeman wold telle his privetee,°
He fledde awey for verray sorwe° and shame.
“A!” quod the Yeman, “heer shal arise game,°
Al that I can° anon° now wol I telle,
Sin he is goon, the foule feend him quelle!°
For never herafter wol I with him mete
For peny ne for pound,° I yow bihete!°
He that me broghte first unto that game,°
Er that° he die, sorwe have he and shame!
For it is ernest to me,° by my feith;
That fele I wel, what so° any man seith.
And yet, for al my smert° and al my grief,
For al my sorwe, labour, and meschief,°
I coude never leve it° in no wise.
Now wolde God° my wittes might suffise
To tellen al that longeth° to that art!°
But natheles° yow wol I tellen part;
Sin that my lord is gon, I wol nat spare;°
Swich thing as that I knowe, I wol declare.—
