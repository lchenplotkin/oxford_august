This wrecched worldis transmutacioun,°
As° wele° or wo,° poverte and now° honour,°
Withouten ordre or wis° discrecioun°
Governed is by Fortunes hie errour;°
But natheles,° the lakke of hir favour
Ne may nat don me singen,° thowh I die,
Jay tout perdu mon temps et mon labour;°
For finally, Fortune, I thee defie!
 
Yit° is me° left the liht of my resoun,
To knowen frend fro° fo in thy mirrour.
So° muche hath yit thy whirlinge up and doun
Itawht° me for to knowen in an hour.°
But trewely, no force° of thy reddowr°
To° him that over himself hath the maistrie!°
My suffisaunce° shal be my socour:
For finally, Fortune, I thee defie!
 
O Socrates, thou stidfast° champioun,
She never mighte be thy tormentowr;
Thou never dreddest° hir oppressioun,°
Ne° in hir chere° found thou no savour.°
Thow knewe wel deceit° of hir colour,°
And that hir moste worshipe° is to lie.
I knowe hir eek° a fals dissimulour:°
For finally, Fortune, I thee defie!
 
La respounse de Fortune au Pleintif°
 
No man is wrecched, but° himself hit wene,°
And he that hath himself° hath suffisaunce.
Why seysthow° thanne I am to thee so kene,°
That° hast° thyself owt of my governaunce?°
Sey thus: “Graunt mercy° of thin haboundaunce°
That thou hast lent° or° this.” Why wolt thou strive?
What wost thow° yit,° how I thee wol avaunce?°
And eek° thou hast thy beste frende alive!
 
I have thee tawht divisioun° bitwene
Frend of effect,° and frende of countenaunce;°
Thee nedeth nat° the galle° of noon hyene,°
That cureth eyen° derk° fro hir penaunce;°
Now seesthow° cleer, that were° in ignoraunce.
Yit° halt° thin ancre,° and yit thou mayst arrive
Ther° bountee° berth° the keye of my substaunce:°
And eek thou hast thy beste frende alive.
 
How many have I refused to sustene,
Sin I thee fostred have in thy plesaunce!
Wolthow than make a statute° on° thy qweene
That I shal ben ay at thin ordinaunce?°
Thou born art in my regne° of variaunce,
About the wheel with other° most thow drive.°
My lore° is bet than wikke° is thy grevaunce,°
And eek thou hast thy beste frend alive.
 
La respounce du Pleintif countre Fortune°
 
Thy lore° I dampne,° hit is adversitee.°
My frend maysthow nat° reven,° blind goddesse!
That I thy frendes knowe, I thanke it thee.°
Tak hem again,° lat hem° go lie on presse!°
The negardie° in keping hir richesse°
Prenostik is° thou wolt° hir towr asaile;°
Wikke° appetit comth° ay befor seknesse:°
In general, this rewle° may nat faile.
 
La respounse de Fortune countre le pleintif °
 
Thou pinchest at° my mutabilite,°
For° I thee lente° a drope of my richesse,°
And now me liketh° to withdrawe me.°
Why sholdisthow° my realtee° oppresse?°
The see° may ebbe and flowen more or lesse;
The welkne° hath might° to shine, reine,° or haile;
Right so° mot° I kithen° my brotelnesse.°
In general, this rule may nat faile.
 
Lo, thʼexecucion° of the magestee°
That al purveyeth of° his rihtwisnesse,°
That same thing “Fortune" clepen° ye,
Ye blinde beestes,° ful of lewednesse!°
The hevene hath proprete° of sikirnesse,°
This world hath ever resteles° travaile;°
Thy laste day is ende° of min intresse:°
In general, this rule may nat faile.
 
Lenvoy de Fortune°
 
Princes, I prey you of° your gentilesse,°
Lat nat this man on me thus crie and pleine,°
And I shal quite° you your bisinesse°
At my requeste, as three of you or tweine;°
And, but° you list° releve him of his peine,
Preyeth° his beste frend, of his noblesse,°
That to som betere estat° he may atteine.°
