¶“In feith, Squier, thou hast thee wel yquit,°
And gentilly° I preise wel thy wit,”°
Quod the Frankelein, “Considering thy youthe,
So feelingly° thou spekest, sir, I allow’the°
As to my doom,° there is non that is here
Of° eloquence that shal be thy pere,
If that thou live; God yeve° thee good chaunce,°
And in vertu send thee continuaunce!°
For of° thy speche I have greet deintee.°
I have a sone, and, by the Trinitee,
I hadde lever° than twenty pound worth lond,
Though it right now were fallen in min hond,
He° were a man of swich discrecioun°
As that ye been. Fy on possessioun°
But if° a man be vertuous withal.
I have my sone snibbed,° and yet° shal,
For he to vertu listeth nat° entende;°
But for to pleye at dees,° and to despende,°
And lese° al that he hath, is his usage.°
And he hath lever° talken with a page°
Than to comune° with any gentil° wight°
There° he might lerne gentillesse aright.”—

¶“Straw for° your gentillesse,” quod our Host;
“What, Frankelein? pardee,° sir, wel thou wost°
That eche of yow mot° tellen atte leste
A tale or two, or breken his biheste.”°

¶“That knowe I wel, sir,” quod the Frankelein;
“I prey yow, haveth me nat° in desdein
Though to this man I speke a word or two.”

¶“Telle on thy tale withouten wordes mo.”

¶“Gladly, sir Host,” quod he, “I wol obeye
Unto your wil; now herkneth° what I seye.
I wol yow nat contrarien° in no wise
As fer as that my wittes° wol suffise;
I prey to God that it may plesen yow,
Than woot I wel that it is good ynow.”°
