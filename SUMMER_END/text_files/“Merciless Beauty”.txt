Your ÿen° two wol sle° me sodenly,
I may the beaute of them not sustene,°
So woundeth it throughout my herte kene.°
 
And but° your word will helen hastely°
My hertis° wounde, whil that hit is grene,°
    Your ÿen two wol sle me sodenly,
    I may the beaute of them not sustene.
 
Upon my trouth° I sey you° faithfully,
That ye ben° of my life and deth the quene;
For with my deeth the trouthe shal be sene.
    Your yën two wol slee me sodenly,
    I may the beaute of them not sustene,
    So woundeth it throughout my herte kene.

So hath your beaute fro your herte chaced°
Pitee, that me n’availeth not° to plein;°
For Daunger° halt° your mercy in his cheine.
Giltles° my deeth thus han ye me purchaced;°
I sey yow soth°, me nedeth not° to fain;°
    So hath yowr beaute fro your herte chaced
    Pitee, that me nʼavaileth not to pleine.
 
Allas! that nature hath in yow compased°
So greet beaute, that no man may attein
To mercy, though he sterve° for the pein.
    So hath your beaute fro your herte chaced
    Pitee, that me n’availeth not to pleine.
        For Daunger halt your mercy in his cheine.

Sin I fro Love escaped am so fat,
I neʼer thenk to ben in his prison lene;°
Sin° I am free, I counte him not a bene.°
He may answere, and seye this or that;
I do no fors,° I spek right° as I mene.
    Sin I fro Love escaped am so fat,
    I neʼer thenk to ben in his prison lene.
 
Love hath my name istrike° out of his sclat,°
And he is strike out of° my bokes clene°
For evermo; ther is non other mene.°
    Sin I fro Love escaped am so fat,
    I neʼer thenk to ben in his prison lene;
    Sin I am free, I counte him not a bene.
