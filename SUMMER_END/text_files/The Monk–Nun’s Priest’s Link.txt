¶“Ho!”° quod the Knight, “good sir, namore of this,
That° ye han seid is right ynough, ywis,
And mochel° more; for litel hevinesse
Is right ynough to mochel° folk, I gesse.
I sey for me, it is a greet disese°
Wheras° men han ben in greet welthe and ese,
To heren of hir sodein fal, allas!
And the contrarie is joie and greet solas,°
As whan a man hath been in povre estaat,°
And climbeth up, and wexeth° fortunat,
And ther abideth° in prosperitee,
Swich thing is gladsom, as it thinketh me,
And of° swich thing were goodly° for to telle.”

¶“Ye,” quod our Hoste, “by Seint Poules belle,
Ye sey right sooth; this monk, he clappeth° loude,
He spak how fortune covered with a cloude
I noot never° what, and als of ‘Tragedie.’
Right now ye herde, and parde!° no remedie
It is for to biwaille, ne° compleine
That that° is doon, and als° it is a peine,
As ye han seid, to here° of hevinesse.

¶“Sir Monk, namore of this, so God° yow blesse!
Your tale anoyeth° al this companie;
Swich talking is nat worth a boterflie;
For therin is ther no desport° ne game.
Wherfor, sir Monk, or dan Piers by your name,
I prey yow hertely, telle us somwhat° elles,
For sikerly,° nere° clinking of your belles,
That on your bridel hange on every side,
By heven king, that for us alle dide,°
I sholde er this han fallen doun for slepe,
Although the slough° had never been so depe;
Than had your tale al be told in vain.
For certeinly, as that thise clerkes seyn,
‘Wheras° a man may have noon audience,°
Noght helpeth it° to tellen his sentence.’°
And wel I woot the substance° is in me,
If any thing shal wel reported be.
Sir, sey somwhat° of hunting, I yow preye.”
“Nay,” quod this Monk, “I have no lust° to pleye;
Now let another telle, as I have told.”

¶Than spak our Host, with rude° speche and bold,
And seide unto the Nonnes Preest anon,
“Com neer, thou preest, com hider,° thou Sir John,
Tel us swich thing as may our hertes glade,°
Be blithe,° though thou ride upon a jade.°
What though° thin hors be bothe foule° and lene,
If he wol serve thee, rekke nat a bene;°
Look° that thin hert be mery evermo.”

¶“Yis, sir,” quod he, “yis, Host, so mote I go,°
But° I be mery, ywis,° I wol be blamed”:—
And right anon° his tale he hath attamed,°
And thus he seide unto us everichon,
This swete preest, this goodly° man, Sir John.
