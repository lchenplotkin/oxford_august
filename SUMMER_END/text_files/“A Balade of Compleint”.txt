Complein ne koud,° ne° might min herte never°
My peines halve,° ne what turment I have,
Thaugh that° I sholde in your presence ben° ever,°
My hertes lady, as wisly° he° me save
That° bountee° made, and beute list° to grave°
In your persone, and bade hem bothe infeere°
Ever tʼawaite,° and ay° beo° wher ye were.
 
As wisly° he gie° al my joyes here
As I am yours, and to yow sadde° and truwe,
And ye, my lif and cause of my good chere,°
And deeth° also, whan ye my peines newe,°
My worldes joye, whom I wol serve and suwe,°
Min heven hole,° and al my souffisaunce,°
Whom for to serve is sette° al my plesaunce.°
 
Beseching° yowe in my most humble wise°
Tʼaccept in worth° this litel pore dite,°
And for my trouth° my service nat despise,
Min observaunce° eke have nat in despite,°
Ne yit to long to suffren in this plite,°
I yow beseech,° min hertes lady dere,
Sith° I yow serve, and so wil yeer by yere.
