¶“Ey! Goddes mercy!” seide our Hoste tho,
“Now swich a wif I pray God keep° me fro!
Lo, whiche sleightes° and subtilitees°
In wommen been! for ay as bisy as bees
Ben they, us sely° men for to deceive,
And from a sothe° ever wol they weive;°
By this marchauntes tale it preveth weel.°
But doutelees, as trewe as any steel
I have a wif, though that she povre be;
But of hir tonge a labbing° shrewe° is she,
And yet she hath an heep° of vices mo;
Therof no fors,° lat al swiche thinges go.
But, wite ye° what? in conseil° be it seid,
Me reweth° sore I am unto hir teid.
For, and° I sholde rekenen every vice
Which that she hath, ywis, I were to nice,°
And cause why?° It shold reported be
And told to hir of° somme of this meinee;°
Of whom, it nedeth nat for to declare,
Sin wommen connen outen° swich chaffare;°
And eek my wit suffiseth nat therto°
To tellen al; wherfor° my tale is do.”°

¶“Squier, com neer, if it your wille be,
And sey somwhat of° love; for, certes, ye
Connen theron° as muche as any man.”

¶“Nay, sir,” quod he, “but I wol seye as I can
With hertly° wil; for I wol nat rebelle
Again° your lust;° a tale wol I telle.
Have me° excused if I speke amis,
My wil is good; and lo, my tale is this.”
