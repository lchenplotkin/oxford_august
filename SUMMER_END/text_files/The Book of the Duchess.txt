¶I have gret wonder, by this lighte,
How that I live, for day ne nighte
I may nat slepe wel nigh noght;
I have so many an idel° thoght
Purely for defaulte° of slepe,
That, by my trouthe, I tak no kepe°
Of no thing, how it comth or goth,
Ne me nis no thing lief° nor loth.°
Al is iliche° good to me—
Joye or sorow, wherso it be—
For I have feling in no thinge,
But, as it were, a mased° thinge,
Alway in point to° falle adoun;
For sorwful imaginacioun°
Is alway hooly in° my minde.
 
¶And wel ye wote,° againes kinde°
It were to liven in this wise;°
For Nature wolde nat suffise°
Unto noon erthly creature
Not longe time to endure
Withoute slepe, and be in sorwe;
And I ne may, ne night ne morwe,
Slepe; and this melancolie,
And drede I have for to die.
Defaulte of slepe, and hevinesse
Hath slain° my spirit of quiknesse,°
That° I have loste al lustihede.°
Such fantasies ben in min hede
So I not° what is best to do.
 
¶But men might axe° me, why so
I may not slepe, and what me is.°
But natheles, who aske this
Leseth° his asking trewely.
Myselven can not telle why
The soth;° but trewly, as I gesse,
I hold° it be a sikenesse
That I have suffred this eight yere,
And yet my boote° is never the nere;°
For ther is phisicien but° one,
That may me heel; but that is done.°
Pass we over until efte;°
That° wil not be, moot needs° be lefte;
Our first mater° is good to kepe.°
So whan I saw I might° not slepe,
Til now late, this other night,
Upon my bedde I sat upright,
And bade one° reche° me a booke,
A romaunce, and he it me toke°
To rede and drive the night away;°
For me thought it better play°
Then play either at chesse or tables.°
 
¶And in this book were written fables°
That clerkes° had, in olde time,
And other poets, put in rime
To rede, and for to be° in minde
Whil° men loved the lawe of kinde.°
This book ne spak but of° such thinges,
Of quenes lives, and of kinges,
And many other thinges smalle.°
Amonge al this I fonde a tale
That me thought° a wonder thing.
 
¶This was the tale: Ther was a king
That highte° Seys, and had a wife,
The beste that might beare life;°
And this queen highte Alcione.
So it befill,° therafter sone,
This king wol wenden° over see.
To tellen shortly, whan that he
Was in the see, thus in this wise,
Soche a tempest gan to rise
That brak° hir° mast, and made it falle,
And cleft° hir ship, and dreint° hem° alle,
That° never was founden, as it telles,
Bord ne man, ne nothing elles.
Right thus this king Seys loste his lif.
 
¶Now for to speken of his wif:
This lady, that was left at home,
Hath wonder, that the king ne come
Hom, for it was a longe terme.
Anon her herte gan to erme;°
And for that hir thoughte° evermo
It was not wel he dwelte so,
She longed so after the king
That certes, it were a pitous° thing
To telle hir hertly° sorwful life
That she hadde alas, this noble wife;
For him she loved alderbest.
Anon° she sent bothe eest and west
To seke him, but they founde nought.
 
¶“Alas!” quoth she, “That I was wrought!°
And wher° my lord, my love, be deed?
Certes, I nil° never ete breed,
I make a vow to my god here,
But° I mowe of my lorde here!”°
Such sorwe this lady to her toke
That trewly I, which made this boke,
Had such pite and suche rowthe°
To rede° hir sorwe, that, bi my trowthe,
I ferde° the worse al the morwe°
After, to thenken on her sorwe.
 
¶So whan she coud here no word
That no man mighte finde hir lord,
Ful oft she swouned,° and seide “Alas!”
For sorwe ful nigh° wood° she was,
Ne she coude no reed° but oon;
But doun on knees she sat anoon,
And wept, that pite was to here.
 
¶“A mercy, swete ladi dere!”
Quod she to Juno, hir goddesse;
“Help me out of this distresse,
And yeve° me grace my lord to see
Soone, or wit° wher so he be,
Or how he fareth, or in what wise,
And I shal make you sacrifise,
And hooly youres become I shal
With good will, bodi, hert, and al;
And but° thou wilt° this, ladi swete,
Send me grace to slepe, and mete°
In mi sleep som certein sweven,°
Wherthrough that I may knowe even
Whether mi lord be quik° or deed.”
 
¶With that word she heng doun the heed,
And felle aswowne° as cold as ston;
Hir women caught her up anon,
And broghten hir in bed al naked,
And she, forweped° and forwaked,°
Was wery, and thus the dede° slepe
Fil on her, or° she tooke kepe,°
Through Juno, that had herde hir bone,°
That made hir for to slepe sone;
For as she praid, right so was done,
In deed; for Juno, right anone,
Called thus her messagere
To do her erande, and he com nere.
 
¶Whan he was com, she bad him thus:
“Go bet,”° quod Juno, “to Morpheus,
Thou knowest him wel, the god of slepe;
Now understonde, and take kepe.°
Sey thus on mi half,° that he
Go faste° into the grete see,
And bid him that, on alle thinge,
He take up Seys body° the kinge,
That lith° ful pale and nothing rody.°
Bid him crepe into the body,
And do it goon° to Alcione
The quene, ther she lith alone,
And shewe hir shortly,° it is no nay,°
How it was dreint° this other day;
And do the bodi speke° so
Right as it was woned° to do,
The whiles that it was alive.
Go now faste, and hy thee blive!”°
 
¶This messager took leve and went
Upon his wey, and never stent°
Til he com to the derk valeie
That stant bitwene roches tweie
Ther never yet grew corn° ne gras,
Ne tre, ne noght that oughte° was,
Best,° ne man, ne nothing elles,
Sauf° ther were a fewe welles°
Cam renning fro the cliffs adoun,
That made a deedli° sleping soun,°
And ronnen doun right by a cave
That was under a rokke ygrave°
Amid the valey, wonder depe.
Ther these goddis laye and slepe,
Morpheus, and Eclympasteire,
That was the god of slepes eire,°
That slepe° and did non other werke.
 
¶This cave was also as derke
As hell pitte over al aboute;
They had good leiser° for to route°
To envie,° who might slepe beste;
Som henge° her chin upon her breste
And slept upright, her hed yhedde,°
And som lay naked in her bedde,
And slepe whiles the dayes laste.
 
¶This messager com fleying faste,
And cried, “O how! awak anon!”
It was for noght;° ther herde him non.
“Awak!” quod he, “Who is lith there?”
And blew his horn right in her ere,
And cried “Awaketh!” wonder hye.°
This god of sleep, with his oon ye°
Caste up° and axed, “Who clepeth° there?
 
¶“It am I,” quod this messagere;
“Juno bad thow shuldest goon”—
And tolde him what he shulde doon
As I have told yow hertofore;
It is no need reherse° it more;
And went his wey, whan he had saide.
 
¶Anon° this god of slepe abraide°
Out of his slepe, and gan to goon,
And did as he had bede° him doon;
Tooke up the dreinte° body sone,
And bare it forth to Alcione,
His wif the queen, theras she lay,
Right even a quarter° before day,
And stood right at her beddis fete,
And called hir, right as she hete,°
By name, and said, “My swete wife,
Awak! let be° your sorwful life!
For in your sorwe ther lith no rede;°
For certes, swete, I am but dede;
Ye shul me never on live yse.°
But good sweet herte look that ye
Bury my body, for suche a tide°
Ye mowe it find the see beside;°
And farwel, sweet, my worldes blisse!
I praye God your sorwe lisse;°
To° litel while our blisse lasteth!”
 
¶With that hir eyen up she casteth,
And sawe noght.° Quod she, “For sorwe!”
And died within the thridde morwe.
But what she said more in that swow°
I may not telle yow as now,
It were to longe for to dwelle;
My first matere° I wil yow telle,
Wherfore° I have told this thinge
Of Alcione and Seys the kinge.
 
¶For thus much dar I saye welle,
I had be dolven° everydelle,°
And ded, right through defaulte° of slepe,
If I nad redde° and take kepe°
Of this tale next before:°
And I wol telle yow wherfore;
For I ne might,° for boot ne bale,°
Slepe, or° I had red this tale
Of this dreinte° Seys the kinge,
And of the goddis of slepinge.
Whan I had red this tale wel,
And overloked° it everydel,°
Me thoght° wonder if it were so;
For I had never herd speke, or tho,°
Of no goddis that coude make
Men for to sleep, ne for to wake;
For I ne knew never god but oon.
And in my game° I said anoon—
And yet me list right evel to pley—
“Rather then that I shulde dey°
Through defaulte° of sleping thus,
I wold yive° thilke Morpheus,
Or his goddesse, dame Juno,
Or som wight,° I ne roghte° who—
To make me slepe and have som reste—
I wil yive him the alderbeste°
Yift° that ever he abode° his live,
And here onward, right now, as blive;°
Yif he wol make me slepe a lite,
Of downe° of pure dowves° white
I wil yif° him a feder° bedde,
Rayed° with golde, and right wel cledde°
In fin blak satin doutremere,°
And many a pilow, and every bere°
Of clothe of Reines, to slepe softe;
Him thar not need° to turnen ofte.
And I wol yive him al that falles°
To a chambre;° and al his halles
I wol do peint° with pure golde,
And tapite° hem ful many folde°
Of one sute;° this shal he have,
If I wist° where were his cave,
If he can mak me slepe sone,
As did the goddesse Alcione.
And thus this ilke° god, Morpheus,
May winne of me mo fees° thus
Than ever he wanne; and to Juno,
That is his goddesse, I shal so° do,
I trow° that she shal holde her paide.”°
 
¶I hadde unneth° that worde ysaide
Right thus as I have tolde it yow,
That sodeinly, I niste° how,
Suche a lust° anoon me tooke°
To sleep, that right upon my booke
I fil aslepe, and therwith evene°
Me met° so inly° swete a swevene,°
So wonderful, that never yitte
I trowe° no man had the witte
To konne° wel my sweven rede;°
No, not Joseph, withoute drede,°
Of Egipte, he that redde° so
The kinges meting° Pharao,
No moor than coud the leste of us;
Ne nat scarsly Macrobeus,
(He that wrote al th’avisioun°
That he met, king Scipioun,
The noble man, the Affrican—
Suche mervailes fortuned than)°
I trowe, ared° my dremes even.°
Lo, thus it was, this was my sweven.°
Me thoghte thus: that it was May,
And in the dawning there I lay,
 
¶Me met thus, in my bed al naked:—
And loked forth, for I was waked
With smale foules° a gret hepe,°
That had affraied° me out of slepe
Through noise and swetnesse of her song;
And, as me met, they sate among,°
Upon my chambre roof withoute,
Upon the tiles, al aboute,
And songen, everich in his wise,
The moste solempne° servise
By note,° that ever man, I trowe,
Had herd; for somme of hem song lowe,
Som high, and al of oon acorde.
To telle shortly, at oo worde,
Was never herd so swete a steven,°
But it had be° a thing of heven;
So mery a soun, so swete entunes,°
That certes, for the toune of Tewnes,
I nold but I had° herde hem singe,
For al my chambre gan to ringe
Through singinge of hir armonie.
For instrument nor melodie
Was nowher herd yet half so swete,
Nor of acorde° half so mete;°
For ther was noon of hem that feined°
To sing, for ech of hem him peined
To finde out mery crafty notes;
They ne spared not hir throtes.
And, soth to seyn, my chambre was
Ful wel depeinted, and with glas
Were al the windowes wel yglased,°
Ful clere, and nat an hole ycrased,°
That to beholde it was gret joye.
For holy al the storie of Troye
Was in the glasinge ywroghte thus,
Of Ector and king Priamus,
Of Achilles and Lamedon,
Of Medea and of Jason,
Of Paris, Eleine, and Lavine.
And al the walles with colours fine
Were peinted, bothe text and glose,°
Of al the Romaunce of the Rose.
My windows weren shet echon,
And through the glas the sonne shon
Upon my bed with brighte bemes,
With many gladde° gilde° stremes;
And eek the welken° was so faire,
Blew, bright, clere was the aire,
And ful atempre,° for sothe, it was;
For nother cold nor hoot it was,
Ne in al the welken was a cloude.
 
 
¶And as I lay thus, wonder° loude
Me thoght I herde an hunte° blowe
T’assay° his horn, and for to knowe
Whether it were clere or hors° of soune.
I herde goinge, up and doune,
Men, horse, hounds, and other thinge;
And al men speken° of huntinge,
How they wold slee the hert° with strengthe,
And how the hert had, upon lengthe,
So moche embosed,° I not° now what.
 
¶Anon right, whan I herde that,
How that they wolde on hunting goon,
I was right glad, and up anoon;
I took my hors, and forthe I went
Out of my chambre; I never stent°
Til I com to the feld withoute.°
Ther overtoke° I a gret route°
Of hunts and eke of foresters,
With many relaies° and limers,°
And hied hem° to the forest faste,
And I with hem;—so at the laste
I asked oon° ladde a limere:
“Say felow, who shal hunten here
Quod I; and he answered agein,
 
¶“Sir, th’emperour Octovien,”
Quod he, “and is her faste by.”°
 
¶“A Gods halfe, in good time,” quod I
Go we faste!” and gan to ride.
Whan we cam to the forest side,
Every man did, right anoon,
As to huntinge fel to doon.°
The maister-hunte° anon, fot-hote,°
With a gret horne blew three mote°
At the uncouplinge of his houndes.
Withinne a whil the herte founde is,
Yhalowed,° and rechased° faste
Longe time; and at the laste,
This herte rused° and stal away
Fro al the hounds a prive° way.
The hounds had overshette° hem alle,
And were on a defaulte yfalle;°
Therwith the hunte wonder faste
Blewe a forleigne° at the laste.
 
¶I was go walked° fro my tre,
And as I went, ther cam by me
A whelp,° that fauned° me as I stoode,
That hadde yfolowed, and coud no goode.°
It came and crept to me as lowe,
Right as it hadde me yknowe,
Held doun his heed and joined his eres,
And leide al smothe° doun his heres.°
I wolde have caught it, and anoon
It fled, and was fro me agoon;
And I him folwed, and it forth went
Doun by a floury grene went°
Ful thikke of gras, ful softe and swete,
With floures fel,° faire under fete,
And litel used, it semed thus;
For bothe Flora and Zephirus,
They two that make floures growe,
Had mad hir dwelling ther, I trowe;°
For it was, on for to beholde,
As thogh the erthe envie° wolde
To be gayer than the heven,
To have mo floures, swiche seven°
As in the welken° sterres be.
It had forget the povertee
That winter, through his colde morwes,
Had mad it suffren, and his sorwes;
Al was forgete, and that was sene.
For al the wood was waxen° grene,
Swetnesse of dewe had made it waxe.°
 
¶It is no nede eek for to axe
Wher° ther were many grene greves,°
Or thikke trees, so ful of leves;
And every tree stood by himselve
Fro other wel ten feet or twelve.
So grete trees, so huge of strengthe,
Of fourty or fifty fadme° lengthe,
Clene withoute bough or stikke,°
With croppes° brode, and eke as thikke—
They were nat an inche asonder—
That it was shadwe° overal under;
And many an hert and many an hinde°
Was both befor me and behinde.
Of fawnes,° sowres,° bukkes,° does°
Was ful the wode, and many roes,°
And many squirelles, that sete
Ful high upon the trees, and ete,
And in hir maner made festes.
Shortly, it was so ful of bestes,
That thogh Argus, the noble counter,°
Set to rekene in his counter,°
And reken with his figures ten—
For by tho figures mowe al ken,°
If they be crafty,° rekene° and noumbre,
And tel of every thing the noumbre—
Yet shulde he fail to rekene evene
The wondres, me mette° in my swevene.
 
¶But forth they romed wonder faste
Doun° the wood; so at the laste
I was war of a man in blak,
That sat and had yturned his bak
To an oke,° an huge tree.
“Lord,” thought I, “who may that be?
What aileth him to sitten here?”
Anoonright I wente nere;
Than founde I sitte even upright
A wonder welfaringe° knight,—
By the maner me thoghte so—
Of good mochel,° and yong therto,
Of th’age of foure and twenty yere.
Upon his berd° but litel here,°
And he was clothed al in blake.
I stalked° even unto° his backe,
And there I stoode as stille as ought,°
That, soth to saye, he saw me nought,
Forwhy° he henge his hede adoune.
And with a dedly sorwful soune°
He made of rime ten vers or twelve,
Of a compleinte to himselve,
The most pitee, the moste routhe,°
That ever I herd; for, by my trouthe,
It was gret wonder that Nature
Might suffren any creature
To have such sorwe, and be not ded.
Ful pitous, pale, and nothing red,
He said a lay,° a maner songe,
Withoute note, withoute songe,
And it was this; for wel I can
Reherse° it; right thus it began.—
 
¶“I have of sorwe so gret wone,°
That joye gete I never none,
Now that I see my lady bright,
Which I have loved with al my might,
Is fro me ded, and is agoon.
[deliberately omitted] (see textual notes)
 
¶“Allas, O deth! what aileth° the
That thou noldest° have taken me,
    Whan that thou took my lady swete?
That was so fair, so fresh, so fre,°
So good, that men may wel yse °
    Of al goodness she had no mete!”°—
 
¶Whan he had mad thus his complaint,
His sorwful hert gan faste faint,
And his spirites wexen dede;°
The blood was fled, for pure drede,°
Doun to his hert, to make him warme—
For wel it feled° the hert had harme—
To wete eek° why it was adrad°
By kinde,° and for to make it glad;
For it is membre° principal
Of the body; and that made al
His hewe° chaunge and wexe grene
And pale, for ther no blood was sene
In no maner limme° of his.
 
¶Anoon therwith whan I saw this,
He ferd° thus evel° there° he sete,
I went and stood right at his fete,
And grette him, but he spake noght,
But argued with his owne thoght,
And in his wit disputed faste
Why and how his lif might laste;
Him thought his sorwes were so smerte°
And lay so colde upon his herte;
So, throgh his sorwe and hevy thoght,°
Made him that he herd me noght;
For he had wel nigh lost his minde,
Thogh Pan, that men clep° god of kinde,°
Were for his sorwes never so wrothe.°
 
¶But at the last, to sayn right sothe,
He was war° of me, how I stoode
Before him, and did of° min hoode,
And grette him, as I best coude.
Debonairly,° and nothing loude,
He saide, “I prey thee, be not wrothe,
I herd thee not, to seyn the sothe,
Ne I saw the not, sir, trewly.”
 
¶“A! goode sir, no fors,”° quod I,
I am right sory if I have ought°
Destroubled yow out of your thoughte;
Forgif me if I have mistake.”°
 
¶“Yis, th’amendes is light° to make,”
Quod he, “for ther lith noon therto;
There is nothing missaid nor do.”
 
¶Lo! how goodly spak this knighte,
As it had ben another wighte;°
He made it nouther tough ne queinte°
And I saw that, and gan me aqueinte°
With him, and found him so tretable,°
Right wonder skilful° and resonable,
As me thoght,° for al his bale.°
Anoonright I gan finde a tale°
To him, to loke wher I might oughte°
Have more knowinge of his thoughte.
“Sir,” quod I, “this game° is doon;
I holde° that this hert be goon;
These huntes° can him nowher see.”
 
¶“I do no fors therof,”° quod he,
My thought is theron never a dele.”°
 
¶“By our Lord, I trow° yow wele,
Right so me thinketh by your chere.
But, sir, oo° thinge wol ye here?°
Me thinketh, in great sorwe I you see;
But certes, sire, if that ye
Wolde ought discure° me your woo,
I wolde, as wis° God help me soo,
Amende it, if I can or may;
Ye mowe° prove it by assay.°
For, by my trouth,° to mak you hool,°
I wol do al my power hool;
And telleth me of your sorwes smerte,
Paraunter° it may ease your herte,
That semeth ful seke° under your side.”
 
¶With that he loked on me aside,
As who saith, “Nay, that wol not be.”
“Graunt mercy, goode frend,” quod he,
“I thank the that thou woldest soo,
But it may never the rather° be doo.
No man may my sorwe glade,
That maketh my hew° to fal and fade,
And hath min understonding lorne,°
That me is wo that I was borne!
May nothing° mak my sorwes slide,°
Nought the remedies of Ovide;
Ne Orpheus, god of melodie,
Ne Dedalus, with playes° slie;°
Ne° heel me may no phisicien,
Noght Ypocras, ne Galien;
Me is wo that I live oures twelve;
But who so wol assay° himselve
Whether his hert can have pite
Of any sorwe, lat him see me.
I wrech, that deth hath made al naked
Of al the bliss that ever was maked,
Yworthe° worste of alle wightes,°
That hate my dayes and my nightes;
My lif, my lustes° be me loothe,
For al welfare and I be wroothe.°
The pure deth is so my foo,
That I wold deye, it wold not so;
For whan I folwe it, it wol flee;
I wolde have it, it nil° not me.
This is my pein withoute rede,°
Alway deyinge, and be not dede,
That Sesiphus, that lith in helle
May not of more sorwe telle.
And whoso wiste° al, by my trouthe,
My sorwe, but he° hadde routhe
And pite of my sorwes smerte,
That man hath a feendly° herte.
For who so seeth me firste on morwe
May seyn, he hath ymet with sorwe;
For I am sorwe and sorwe is I.
 
¶“Allas! and I wol tel the why;
My sorwe is turned to pleyninge,°
And al my laughter to wepinge,
My gladde thoughts to hevinesse,
In travaile° is min idelnesse
And eek my rest; my wele is wo.
My goode is harme, and ever mo
In wrathe is turned my pleyinge,
And my delite into sorwinge.
Min hele° is turned into seeknesse,
In drede° is al my sikernesse.°
To derke is turned al my lighte,
My witte is foly, my day is nighte,
My love is hate, my sleep wakinge,
My mirthe and meles° is fastinge,
My countenaunce° is nicete,°
And al abaved° wherso I be,
My pees, in pledinge° and in werre;
Allas! how might I fare werre?°
My boldenesse is turned to shame,
For fals Fortune hath pleide a game
“At ches with me, allas! the while!°
The traiteress fals and ful of gile,
That al behoteth° and nothing halte,°
She goth° upright and yet she halte,°
That baggeth° foule and loketh faire,
The dispitouse debonaire,°
That scorneth many a creature!
An idole° of fals portraiture
Is she, for she wol sone wryen;°
She is the monstres hed ywryen,°
As filthe over ystrawed° with floures;
Hir moste worship° and hir flour° is
To lyen,° for that is hir nature;
Withoute feithe, lawe, or mesure°
She is fals; and ever laughinge
With one eye, and that other wepinge.
That° is broght up, she sette al doun.
I likne hir to the scourpioun,
That is a false flatering beste;
For with his hede he maketh feste,°
But al amidde his flateringe
With his taile he wol stinge,
And envenime;° and so wol she.
She is th’envious° charite
That is ay fals, and semeth wele,
So turneth she hir false whele
About, for it is nothing stable,
Now by the fire, now at the table;
For many hath she thus yblent.°
She is pley of enchauntement,
That semeth oon and is nat so,
The false theef! what hath she do,
Trowest thou?° by our Lorde, I wol thee sey.”°
At ches with me she gan to pley;
With hir false draughtes° divers
She staale on° me, and took my fers.°
And whan I saw my fers away,
Allas! I couth no lenger play,
But seide, ‘Farwel, swete, ywis,°
And farwel al that ever ther is!’
 
¶“Therwith Fortune said ‘Chek here!’°
And ‘Mate!’° in mid point of the chekkere°
With a poune errante,° allas!
Ful craftier to pley she was
Than Athalus, that mad the game
First of the ches: so was his name.
But God wolde° I had ones or twies
Ykoude and know° the jeupardies°
That coud the Greek Pithagores,
I shulde have pleyd the bet° at ches,
And kept my fers the bet therby;
And though wherto?° for trewely
I hold that wish nat worthe a stre!°
It had be never° the bet for me.
For Fortune can° so many a wile,°
Ther be but few can hir begile,
And eek° she is the las to blame;
Myselfe I wolde have do the same,
Befor God, had I ben as she;
She ought the more excused be.
For this I say yet moor therto,
Had I be God and mighte have do
My wille, whan my fers she caught,
I wolde have draw the same draught.°
For, also wis° God yif me reste,
I dar wel swer she took the beste!
 
¶“But through that draughte I have lorne°
My blisse; allas! that I was borne!
For evermore, I trowe° trewly,
For al my will, my luste° holly
Is turned; but yet, what to doone?
By our Lorde, it is to die soone;
For nothinge I ne leve° it noght,
But live and dey° right in this thoght.
Ther nis planete in firmament,
Ne in air, ne in erth, non element,
That they ne yive° me a yifte echon
Of weping, whan I am allon.
For whan that I avis me° wel,
And bethenke me every del,°
How that ther lith in rekeninge,°
In my sorwe, for nothinge;°
And how ther leveth° no gladnesse
May gladde me of my distresse,
And how I have lost suffisance,°
And therto I have no plesance,
Than may I say, I have right noght.°
 
¶“And whan this falleth in my thoght,
Allas! than am I overcome!
For that is doon is not to come!°
I have moor sorwe than Tantale.”
And whan I herd him tel this tale
Thus pitously, as I you telle,
Unnethe° might I lenger dwelle,°
It did min herte so much wo.
 
¶“A! good sir!” quod I, “Say not so!
Have som pite on your nature
That formed you° creature,
Remembre you of Socrates;
For he ne counted nat three strees°
Of noght° that Fortune coude do.”
 
¶“No,” quod he, “I can not so.”
 
¶“Why so? good sir! parde!” quod I;
“Ne say noght so, for trewely,
Thogh ye had lost the ferses° twelve,
And° ye for sorwe mordred° yourselve,
Ye shold be dampned in this cas
By as good° right as Medea was
That° slough hir children for Jason;
And Phyllis als for Demophon
Henge hirself, so weylaway!
For he had broke his terme-day°
To com to hir. Another rage

That slough hirself, for° Eneas
Was false whiche° a fool she was!
And Ecquo died for Narcisus
Nold nat love hir; and righte thus
Hath many another foly don.
And for Dalida died Sampson,
That slough° himself with a pilere.°
But ther is noon alive here
Wolde for a fers° make this woo!”
 
¶“Why so?” quod he; “It is nat soo;
Thou wost ful litel what thou menest;°
I have lost more than thou wenest.”°
 
¶“Lo, sir, how may that be?” quod I;
“Good sir, tel me al holely
In what wise, how, why, and wherfore
That ye have thus your blisse lore.”°
 
¶“Blithly,”° quod he, “com sitte adoun;
I tell thee up a condicioun
That thou shalt hooly, with al thy wit,
Do thin entent° to herkene° it.”
 
¶“Yis, sir.” “Swere thy trouth therto.”
 
¶“Gladly.” “Do than hold herto!”
 
¶“I shal right blithly, God me save,
Hooly, with al the witte I have,
Here° you, as wel as I can.”°
 
¶“A° Goddes half!” quod he, and began:—
“Sir,” quod he, “sith firste I couthe°

To love hooly with goode entente,
And throgh plesaunce become his thralle,
With good will, body, hert, and alle.
Al this I putte in his° servage,
As to my lorde, and did homage;
And ful devoutly praid him to,
He shuld beset° min herte so,
That it plesaunce to him were,
And worship° to my lady dere.
 
¶“And this was longe, and many a yere
Or that° min hert was set owhere,°
That I did thus, and niste° why;
I trowe° it cam me kindely.°
Paraunter° I was therto moste able
As a white walle or a table;
For it is redy to cacche and take
Al that men wil therin make,
Wherso° men wil portrey or peint,
Be the werkes never so queint.°
 
¶“And thilke time° I ferd right so°
I was able to have lerned tho,
And to have kende° as wel or better,
Paraunter, other arte or° letter
But for° love cam firste in my thought
Therfore I forgate it noght.
I ches love to my firste craft,°
Therfor it is with me ylaft.°
Forwhy° I toke it of so yonge age,
That malice° hadde my corage°
Nat° that time turned to nothinge
Through to° mochel knowlachinge.
For that time youthe, my maistresse,

For it was in my firste youthe,

For al my werkes were flittinge,°
That time and al my thoght varyinge;
Al° were to me yliche° goode,
That I knew tho;° but thus it stoode.
 
¶“It happed that I cam on a day
Into a place, ther that I say,°
Trewly, the fairest companye

Shal I clepe° it happe° other° grace

That is to lyen ful comune,°
The false traiteress, pervers,
God wolde° I coude clepe° hir wers!
For now she worcheth me ful wo,
And I wol telle soon why so.
 
¶“Among these ladies thus echon,
Soth to seyn, I saugh ther oon
That was lik noon of al the route;°
For I dar swer, withoute doute,
That as the sommers sonne brighte
Is fairer, clerer, and hath mor lighte
Than any other planete in hevene,
The moone, or the sterres sevene,
For al the worlde, so had she
Surmountede hem al of beaute,
Of maner and of comlinesse,
Of stature and wel set gladnesse,
Of goodlihed so wel besey°—
Shortly, what shal I more sey?
By God, and by his halwes° twelve,
It was my sweet, right as hirselve!
She had so stedfast countenaunce,
So noble porte and meintenaunce.°
And Love, that had wel herd my boone,°
Had espyed me thus soone,
That she ful sone, in my thoght
As help me God, so was ycaught
So sodenly, that I ne toke
No maner reed° but at hir loke
And at min hert; forwhy° hir eyen
So gladly, I trow,° min herte seyen,°
That purely tho° min owne thoght
Seide it were bet° serve hir for noght°
Than with another to be wel.
And it was soth,° for, everydel,
I wil anonright tel thee why.
 
¶“I saugh hir daunce so comlily,°
Carole° and sing so swetely,
Laughe and pley so womanly,
And loke so debonairly,°
So goodly speke and so frendly,
That certes, I trow, that evermore
Nas seyn° so blisful a tresore.
For every heer° upon hir hede,
Soth to seyne, it was not rede,
Ne nouther yelwe, ne broune it nas;
Me thoghte, most lik gold it was.
 
¶And which eyen my lady hadde!
Debonair, goode, glade, and sadde,°
Simple, of good mochel,° noght to wide;
Therto hir look nas° not aside,
Ne overthwert,° but beset so wele,
It drew and toke up, everydele,°
Al that on hir gan beholde.
Hir eyen semed anon she wolde
Have mercy; fooles wenden so;
But it was never the rather do.°
It nas no countrefeted° thinge,
It was hir owne pure lokinge,
That the goddess, dame Nature,
Had made hem open by mesure,
And clos; for, were she never so glad,
Hir loking° was not foly sprad,°
Ne wildely, thogh that° she pleide;
But ever, me thoght, hir eyen seide,
‘By God, my wrathe is al foryive!’°
 
¶“Therwith hir list° so wel to live,
That dulness was of hir adrad.°
She nas to sobre° ne to glad;
In alle thinges moor mesure
Had never, I trowe, creature.
But many with hir look she hert,°
And that sat hir ful lite° at hert,
For she knew nothinge of hir° thoght;
But whether she knew, or knew it nought
Algate° she ne rought° of hem a stree!°
To gete hir love no ner° nas he
That woned° at hom, than he in Inde;
The formest° was alway behinde.
But goode folk, over al other,
She loved as man may do his brother;
Of which love she was wonder large,°
In skilful places° that bere charge.°
 
¶“Which a visage had she therto!
Allas! min hert is wonder wo
That I ne can discriven° it!
Me lakketh both English and wit
For to undo it at the fulle;
And eek° my spirits be so dulle
So grete a thing for to devise.°
I have no wit that can suffise
To comprehenden hir beaute;
But thus much dar I seyn, that she
Was rody, fresh, and lively hewed;
And every day hir beaute newed.°
And negh° hir face was alderbest;°
For certes, Nature had swich lest°
To mak that fair, that trewly she
Was hir chief patrone° of beaute,
And chief ensample of al hir werke,
And moustre;° for, be it never so derke,
Me thinketh I see hir evermo.
And yet moreover, thogh° al tho
That ever lived were now alive,
Ne sholde have founde to discrive°
In al hir face a wikked signe;
For it was sad,° simple, and benigne.
 
¶“And which° a goodly softe speche
Had that sweet, my lives leche!°
So frendly, and so wel ygrounded,°
Upon al resoun wel yfounded,
And so tretable° to al goode,
That I dar swere by the roode,°
Of eloquence was never founde
So swete a sowninge facounde,°
Ne trewer tonged, ne scorned° lasse,
Ne bet coud heel that, by the masse
I durst° swere, thogh the pope it songe,
That ther was never throgh hir tonge;
Man ne woman gretly harmed;
As for hir° was al harme hid;
Ne lasse flateringe in hir worde,
That purely, hir simple recorde
Was founde as trewe as any bonde,°
Or trouthe of° any mannes honde.
Ne chide she coude never a dele,°
That knoweth al the world ful wele.
 
¶“But swiche a fairnesse of a nekke
Had that sweet, that boon nor brekke°
Nas ther non° sene, that missatte.°
It was whit, smooth, streght, and pure flatte,
Withouten hole° or canel-boon,°
As by seminge, had she noon.
Hir throte, as I have now memoire,
Semed a rounde toure of ivoire,°
Of good gretnesse,° and noght to grete.
 
¶“And goode faire White she hete,°
That was my lady name righte.
She was bothe faire and brighte,°
She hadde not hir name wronge.
Right faire shuldres, and body longe°
She had, and armes, every lith°
Fattish,° flesshy, not great therwith;
Right white handes, and nailes rede,
Rounde brestes; and of good brede°
Hir hippes were, a streight flat bakke.
I knewe on hir noon other lakke°
That al hir limmes nere sewinge,°
In as ferre as I had knowinge.
 
¶“Therto she coude so wel pley,
Whan that hir list, that I dar sey,
That she was lik to torche bright,
That every man may take of light
Ynogh, and it hath never the lesse.
Of maner and of comlinesse°
Right so ferd° my lady dere;
For every wight° of hir manere
Might cacche° ynogh, if that he wolde,
If he had eyen hir to beholde.
For I dar sweren, if that she
Had among ten thousand be,
She wolde have be, at the lest,
A cheef mirour° of al the fest,
Thogh they had stonden in a rowe,
To mennes eyen that coude knowe.
For wherso men had pleid or waked,
Me thoght the feliwshippe as naked°
Withouten hir, that saw I ones,
As a crown withoute stones.°
Trewly she was, to min eye,
The solein° fenix° of Arabye,
For ther liveth never but oon;°
Ne swich as she ne knowe I noon.
 
¶“To speke of goodness; trewly she
Had as much debonairte°
As ever had Hester in the Bible,
And more, if more were possible.
And, soth to seyne, therwithalle
She had a wit so generalle,°
So hoole enclined to alle goode,
That al hir wit was set, by the roode,°
Withoute malice, upon gladnesse;
Therto I saw never yet a lesse
Harmful, than she was in doinge.
I sey nat that she nad° knowinge
What harme was; or elles° she
Had coud no good,° so thinketh me.°
¶“And trewly, for to speke of trouthe,°
But she had hadde,° it had be routhe.°
Therof she had so moche hir dele°—
And I dar seyn and swere it wele—
That Trouthe himselfe, over al and al,
Had chose his maner° principal
In hir, that was his resting place.
Therto she had the moste grace,
To have stedfast perseveraunce,
And esy, attempre° governaunce,
That ever I knewe or wiste yitte;
So pure suffraunt° was hir witte.
And reson gladly she understoode,
It folwed wel she coude goode.°
She used gladly to do wel;
Thes were hir maners everydel.°
 
¶“Therwith she loved so wel right,
She wrong do wolde to no wight;°
No wight ne mighte do hir shame,
She loved so wel hir owne name.°
Hir lust° to hold no wight in honde;°
Ne, be thou siker,° she nolde° fonde°
To holde no wight in balaunce,°
By half word ne by countenaunce,
But if° men wolde upon hir lie;
Ne send men into Walakie,°
To Pruise° and into Tartarie,°
To Alisaundre,° ne into Turkie,
And bid him faste° anoon that he
Go hoodles° to the drye see,°
And com hom by the Carrenare;°
And seye, “Sir, be now right ware°
That I may of yow here seyn
Worshippe, or that° ye come agein!”
She ne used no such knakkes° smale.
 
¶“But wherfor that I tel my tale?
Right on this same, as I have seide,
Was hooly al my love leid;
For certes, she was, that swete wife,
My suffisaunce, my lust,° my life,
Min hap,° min hele,° and al my blisse,
My worlds welfare and my goddesse
And I hirs hooly, everydel.”°
 
¶“By our lord, I trow° yow wel!
Hardly,° your love was wel besette,
I not° how ye might have do bette.”°
“Bet? ne noght so wel!” quod he.
“I trowe it, sir,” quod I, “parde!”
“Nay, leve it wel!” “Sir, so do I;
I leve° yow wel, that trewely
Yow thoghte, that she was the beste,
And to behold the alderfaireste,°
Who so had loked with your eyen.”
 
¶“With min? nay, alle that hir seyen°
Seide, and swore it was so.
And thogh they nadde,° I wolde tho°
Have loved best my lady free,°
Thogh I had hadde al the beautee
That ever had Alcipiades,°
And al the strengthe of Ercules,°
And therto had the worthinesse
Of Alisaundre, and al the richesse
That ever was in Babiloine,
In Cartage, or in Macedoine,
Or in Rome, or in Ninive;°
And therto also hardy° be
As was Ector, so have I joye,
That Achilles slough° at Troye—
And therfor was he slain also
In a temple, for bothe two
Were slaine, he and Antilegius,
And so seith Dares Frigius,
For love of hir, Polixena—
Or ben as wis° as Minerva,
I wolde ever, withoute drede,°
Have loved hir, for I most nede!°
‘Nede!’ nay, I gabbe° nowe,
Noght ‘nede,’ and I wol telle howe,
For of good will° min hert it wolde,
And eek to love hir I was holde°
As for the fairest and the beste.
She was as good, so have I reste,
As ever was Penelope of Grece,
Or as the noble wif Lucrece,
That was the best—he telleth thus,
The Romain Titus Livius—
She was as good, and nothing like,
Thogh hir stories be autentike;°
Algate° she was as trewe as she.
 
¶“But wherfor° that I telle thee
Whan I first my lady say?°
I was right yonge, soth to say,
And ful gret nede I had to lerne;
Whan my herte wolde yerne°
To love, it was a grete emprise.°
But as my wit coud best suffise,°
After my yonge childly wit,
Withoute drede, I besette it
To love hir in my beste wise,
To do hir worship° and servise
That I tho coude° by my trouthe,
Withoute feining outher slouthe;°
For wonder feine° I wolde° hir se.
So mochel it amended me,°
That, whan I saw hir first amorwe,°
I was warished° of al my sorwe
Of al day after, til it were eve;
Me thoghte nothing might me greve,
Were my sorwes never so smerte.°
And yet she sit so in min herte,
That, by my trouthe, I nolde noght,°
For al this worlde, oute of my thoght
Leve my lady; no, trewly!”
 
¶“Now, by my trouthe, sir,” quod I,
“Me thinketh ye have suche a chaunce
As shrift° withoute repentaunce.”
 
¶“Repentaunce! nay fy,” quod he;
“Shulde I now repente me
To love? nay, certes, than were I wel
Wers than was Achitofel,°
Or Anthenor,° so have I joye,
The traitor that betraised° Troye,
Or the false Genellon,°
He that purchased° the treson
Of Rowlande and of Olivere.
Nay, while I am alive here
I nil° foryete hir nevermo.”
 
¶“Now, goode sir,” quod I right tho,°
“Ye han wel told me herbefore.
It is no need reherse it more°
How ye sawe hir firste, and where;
But wold ye tel me the manere,
To hir which was your firste speche—
Therof I wolde yow beseche—
And how she knewe first your thoght,
Whether ye loved hir or noght,
And telleth me eek what ye have lore;°
I herd you telle herbefore.”
 
¶“Ye,” seid he, “thou nost° what thou menest;
I have lost more than thou wenest.”°
 
¶“What losse is that, sir?” quod I tho;°
“Nil she not love yow? is it so?
Or have ye oght ydon amis,
That she hath left yow? is it this?
For Goddes love, tel me alle.”
 
¶“Befor God,” quod he, “and I shalle.
I saye right as I have seide,
On hir was al my love leide;
And yet she niste° it never a del
Noght longe time, leve° hit wel.
For be right siker, I durste° noght
For al this world tel hir my thoght,
Ne I wolde have wrathed° hir, trewly.
For wostow why? she was lady
Of the body; she had the° hert,
And who hath that, may not astert.°
 
¶To kepe me fro idelnesse,
Trewly I did my besinesse
To make songs, as I best coude,°
And ofte time I songe hem loude;
And made° songs a grete dele,
Althogh I coud not mak so wele
Songs, ne know the arte alle,
As coude Lameks° son Tuballe,°
That founde out first the art of songe;
For, as his brothers hamers ronge
Upon his anvelt° up and doun,
Therof he took the firste soun;
But Grekes seyn, Pictagoras,°
That he the firste finder° was
Of the arte; Aurora telleth so,
But therof no fors,° of hem two.
Algates° songes thus I made
Of my feling, min hert to glade;
And lo! this was the altherfirst,°
I not° wher° that it were the werst.—
 
¶“Lorde, it maketh min herte light,
Whan I thenke on that swete wight°
That is so seemly° on to see;
And wissh to God it might so be,
That she wold hold me for° hir knight,
My lady, that is so faire and bright!”—
 
¶“Now have I told thee, soth to say,
My firste songe. Upon a day
I bethoghte me what wo
And sorwe that I suffred tho
For hir, and yet she wist° it noght,
Ne tel hir durst I nat my thoght.
“Allas!” thoght I, “I can no rede;°
And, but I° telle hir, I am but dede°
And if I telle hir, to sey right sothe,
I am adred she wol be wrothe;
Allas! what shal I thanne do?”
 
¶“In this debate I was so wo,°
Me thoght min herte brast atweine!°
So at the laste, soth to seyne,
I me bethoghte that nature
Ne formed never in creature
So moche beaute, trewely,
And bounte,° without mercy.
 
¶“In hope of that, my tale I tolde
With sorwe, as that I never sholde,
For nedes;° and, maugree° min hede,°
I most have tolde hir or be dede.
I not° wel how that I began,
Ful evel° reherse° it I can;
And eke, as help me God withalle,
I trowe° it was in the dismalle,°
That was the ten wounds° of Egipte;
For many a worde I overskipte
In my tale, for pure fere
Lest my wordes misset° were.
With sorweful herte, and woundes dede,°
Softe° and quaking for pure drede
And shame, and stintinge° in my tale
For ferde, and min hewe al pale,
Ful ofte I wex both pale and rede;°
Bowing to hir, I heng the heed;
I durste° nat ones loke hir on,
For wit, manere, and al was gon.
I seide ‘Mercy!’ and no more;
It nas no game, it sat me sore.
 
¶“So at the laste, soth to seyne,
Whan that min hert was come ageine,
To telle shortly al my speche,
With hool herte I gan hir beseche
That she wold be my lady swete;
And swore, and gan hir hertly hete°
Ever to be stedfast and trewe,
And love hir alwey freshly newe,
And never other lady have,
And al hir worship° for to save
As I best coude;° I swore hir this—
‘For yours is al that ever ther is
For evermore, min herte swete!
And never fals yow, but I mete,°
I nil,° as wis° God help me so!’
 
¶“And whan I had my tale ydo,
God wot,° she acounted nat a stre°
Of al my tale, so thoghte me.
To telle shortly as it is,
Trewly hir answere, it was this;
I can not now wel counterfete°
Hir wordes, but this was the grete°
Of hir answere; she said, ‘Nay’
Alle outerly.° Allas! that day
The sorwe I suffred, and the wo!
That trewly Cassandra, that so
Bewailed° the destruccioun
Of Troye and of Ilion,
Had never swich sorwe as I tho.
I durste° no more say therto
For pure fear, but stale away;
And thus I lived ful many a day.
That trewely, I had no nede
Ferther than my beddes hede°
Never a day to seche° sorwe;
I fonde it redy every morwe,
Forwhy I loved hir in no gere.°
 
¶“So it befel, another yere,
I thoughte ones I wolde fonde°
To do hir knowe° and understonde
My wo; and she wel understode
That I ne wilned thing but gode,
And worshippe, and to kepe hir name
Over al thing, and dred hir shame,
And was so besy hir to serve;—
And pitee were I shulde sterve,°
Sith° that I wilned noon harme, ywis.
So whan my lady knewe al this,
My lady yaf me al hooly
The noble yifte of hir mercy,
Savinge hir worship,° by al weyes;
Dredles, I mene noon other weyes.
And therwith she yaf° me a ringe;
I trowe it was the firste thinge;
But yif min herte was ywaxe°
Glad, that is no need to axe!°
As help me God, I was as blive,°
Reised, as fro dethe to live,
Of alle haps° the alderbeste,
The gladdest and the moste at reste.°
For trewely, that swete wight,°
Whan I had wrong and she the right,
She wolde alwey so goodely
Foryeve me so debonairly.°
In al my youthe, in alle chaunce,°
She took me in hir governaunce.
 
¶“Therwith she was alway so trewe,°
Our joy was ever yliche newe;°
Our hertes wern so evene° a paire,
That never nas that oon contraire
To that other, for no wo.
For sothe, ylich° they suffred tho
Oo blisse and eke oo sorwe bothe;
Ylich they were both glad and wrothe;°
Al was us oon, withoute were.°
And thus we lived ful many a yere
So wel, I can nat telle how.”
 
¶“Sir,” quod I, “where is she now?”
“Now”? quod he, and stinte anoon.°
 
¶Therwith he waxe° as dede as stoon,
And seide, “Allas! that I was bore!°
That was the los, that herbifore
I tolde thee, that I had lorne.°
Bethenk how I seid herbeforne,
‘Thou wost ful litel what thou menest;
I have lost more than thou wenest’—
God wote, allas! right that was she!”
 
¶“Allas! sir, how? what may that be?”
 
¶“She is ded!” “Nay!” “Yis, by my trouthe!”
 
¶“Is that your los? by God, it is routhe!”
And with that worde, right anon,
They gan to strake forth;° al was don,
For that time, the herte-huntinge.°
 
¶With that, me thoghte, that this kinge
Gan quikly hoomward for to ride
Unto a place was ther beside,
Which was from us but a lite,°
A long castel with walles white,
By Seint Johan! on a riche hille,
As me met;° but thus it fille.
Right thus me mette, as I you telle,
That in the castel was a belle,
As° it had smitten° houres twelve.—
 
¶Therewith I awook myselve,
And fond me lyinge in my bedde;
And the book that I had redde,
Of Alcione and Seys the kinge,
And of the goddes of slepinge
I fond it in min hond ful evene.°
Thoght I, “This is so queint° a swevene,
That I wol, by processe of time,
Fond° to put this swevene in rime°
As I can best”; and that anon.—
This was my sweven;° now it is don.
