A prentis° whilom° dwelled in our citee,
And of a craft° of vitaillers° was he;
Gaillard° he was as goldfinch in the shawe,°
Broun as a berie,° a propre° short felawe,°
With lokkes blake, ykembd ful fetisly.°
Dauncen he coud so wel and jolily,
That he was cleped° Perkin Revelour.°
He was as ful of love and paramour°
As is the hive ful of hony swete;
Wel was the wenche with him mighte mete.
At every bridale wolde he singe and hoppe,°
He loved bet° the tavern than the shoppe.
For whan ther any riding° was in Chepe,°
Out of the shoppe thider wolde he lepe.
Til that he hadde al the sighte yseyn,
And daunced wel, he wold nat come agein.
And gadered him a meinee° of his sort
To hoppe and singe, and maken swich disport.°
And ther they setten steven for to mete°
To pleyen at the dis° in swich a° strete.
For in the toune nas ther no prentis,
That fairer° coude caste a paire of dis
Than Perkin coude, and therto he was free°
Of his dispense,° in place of privetee.°
That fond his maister wel in his chaffare;°
For often time he fond his box° ful bare.
For sikerly a prentis revelour,
That haunteth° dis, riot,° or paramour,
His maister shal it in his shoppe abie,°
Al have° he no part of the minstralcie;
For thefte and riot, they ben convertible,°
Al conne° he pleye on giterne or ribible.°
Revel and trouthe,° as in a low degree,°
They been ful wrothe° al day, as men may see.

¶This joly prentis with his maister bood,°
Til he were ny° out of his prentishood,°
Al were° he snibbed° bothe erly and late,
And somtime lad with revel to Newgate;
But atte laste his maister him bithoghte,
Upon a day, whan he his papir° soghte,
Of a proverb that seith this same word,
“Wel bet° is roten appul out of hord°
Than that it rotie° al the remenaunt.”
So fareth it by a riotous servaunt;
It is ful lasse harm to lete him pace,°
Than he shende° al the servants in the place.
Therfore his maister yaf him acquitance,°
And bad him go with sorwe and with meschance;°
And thus this joly prentis hadde his leve.°
Now lat him riote al the night or leve.°
And for ther is no theef withoute a louke,°
That helpeth him to wasten and to souke°
Of that he bribe° can or borwe° may,
Anon he sente his bed and his array°
Unto a compeer° of his owne sort,
That loved dis and revel and disport,
And hadde a wif that heeld° for contenance°
A shoppe, and swived° for hir sustenance.°
