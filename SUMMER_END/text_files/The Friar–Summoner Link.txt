¶This Somnour in his stiropes° hye stood;
Upon this Frere his herte was so wood,°
That lik an aspen leef he quook° for ire.°
“Lordings,” quod he, “but o° thing I desire;
I yow biseek° that, of your curteisie,
Sin ye han herd this false Frere lie,
As suffereth me° I may my tale telle!
This Frere bosteth that he knoweth helle,
And God it woot,° that it is litel wonder;
Freres and feendes° been but lite asonder.°
For pardee,° ye han ofte time herd telle,
How that a frere ravisshed° was to helle
In spirit ones by a visioun;
And as an angel ladde° him up and doun,°
To shewen him the peines that ther were,
In al the place saugh he nat a frere;
Of other folk he saugh° ynowe° in wo.°
Unto this angel spak the frere tho:

¶“ ‘Now, sir,’ quod he, ‘han freres swich a grace°
That noon of hem shal come to this place?’

¶“ ‘Yis,’ quod this angel, ‘many a millioun!’
And unto Sathanas° he ladde him doun.
‘And now hath Sathanas,’ seith he, ‘a tail
Brodder° than of a carrik° is the sail.
Hold up thy tail, thou Sathanas!’ quod he,
‘Shew forth thin ers,° and lat the frere see
Where is the nest of freres in this place!’
And, er° that half a furlongwey of space,°
Right so as bees out swarmen from an hive,
Out of the devels ers ther gonne drive°
Twenty thousand freres in a route,°
And thurghout helle swarmeden aboute;
And comen again,° as faste as they may gon,
And in his ers they crepten everichon.°
He clapte° his tail again, and lay ful stille.
This frere, whan he looked hadde his fille
Upon the tormentz of this sory° place,
His spirit God restored of his grace°
Unto his body again, and he awook;
But natheles, for fere° yet he quook,
So was the devels ers ay in his minde,
That is his heritage of verray kinde.°
God save yow alle, save° this cursed Frere;
My prologe wol I ende in this manere.”
