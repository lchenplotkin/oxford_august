¶The Cook of London, whil the Reve spak,
For joye, him thoughte, he clawed° him on the bak,
“Ha! ha!” quod he, “For Cristes passioun,
This millere hadde a sharp conclusioun°
Upon his argument of° herbergage!°
Wel seide Salomon in his langage,
‘Ne bring nat every man into thin hous’;
For herberwing by nighte is perilous.
Wel oghte a man avised for to be°
Whom that he broghte into his privetee.°
I pray to God, so yeve° me sorwe and care,
If ever, sith° I highte° Hogge of Ware,
Herde I a miller bettre yset° awerk.
He hadde a jape of malice° in the derk.
But God forbede° that we stinten° here;
And therfore, if ye vouchesauf° to here
A tale of me, that am a povre man,
I wol yow telle as wel as ever I can
A litel jape° that fil° in our citee.”

¶Our Host answerde, and seide, “I graunte it thee;
Now telle on, Roger, look that it be good;
For many a pastee° hastow laten blood,°
And many a Jakke of Dovere° hastow sold
That hath been twyes hoot and twyes cold.
Of many a pilgrim hastow Cristes curs,
For° of thy persly° yet they fare the wors,
That they han eten with thy stubbel-goos;°
For in thy shoppe is many a flye loos.
Now telle on, gentil Roger, by thy name.
But yet I pray thee, be nat wrooth° for game,
A man may sey ful sooth° in game and pley.”

¶“Thou seist ful sooth,” quod Roger, “by my fey,°
But ‘sooth pley, quaad pley,’° as the Fleming seith;
And therfor, Herry Bailly, by thy feith,
Be thou nat wrooth, er we departen heer,
Though that my tale be of an hostileer.
But nathelees I wol nat telle it yit,
But er we parte, ywis, thou shalt be quit.”°
And therwithal he lough° and made chere,
And seide his tale, as ye shul after here.
