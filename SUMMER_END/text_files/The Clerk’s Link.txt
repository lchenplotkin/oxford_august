¶“Sir Clerk of Oxenford,” our Hoste saide,
“Ye ride as coy° and stille° as dooth a maide,°
Were° newe spoused,° sitting at the bord;°
This day ne herde I of your tonge a word.
I trowe° ye studie aboute som sophime,°
But Salomon seith, ‘Every thing hath time.’
For Goddes sake, as beth of bettre chere,
It is no time for to studien here.
Telle us som mery tale, by your fey;
For what man that is entred in a pley,°
He nedes moot° unto the pley assente.
But precheth nat, as freres doon in Lente,
To make us for our olde sinnes wepe,
Ne that thy tale make us nat to slepe.
Telle us som mery thing of aventures;—
Your termes,° your colours, and your figures,°
Kepe hem in stoor° til so be ye endite
Heigh style, as whan that men to kinges write.
Speketh so plein at this time, we yow preye,
That we may understonde what ye seye.”

¶This worthy Clerk benignely° answerde,
“Hoste,” quod he, “I am under your yerde;°
Ye han of us as now the governaunce,
And therfor wol I do yow obeisaunce,°
As fer as reson axeth,° hardily.
I wol yow telle a tale which that I
Lerned at Padowe° of a worthy clerk,
As preved by his wordes and his werk.
He is now deed and nailed in his cheste,°
I prey to God so yeve his soule reste!
Fraunceis Petrark, the laureat° poete,
Highte this clerk,° whos rethorike sweete
Enlumined al Itaille of° poetrie,
As Linian° dide of philosophie
Or lawe, or other art particuler;
But deeth, that wol nat suffre us dwellen heer
But as it were a twinkling of an eye,
Hem bothe hath slain, and alle shul we die.
But forth to tellen of this worthy man,
That taughte me this tale, as I bigan,
I seye that first with heigh style he enditeth,°
Er he the body of his tale writeth,
A proheme,° in the which discriveth he
Pemond,° and of Saluces° the contree,
And speketh of Apennin,° the hilles hie,
That been the boundes of West Lumbardie,
And of Mount Vesulus in special,
Where as the Poo,° out of a welle° smal,
Taketh his firste springing and his sours,
That estward ay encresseth in his cours
To Emelward,° to Ferrare, and Venise:
The which a long thing were to devise.
And trewely, as to my jugement,
Me thinketh it a thing impertinent,°
Save that he wol conveien° his matere:
But this his tale, which that ye may here.”
