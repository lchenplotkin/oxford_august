¶Woot ye nat° wher ther stant° a litel toun
Which that ycleped is° Bob-up-and-doun,°
Under° the Blee,° in Caunterbury weye?
Ther gan our Hoste for to jape° and pleye,
And seide, “Sirs, what! Dun is in the mire!°
Is ther no man, for preyere ne for hire,°
That wol awake our felawe heer bihinde?
A theef mighte him ful lightly° robbe and binde.
See how he nappeth! see, for cokkes bones,°
As he wol falle from his hors at ones.°
Is that a cook of Londoun, with meschaunce?°
Do him° come forth, he knoweth his penaunce,°
For he shal telle a tale, by my fey!°
Although it be nat worth a botel hey.°
Awake, thou Cook,” quod he, “God yeve° thee sorwe,
What eileth thee° to slepe by the morwe?°
Hastow had fleen° al night, or artow dronke,
Or hastow with som quene° al night yswonke,°
So that thou mayst nat holden up thin heed?”
This Cook, that was ful pale and no thing reed,°
Seid to our Host, “So God my soule blesse,
As ther is falle on me swich hevinesse,°
Noot I° nat why, that me were lever° slepe
Than the beste galoun win in Chepe.”°

¶“Wel” quod the Maunciple, “if it may doon ese°
To thee, sir Cook, and to no wight° displese
Which that heer rideth in this companie,
And that our Host wol, of his curteisie,
I wol as now excuse thee of thy tale;
For, in good feith, thy visage is ful pale,
Thin eyen daswen° eek,° as that me thinketh,°
And wel I woot,° thy breeth° ful soure stinketh,
That sheweth wel thou art not wel disposed;
Of me, certein, thou shalt nat been yglosed.°
Se how he ganeth,° lo, this dronken wight,
As though he wolde us swolwe° anonright.°
Hold cloos thy mouth, man, by thy fader kin!
The devel of helle sette° his foot therin!
Thy cursed breeth infecte wol us alle;
Fy, stinking swin, fy! foule moot thee falle!°
A! taketh heed, sirs, of this lusty° man.
Now, swete sir, wol ye juste atte fan?°
 Therto me thinketh ye been wel yshape!°
I trowe° that ye dronken han win ape,°
And that is whan men pleyen with a straw.”°

¶And with this speech the cook wex wrooth and wraw,°
And on the Maunciple he gan nodde° faste°
For lakke of speche, and doun the hors him caste,
Wher as he lay, til that men up him took;
This was a fair chivachee° of a cook!

¶Allas! he nadde holde him by° his ladel!°
And, er that he again were in his sadel
Ther was greet showving° bothe to and fro,
To lifte him up, and muchel care and wo,
So unweldy° was this sory palled gost.°
And to the Maunciple than spak oure Host,
“Bicause drink hath dominacioun
Upon this man, by my savacioun
I trowe° he lewedly° wolde telle his tale.
For, were it win, or old or moisty° ale,
That he hath dronke, he speketh in his nose,
And fneseth° faste, and eek he hath the pose.°
He hath also to do more than ynough
To kepe him and his capel° out of slough;°
And, if he falle from his capel eftsone,°
Than shul we alle have ynough to done,°
In lifting up his hevy dronken cors.°
Telle on thy tale, of him make I no fors.°

¶But yet, Maunciple, in feith thou art to nice,°
Thus openly repreve° him of his vice.
Another day he wol, peraventure,°
Reclaime° thee, and bringe thee to lure;°
I mene, he speke wol of smale thinges,
As for to pinchen at° thy rekeninges,
That wer not honeste, if it cam to preef.”°
Quod the Maunciple, “That were a greet mescheef!°
So mighte he lightly° bring me in the snare.
Yet hadde I lever° payen for the mare°
Which he rit° on, than he shold with me strive;°
I wol nat wratthe° him, also mote I thrive!°
That that I spak, I seide it in my bourde;°
And wite° ye what? I have heer, in a gourde,°
A draught of win, ye, of a ripe grape,
And right anon ye shul seen a good jape.°
This Cook shal drinke therof, if I may;
Up° peine of deeth, he wol nat seye° me nay!”
And certeinly, to tellen as it was,°
Of this vessel the Cook drank faste,° allas!
What neded him? he drank ynough° biforn.
And whan he hadde pouped° in this horn,
To the Maunciple he took° the gourde again;
And of that drink the Cook was wonder fain,°
And thanked him in swich wise as he coude.

¶Than gan our Host to laughen wonder loude,
And seide, “I see wel it is necessarie,
Wher that we goon, good drink we with us carie;
For that wol turne rancour and disese°
T’acord° and love, and many a wrong apese.°
O thou Bachus,° yblessed be thy name,
That so canst turnen ernest° into game!
Worship and thank be to thy deitee!
Of that matere ye get namore of me.
Tel on thy tale, Maunciple, I thee preye.”°
“Wel sir,” quod he, “now herkneth what I seye.”
