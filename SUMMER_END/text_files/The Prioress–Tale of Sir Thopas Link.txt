Whan seid° was al this miracle, every man
As sobre° was, that wonder was to se,
Til that our Hoste japen° tho bigan,
And thanne at erst° he loked upon me,
And seide thus, “what man artow?”° quod he;
“Thou lokest as thou woldest° finde an hare,
For ever° upon the ground I see thee stare.
Approche neer, and looke up murily.°
Now war yow,° sirs, and lat this man have place;
He in the wast° is shape° as wel as I;
This were a popet° in an arm t’enbrace°
For any womman, smal° and fair of face.
He semeth elvish° by his contenaunce,°
For unto no wight° dooth he daliaunce.°
Sey now somwhat,° sin other folk han said;
Tel us a tale of mirthe, and that anoon”;°—

“Host,” quod I, “ne beth nat ivel apaid,°
For other tale certes can I noon,°
But° of a rim I lerned longe agoon.”
“Ye, that is good,” quod he; “now shul we here
Som deintee° thing, me thinketh by his chere.”°
