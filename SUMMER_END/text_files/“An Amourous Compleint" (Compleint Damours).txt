I, which that am the sorwefullest man
That in this world was ever yit livinge,
And leest recoverer of° himselven can,°
Begin right thus my deedly° compleininge
On hir, that may to lif and deeth me bringe,
Which° hath on me no mercy ne no routhe°
That° love hir best, but sleeth° me for my trouthe.°
 
Can I noght doon ne seyn that° may yow like,
Ne° certes, now,° allas! allas the while!°
Your plesaunce° is to laughen whan I sike,°
And thus ye me from al my blisse° exile.
Ye han me cast in thilke spitouse° ile°
Ther° never man on live° might asterte;°
This have I° for° I love you, swete herte!
 
Soth° is, that wel I woot, by liklinesse,
If that it were thing possible to do
Tʼacompte° youre beutee and goodnesse,
I have no wonder though ye do me wo;°
Sith° I, thʼunworthiest that may ride or go,°
Durste° ever thinken in so hie a place,
What wonder is, thaugh ye do me no grace?
Allas! thus is my lif brought to an ende,
My dethe, I see, is my conclusioun;
I may wel sing, “In sory time° I spende
My lif"; that song may have confusioun!°
For mercy, pitee, and deep affeccioun,
I sey for me, for al my deedly chere,
All thise diden, in that, me love yow° dere.°
 
And in this wise° and in dispaire I live
In love; nay, but in dispaire I die!
But shal I thus to yow° my deth forgive,
That causeles doth° me this sorow drie?°
Ye, certes, I! For she of my folie
Hath nought to done,° although she do me sterve;°
Hit is nat with hir wil that I hir serve!
 
Than sith° I am of my sorow the cause
And sith that I have this,° withoute hir rede,°
Than may I seyn, right shortly in a clause,°
It is no blame unto hir womanhede
Thaugh suche a wrecche as I be for hir deed;
And yette alwey two thinges doon me die,°
That is to seyn, hir beute and min eye.
 
So that, algates,° she is the verray rote°
Of my disese,° and of my dethe also;
For with oon word she mighte be my bote,°
If that she vouched sauf° for to do so.
But why than is hir gladnesse° at my wo?
It is hir wone° plesaunce° for to take,
To seen hir servaunts dyen for hir sake!
 
But certes, thanne is al my wonderinge,
Sithen° she is the fairest creature
As to my dome,° that ever was livinge,
The benignest and beste eek° that nature
Hath wrought° or shal, whil that the world may dure,°
Why that she lefte pite so behinde?
It was, ywis,° a greet defaute° in kinde.°
 
Yitte is al this no lak to° hir, pardee,
But God or nature sore° wolde I blame;
For, though she shew no pitee unto me,
Sithen that° she doth othere men the same,
I ne oughte to despise my ladies game;
It is hir pley to laughen whan men siketh,°
And I assente,° al that hir list° and liketh!
 
Yit wolde I, as I dar, with sorwful herte
Biseche unto° your meke womanhede°
That° I now durst° my sharpe sorwes smerte°
Shew by word, that ye wolde ones rede°
The pleinte of me,° the which ful sore drede°
That I have said here, thrugh min unkonninge,°
In any worde to your displesinge.°
 
Lothest° of anything that ever was lothe
Were me,° as wisly God my sowle save,
To seyne a thing through which ye might be wrothe;°
And, to° that day that I be leide in grave,
A trewer servaunt shul ye never have;
And, though that I on° yow have pleined here,
Forgiveth it me, min owne lady dere!
 
Ever have I been, and shal, how so° I wende,°
Outher° to live or die, youre humble trewe;
Ye ben to me my ginninge° and min ende,
Sonne of the sterre bright° and cler° of hewe,
Alwey in oon° to love yow freshly newe,
By God and by my trowthe, is min entente;
To live or die, I wolle it never repente!
 
This compleint on Seint Valantines day,
Whan every foule chesen° shal his make,
To hir, whos I am hole,° and shal° alwey,
This woful songe and this compleint I make,
That° never yit wold me to mercy take;°
And yit wolle I forevermore her serve
And love hir best, althogh she do me sterve.°
