Tobroken° been the statuts° hie° in hevene
That creat° were eternaly to dure,°
Sith that° I see the brighte goddes sevene
Mow° wepe and waile, and passion° endure,
As may in° erthe a mortal creature.
Allas, fro whennes° may this thing procede?°
Of° whiche errour° I deie almost for drede.°
 
By worde eterne° whilom° was hit shape°
That fro° the fifte cercle,° in no maner,°
Ne might° a drope of teres down escape.
But now so wepeth Venus in hir spere,°
That with hir teres she wol drenche° us here.
Allas, Scogan! this is for thin offence!
Thou causest° this deluge of pestilence.°
 
Hastow° not seid, in blaspheme° of this goddes,°
Through pride, or through thy grete rekelnesse,°
Swich° thing as in the lawe of love forbode° is?
That, for° thi lady sawgh° nat thi distresse,
Therfor thou yave hir up° at Michelmesse!°
Allas, Scogan! of° olde folk ne yonge
Was never erst° Scogan blamed for his tonge!
 
Thou drowe° in scorn Cupide eek° to recorde°
Of thilke° rebel° word that thou hast spoken,
For which° he wol no lenger be thy lorde.
And, Scogan, thow° his bowe be nat broken,
He wol nat with his arwes been ywroken°
On thee, ne° me, ne noon° of our figure;°
We shul of him° have neither hurt nor cure.
 
Now certes, frend, I dreed of° thin unhappe,°
Lest for thi gilt the wreche° of Love procede°
On alle hem° that ben hore° and rounde of shape,°
That ben so likly° folk in love to spede.°
Than shal we for our labour han° no mede;°
But wel I wot,° thou wilt answere and saye:
“Lo! olde Grisel° list° to rime° and pleye!”
 
Nay, Scogan, sey not so, for I mʼexcuse,°
God help me so! in no rim,° dowtelees,°
Ne thinke I never of° slep to wak° my muse,°
That rusteth° in my shethe° stille in pees.°
While I was yonge, I putte her forth in prees,°
But al shal passe that men prose° or rime;
Take every man his turne, as for his time.°

Scogan, that knelest° at the stremes° heed
Of grace, of alle honour and worthinesse,
In thʼende of which streme I am dul as deed,°
Forgete° in solitarie wildernesse;
Yet, Scogan, thenke on Tullius° kindenesse,
Minn° thy frend, there° it may fructifie!°
Farwel, and lok thou° never eft° Love defie!
