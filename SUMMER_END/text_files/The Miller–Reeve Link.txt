¶Whan folk had laughen at this nice cas°
Of Absolon and hende° Nicholas,
Diverse folk diversely they seide;
But, for the more part, they loughe° and pleide,
Ne at this tale I saugh no man him greve,°
But it were° only Osewold the Reve,°
Bicause he was of carpenteres craft.
A litel ire° is in his herte ylaft,°
He gan to grucche° and blamed it a lite.°

¶“So theek,”° quod he, “ful wel coude I thee quite°
With blering° of a proud milleres eye,
If that me liste° speke of ribaudie.
But ik° am old, me list not pley for age;
Gras time° is doon, my fodder° is forage,°
This white top° writeth mine olde yeres,
Min herte is also mowled° as min heres,
But if I fare as dooth an open ers;°
That ilke° fruit is ever leng° the wers,°
Til it be roten in mullok° or in stree.
We olde men, I dred, so fare we;
Til we be roten, can we nat be ripe;
We hoppen° ay, whil that the world wol pipe.
For in our wil° ther stiketh ever a nail,°
To have an hoor heed° and a grene tail,°
As hath a leek; for thogh our might° be goon,
Our wil desireth folie ever in oon.°
For whan we may nat doon, than wol we speke;
Yet in our asshen olde is fir yreke.°

¶Four gledes° han we, whiche I shal devise,
Avaunting,° lying, anger, coveitise;°
Thise foure sparkles longen° unto elde.°
Our olde lemes° mow° wel been unwelde,°
But wil° ne shal nat faillen, that is sooth.
And yet ik have alwey a coltes° tooth,
As many a yeer as it is passed henne°
Sin° that my tappe of lif bigan to renne.
For sikerly,° whan I was bore, anon
Deeth drogh° the tappe of lif and leet it gon;
And ever sith hath so the tappe yronne,°
Til that almost al empty is the tonne.°
The streem of lif now droppeth on the chimbe;°
The sely° tonge may wel ringe and chimbe°
Of wrecchednesse that passed is ful yore;°
With olde folk, save dotage,° is namore.”°

¶Whan that our host had herd this sermoning,
He gan to speke as lordly as a king;
He seide, “What amounteth al this wit?°
What shul° we speke alday of holy writ?
The devel made a reve for to preche,
And of a souter,° shipman, or a leche.°
Sey forth thy tale, and tarie nat° the time,
Lo, Depeford! and it is half-way prime.°
Lo, Grenewich, ther many a shrewe° is inne;
It were al time thy tale to biginne.”

¶“Now, sires,” quod this Osewold the Reve,
“I pray yow alle that ye nat yow greve,°
Thogh I answere and somdel sette his howve;°
For leveful° is with force force ofshowve.°
This dronke millere hath ytold us heer,
How that bigiled was a carpenteer,
Peraventure° in scorn, for I am oon.°
And, by your leve,° I shal him quite° anoon;
Right in his cherles° termes wol I speke.
I pray to God his nekke mote° breke;
He can wel in min yë° seen a stalke,°
But in his owne he can nat seen a balke.”°
