¶This worthy limitour,° this noble Frere,
He made alwey a maner louring chere°
Upon the Somnour, but for honestee°
No vileins° word as yet to him spak he.
But atte laste he seide unto the Wif,
“Dame,” quod he, “God yeve yow right good lif!
Ye han heer touched,° also moot I thee,°
In scole-matere° greet difficultee;
Ye han seid muche thing right wel, I seye;
But dame, heere as we riden by the weye,
Us nedeth nat to speken but of game,
And lete° auctoritees,° on Goddes name,
To preching and to scole eek of clergie.°
But if it like° to this compaignie,
I wol yow of a somnour° telle a game.°
Pardee,° ye may wel knowe by the name,
That of a somnour may no good be said;
I pray that noon of you be ivele apaid.°
A somnour is a renner up and doun
With mandementz° for° fornicacioun,
And is ybet° at every tounes ende.”

¶Our Host tho spak, “A! sir, ye shold be hende°
And curteis, as a man of youre estaat;°
In compaignie we wol have no debaat.°
Telleth your tale, and lat the Somnour be.”

¶“Nay,” quod the Somnour, “lat him sey to me
What so him list;° whan it comth to my lot,
By God, I shal him quiten° every grot.°
I shal him tellen which a greet honour
It is to be a flatering limitour;
And of many another maner crime
Which nedeth nat rehercen° at this time;
And his office° I shal him telle,° ywis.”

¶Our Host answerde, “Pees, namore of this.”
And after this he seide unto the Frere,
“Tel forth your tale, leve° maister deere.”
