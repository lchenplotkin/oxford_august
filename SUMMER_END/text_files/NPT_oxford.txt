¶A povre widwe, somdel° stape° in age,
Was whilom° dwelling in a narwe° cotage,
Biside a grove, stonding in a dale.°
This widwe, of which I telle yow my tale,
Sin thilke° day that she was last a wif,
In pacience ladde a ful simple lif,
For litel was hir catel° and hir rente;°
By housbondrie,° of such as God hir sente,
She fond° hirself, and eek hir doghtren two.
Three large sowes° had she, and namo,
Three kin,° and eek a sheep that highte° Malle.
Ful sooty was hir bour,° and eek hire halle,
In which she eet ful many a sclendre° meel.
Of poinaunt° sauce hir neded never a deel.°
No deintee° morsel passed thurgh hir throte;
Hir diete was accordant to° hir cote.°
Repleccioun° ne made hir never sik;
Attempree° diete was al hir phisik,°
And exercise, and hertes suffisaunce.°
The goute lette hir nothing° for to daunce,
N’apoplexie° shente° nat hir heed;
No win ne drank she, neither whit ne reed;
Hir bord° was served most with whit and blak,
Milk and broun breed, in which she fond no lak,°
Seind° bacoun, and somtime an ei° or tweie,
For she was as it were a maner° deie.°

¶A yerd° she hadde, enclosed al aboute
With stikkes, and a drie dich withoute,
In which she hadde a cok, hight° Chauntecleer,
In al the land of crowing nas° his peer.
His vois was merier than the mery orgon°
On messdayes° that in the chirche gon;°
Wel sikerer° was his crowing in his logge,°
Than is a clokke, or an abbey orlogge.°
By nature crew° he ech ascencioun°
Of the equinoxial° in thilke° toun;
For whan degrees fiftene were ascended,
Than crew he, that it might nat ben amended.°
His comb was redder than the fin° coral,
And batailed,° as it were a castel wal.
His bile° was blak, and as the jeet° it shoon;
Lik asur° were his legges, and his toon;°
His nailes whitter than the lilie flour,
And lik the burned° gold was his colour.
This gentil° cok hadde in his governaunce
Sevene hennes, for to doon al his plesaunce,°
Which were his sustres° and his paramours,°
And wonder° lik° to him, as of° colours.
Of which the faireste hewed° on hir throte
Was cleped° faire damisel° Pertelote.
Curteis° she was, discreet, and debonaire,
And compaignable, and bar° hirself so faire,°
Sin thilke° day that she was seven night old,
That trewely she hath the herte in hold°
Of Chauntecleer loken° in every lith;°
He loved hir so, that wel was him therwith.°
But such a joy was it to here hem singe,
Whan that the brighte sonne gan to springe,°
In swete accord,° “My lief° is faren° in londe.”°
For thilke° time, as I have understonde,
Bestes and briddes° coude speke and singe.

¶And so bifel° that in a daweninge,°
As Chauntecleer among his wives alle
Sat on his perche, that was in the halle,
And next him sat this faire Pertelote,
This Chauntecleer gan gronen° in his throte,
As man that in his dreem is drecched sore.°
And whan that Pertelot thus herde him rore,°
She was agast,° and seide, “O herte dere,
What eileth° yow, to grone in this manere?
Ye been a verray° sleper, fy for shame!”

¶And he answerde and seide thus, “Madame,
I pray yow, that ye take it nat agrief:°
By God, me met° I was in swich meschief°
Right now, that yet min herte is sore afright.°
Now God,” quod he, “my sweven° recche° aright,°
And keep my body out of foul prisoun!
Me met, how that I romed up and doun
Withinne our yerde, wheras° I saugh a beste,°
Was lik° an hound, and wolde han maad areste
Upon° my body, and wolde han had me deed.
His colour was bitwixe yelwe and reed;
And tipped was his tail, and bothe his eres,
With blak, unlik the remenant of his heres;
His snowte smal, with glowinge eyen° tweie.
Yet of his look for fere almost I deie;
This caused me my groning, doutelees.”

¶“Avoy!”° quod she, “fy on yow, hertelees!°
Allas!” quod she, “For, by that God above,
Now han ye lost min herte and al my love;
I can nat love a coward, by my feith.
For certes, what so° any womman seith,
We al desiren, if it mighte be,
To han housbondes hardy,° wise, and free,°
And secree,° and no nigard,° ne no fool,
Ne him that is agast° of every tool,°
Ne noon avauntour,° by that God above!
How dorst ye° seyn for shame unto your love,
That any thing might make yow aferd?°
Have ye no mannes herte, and han a berd?
Allas! and con ye been° agast of swevenis?°
Nothing, God wot,° but vanitee,° in sweven is.
Swevenes engendren of° replecciouns,°
And ofte of fume,° and of complecciouns,°
Whan humours been to habundant° in a wight.°
Certes this dreem, which ye han met° tonight,
Cometh of the grete superfluitee°
Of youre rede colera,° pardee,
Which causeth folk to dreden° in hir dremes
Of arwes,° and of fir with rede lemes,°
Of grete bestes, that they wol hem bite,
Of contek,° and of whelpes° grete and lite;°
Right as the humour of malencolie°
Causeth ful many a man, in sleep, to crie,
For fere of blake beres, or boles° blake,
Or elles, blake develes wole hem take.
Of othere humours coude I telle also,
That werken° many a man in sleep ful° wo;
But I wol passe as lightly as I can.

¶“Lo Catoun, which that was so wis a man,
Seide he nat thus, ne do no fors of° dremes?
Now, sire,” quod she, “whan we flee° fro the bemes,°
For Goddes love, as tak som laxatif;
Up° peril of my soule, and of my lif,
I counseil° yow the beste,° I wol nat lie,
That bothe of colere° and of malencolie°
Ye purge° yow; and for ye shul nat tarie,°
Though in this toun is noon apotecarie,°
I shal myself to° herbes techen yow,
That shul ben for your hele,° and for your prow;°
And in our yerd tho° herbes shal I finde,
The whiche° han of hir propretee,° by kinde,°
To purgen yow binethe,° and eek above.°
Forget not this, for Goddes owene love!
Ye been ful colerik° of compleccioun.°
Ware° the sonne in his ascencioun°
Ne find yow nat repleet° of humours hote;
And if it do, I dar wel leye° a grote,°
That ye shul have a fever terciane,°
Or an agu,° that may be youre bane.°
A day or two ye shul have digestives°
Of wormes, er ye take your laxatives,
Of lauriol,° centaure,° and fumetere,°
Or elles of ellebor,° that groweth there,
Of catapuce,° or of gaitres beriis,°
Of erbe ive,° growing in our yerd, that mery° is;
Pekke hem right as they growe, and ete hem in.
Be mery, housbond, for your° fader° kin!
Dredeth no dreem; I can say yow namore.”

¶“Madame,” quod he, “graunt mercy° of° your lore.°
But nathelees, as touching° daun Catoun,
That hath of wisdom such a greet renoun,
Though that he bad no dremes for to drede,
By God, men may in olde bokes rede°
Of many a man, more of auctoritee°
Than ever Catoun was, so mote I thee,°
That al the revers seyn of his sentence,
And han wel founden by experience,
That dremes ben significaciouns,°
As wel of joye as tribulaciouns
That folk enduren in this lif present.
Ther nedeth° make of this noon argument;
The verray° preve° sheweth it in dede.

¶“Oon of the gretteste auctours° that men rede
Seith thus, that whilom° two felawes wente
On pilgrimage, in a ful good entente;
And happed so,° thay come into a toun,
Wheras° ther was swich congregacioun°
Of peple, and eek so streit° of herbergage,°
That they ne founde as muche as o° cotage,
In which they bothe mighte ylogged° be.
Wherfor thay mosten,° of necessitee,
As for that night, departen° compaignie;
And ech of hem goth to his hostelrie,°
And took his logging as it wolde falle.°
That oon of hem° was logged in a stalle,
Fer° in a yerd,° with oxen of the plough;
That other man was logged wel ynough,
As was his aventure,° or his fortune,
That us governeth alle as in commune.°

¶“And so bifel that, longe er° it were day,
This man mette in his bed, theras° he lay,
How that his felaw gan upon him calle,
And seide, ‘Allas! for in an oxes stalle
This night I shal be mordred ther° I lie.
Now help me, dere brother, er I die;
In alle haste com to me,’ he saide.
This man out of his sleep for fere abraide;°
But whan that he was wakned of his sleep,
He turned him, and took of this no keep;°
Him thoughte° his dreem nas but° a vanitee.°
Thus twyës in his sleping dremed he.
And atte° thridde time yet his felawe
Cam,° as him thoughte, and seide, ‘I am now slawe;°
Bihold my blody woundes, depe and wide!
Aris up erly in the morwe tide,°
And at the west gate of the toun,’ quod he,
‘A carte ful of dong ther shaltow° see,
In which my body is hid ful prively;°
Do thilke° carte aresten° boldely.
My gold caused my mordre, sooth° to sayn’;
And tolde him every point° how he was slain,
With a ful pitous face, pale of hewe.
And truste wel his dreem he fond° ful trewe;
For on the morwe, as sone as it was day,
To his felawes in° he took the way;
And whan that he cam to this oxes stalle,
After his felawe he bigan to calle.

¶“The hostiler° answered him anon,
And seide, ‘Sire, your felawe is agon,°
As sone as day he wente out of the toun.’

¶“This man gan fallen in suspecioun,°
Remembring on his dremes that he mette,°
And forth he goth, no lenger wolde he lette,°
Unto the west gate of the toun, and fond
A dong-carte, as it were to donge° lond,
That was arrayed° in the same wise
As ye han herd the dede man devise;°
And with an hardy° herte he gan to crie°
Vengeaunce and justice of this felonie:—
‘My felaw mordred is this same night,
And in this carte he lith° gapinge° upright.°
I crie out on° the ministres,’° quod he,
‘That sholden kepe° and reulen this citee;
Harrow!° allas! her lith my felaw slain!’
What sholde I more unto this tale sayn?
The peple outsterte,° and caste the cart to grounde,
And in the middel of the dong they founde
The dede man, that mordred was al newe.°

¶“O blisful God, that art so just and trewe!
Lo, how that thou biwreyest° mordre always!
Mordre wol out,° that see we day by day.°
Mordre is so wlatsom° and abhominable
To God, that° is so just and resonable,
That he ne wol nat suffre° it heled° be;
Though it abide° a yeer, or two, or three,
Mordre wol out, this my conclusioun.
And right anoon, ministres of that toun
Han hent° the carter, and so sore him pined,°
And eek the hostiler so sore engined,°
That thay biknewe° hir wikkednesse anoon,
And were anhanged° by the nekke-boon.

¶“Heer may men seen that dremes been to drede.°
And certes, in the same book I rede,
Right in the nexte chapitre after this,
(I gabbe° nat, so have I° joye or blis),
Two men that wolde han passed over see,
For certein cause, into a fer contree,
If that the wind ne hadde been° contrarie,
That made hem in a citee for to tarie,
That stood ful mery upon an haven-side.°
But on a day, again° the eventide,°
The wind gan chaunge, and blew right as hem leste.°
Jolif° and glad they wente unto hir reste,
And casten hem° ful erly for to saille;

¶“But to that oo man° fil° a greet mervaille.
That oon of hem, in sleping as he lay,
Him mette° a wonder dreem, again the day;°
Him thoughte a man stood by his beddes side,
And him comaunded, that he sholde abide,°
And seide him thus, ‘If thou tomorwe wende,°
Thou shalt be dreint;° my tale is at an ende.’

¶“He wook,° and tolde his felaw what he mette,°
And preide him° his viage for to lette;°
As for that day, he preide him to abide.°
His felaw, that lay by his beddes side,
Gan for to laughe, and scorned° him ful faste.°
‘No dreem,’ quod he, ‘may so min herte agaste,°
That I wol lette° for to do my thinges.°
I sette° not a straw by thy dreminges,
For swevenes° been but vanitees and japes.°
Men dreme alday of owles or of apes,
And eke of many a mase° therwithal;
Men dreme of thing that never was ne shal.°
But sith° I see that thou wolt heer abide,
And thus forsleuthen° wilfully thy tide,°
God wot° it reweth me;° and have good day.”
And thus he took his leve, and wente his way.
But er that he had halfe his cours yseiled,°
Noot I nat° why, ne what mischaunce it eiled,°
But casuelly° the shippes botme rente,°
And ship and man under the water wente
In sighte of othere shippes it biside,
That with hem seiled at the same tide.

¶“And therfor, faire Pertelot so dere,
By swiche ensamples olde maistow lere,°
That no man sholde been to° recchelees°
Of dremes, for I sey thee, doutelees,°
That many a dreem ful sore° is for to drede.

¶“Lo, in the lif of Seint Kenelm, I rede,
That was Kenulphus son, the noble king
Of Mercenrike,° how Kenelm mette° a thing;
A lite er° he was mordred, on a day,
His mordre in his avisioun° he say.°
His norice° him expouned° every del
His sweven, and bad him for to kepe him wel
For° traisoun; but he nas but° seven yeer old,
And therfore litel tale° hath he told°
Of any dreem, so holy was his herte.
By God, I hadde lever° than my sherte
That ye had rad° his legende, as have I.

¶“Dame Pertelote, I sey yow° trewely,
Macrobeus, that writ° the avisioun
In Affrike of the worthy Cipioun,
Affermeth dremes, and seith that they been
Warning of thinges that men after seen.
And forthermore, I pray yow loketh° wel
In the Olde Testament, of Daniel

Whoso wol seken actes° of sondry° remes,°
May rede of dremes many a wonder thing.

¶“Lo Cresus, which that was of Lyde king,

Lo heer Andromacha, Ectores wif,
That day that Ector sholde lese° his lif,
She dremed on the same night biforn,
How that the lif of Ector shuld° be lorn,°
If thilke° day he wente into bataille;
She warned him, but it might nat availle;°
He wente for to fighte nathelees,
But he was slain anoon of° Achilles.
But thilke tale is al to long to telle,
And eek it is ny day, I may nat dwelle.°
Shortly I seye, as for conclusioun,
That I shal han of this avisioun°
Adversitee; and I seye forthermore,
That I ne telle of laxatives no store,°
For they ben venimous,° I woot it wel;
I hem defie,° I love hem never a del.°

¶“Now let us speke of mirthe, and stinte° al this;
Madame Pertelot, so have I blis,
Of o° thing God hath sent me large grace;°
For whan I see the beautee of your face,
Ye ben so scarlet reed about your yën,°
It maketh al my drede for to dien;
For, also siker° as In principio,°
Mulier est hominis confusio;°
Madame, the sentence° of this Latin is—
Womman is mannes joye and al his blis.
For whan I fele anight° your softe side,
Albeit that I may nat on you ride,°
For that° our perche is maad so narwe, alas!
I am so ful of joye and of solas°
That I defye both sweven and dreem.”

¶And with that word he fley° doun fro the beem,
For it was day, and eek his hennes alle;
And with a chuk° he gan hem for to calle,
For he had founde a corn,° lay in the yerd.
Royal he was, he was namore aferd;°
He fethered° Pertelote twenty time,
And trad° as ofte, er that it was prime.°
He loketh° as it were a grim° leoun;
And on his toos he rometh up and doun,
Him deined not to sette his foot to grounde.
He chukketh,° whan he hath a corn yfounde,
And to him rennen° thanne his wives alle.
Thus royal, as a prince is in his halle,
Leve I this Chauntecleer in his pasture;°
And after wol I telle his aventure.

¶Whan that the month in which the world bigan,
That highte° March, whan God first maked man,
Was complet,° and passed were also,
Sin March bigan, twey monthes and dayes two
Bifel that Chauntecleer, in al his pride,
His seven wives walking by his side,
Caste up his eyen to the brighte sonne,
That in the signe of Taurus hadde yronne°
Twenty degrees and oon, and somwhat more;
And knew by kinde,° and by noon other lore,°
That it was prime, and crew with blisful° stevene.
“The sonne,” he saide, “is clomben° up on hevene
Fourty degrees and oon, and more, ywis.
Madame Pertelot, my worldes blis,
Herkneth° thise blisful briddes° how they singe,
And see the fresshe floures how they springe;
Ful is min herte of revel° and solas.”°

¶But sodeinly him fil° a sorweful cas;°
For ever the latter ende of joye is wo.
God woot that worldly joye is sone ago;°
And if a rethor° coude faire endite,°
He in a cronique saufly° mighte it write,
As for a soverein notabilitee.°
Now every wis man, lat him herkne me;
This storie is also° trewe, I undertake,°
As is the book of Launcelot de Lake,
That wommen holde in ful gret reverence.
Now wol I torne° again to my sentence.°

¶A colfox,° ful of sly iniquitee,°
That in the grove hadde woned° yeres three,
By heigh° imaginacioun° forncast,°
The same night thurghout the hegges brast°
Into the yerd, ther° Chauntecleer the faire
Was wont,° and eek his wives, to repaire;°
And in a bed of wortes° stille he lay,
Til it was passed undern° of the day,
Waiting° his time on Chauntecleer to falle,°
As gladly° doon thise homicides alle,
That in await° liggen° to mordre men.

¶O false mordrer, lurking in thy den!
O newe Scariot,° new Genilon!
False dissimilour,° O Greek Sinon,
That broghtest Troye al outrely° to sorwe!
O Chauntecleer, acursed be that morwe,°
That thou into that yerd flough° fro the bemes!
Thou were ful wel ywarned by thy dremes,
That thilke° day was perilous to thee.

¶But what that God forwoot° mot nedes° be,
After° the opinioun of certein clerkis.
Witnesse on° him, that any perfit° clerk is,
That in scole is gret altercacioun°
In this matere, and greet disputisoun,
And hath ben of an hundred thousand men.
But I ne can not bulte it to the bren,°
As can the holy doctour Augustin,
Or Boece, or the bishop Bradwardin,
Whether that Goddes worthy forwiting°
Streineth° me nedely° for to doon a thing,
(Nedely clepe° I simple necessitee);
Or elles, if free chois be graunted me
To do that same thing, or do it noght,
Though God forwoot° it, er that it was wroght;°
Or if his witing streineth° nevere a del°
But° by necessitee condicionel.
I wol not han to do of° swich matere;
My tale is of a cok, as ye may here,
That took his counseil of° his wif, with sorwe,
To walken in the yerd upon that morwe
That he had met° the dreem, that I yow tolde.
Wommennes counseils been ful ofte colde;°
Wommannes counseil broghte us first to wo,
And made Adam fro paradis to go,
Theras° he was ful mery, and wel at ese.°
But for° I noot,° to whom it might displese,
If I counseil of wommen wolde blame,
Passe over,° for I seide it in my game.°
Rede auctours,° wher they trete of swich matere,°
And what thay seyn of wommen ye may here.
Thise been the cokkes wordes, and nat mine;
I can noon harm of no° womman divine.°

¶Faire in the sond,° to bathe hir merily,
Lith Pertelote, and alle hir sustres by,°
Again° the sonne; and Chauntecleer so free°
Song merier than the mermaide in the see;
For Phisiologus seith sikerly,°
How that° they singen wel and merily.
And so bifel that, as he caste his yë,
Among the wortes,° on a boterflie,
He was war of this fox that lay ful lowe.
Nothing ne liste him° thanne for to crowe,
But cride anon, “cok, cok,” and up he sterte,°
As man that was affrayed° in his herte.
For naturelly a beest desireth flee°
Fro his contrarie,° if he may it see,
Though he never erst° had seyn it with his yë.

¶This Chauntecleer, whan he gan him espie,°
He wolde han fled, but that° the fox anon
Seid, “Gentil sire, allas! Wher wol ye gon?
Be ye affraied of me that am your freend?
Now certes, I were worse than a feend,
If I to yow wold° harm or vileinie.
I am nat come your counseil for t’espie;°
But trewely, the cause of my cominge
Was only for to herkne how that ye singe.
For trewely ye han as mery a stevene°
As eny aungel hath, that is in hevene;
Therwith ye han in musik more felinge°
Than had Boece, or any that can singe.
My lord your fader (God his soule blesse!)
And eek your moder, of hir gentilesse,°

And certes, sire, ful fain° wolde I yow plese.

¶“But for° men speke of singing, I wol saye,
So mote° I brouke wel° min eyen tweie,

As did your fader in the morweninge;
Certes, it was of herte,° al that he song.
And for to make his vois the more strong,
He wold so peine him,° that with bothe his yën
He moste winke,° so loude he wolde crien,
And stonden on his tiptoon° therwithal,°
And strecche forth his nekke long and smal.°
And eek he was of swich discrecioun,
That ther nas no° man in no regioun
That him in song or wisdom mighte passe.°
I have wel rad° in daun Burnel the Asse,
Among his vers,° how that ther was a cok,
For that° a preestes son yaf him a knok°
Upon his leg, whil he was yong and nice,
He made him for to lese his benefice.°
But certein, ther nis no° comparisoun
Bitwix the wisdom and discrecioun
Of youre fader, and of his subtiltee.°
Now singeth, sire, for° seinte charitee,°
Let see, con ye° your fader countrefete?”°

¶This Chauntecleer his winges gan to bete,
As man that coude his tresoun nat espie,°
So was he ravisshed° with his flaterie.

¶Allas! ye lordes, many a fals flatour°
Is in your courtes, and many a losengeour,°
That plesen yow° wel more, by my feith,
Than he that soothfastnesse° unto yow seith.
Redeth Ecclesiaste° of° flaterie;
Beth war,° ye lordes, of hir trecherie.

¶This Chauntecleer stood hie upon his toos,
Strecching his nekke, and heeld his eyen° cloos,°
And gan to crowe loude for the nones;°
And daun Russel the fox sterte° up at ones,
And by the gargat° hente° Chauntecleer,
And on his bak toward the wode him beer,°
For yet ne was ther no man that him sewed.°

¶O destinee, that mayst nat been eschewed!°
Allas, that Chauntecleer fleigh° fro the bemes!
Allas, his wif ne roghte nat of° dremes!
And on a Friday fil al this meschaunce.

¶O Venus, that art goddesse of plesaunce,°
Sin that° thy servant was this Chauntecleer,
And in thy service dide al his° poweer,
More for delit,° than world to multiplie,°
Why woldestow° suffre° him on thy day to die?

¶O Gaufred,° dere maister soverain,°
That, whan thy worthy king Richard was slain
With shot,° compleinedest° his deth so sore,
Why nadde I now° thy sentence° and thy lore,°
The Friday for to chide,° as diden ye?
(For on a Friday soothly° slain was he.)
Than wolde I shewe yow how that I coud pleine°
For Chauntecleres drede, and for his peine.°

¶Certes, swich cry ne lamentacioun
Was never of° ladies maad, whan Ilioun°
Was wonne, and Pirrus with his streite swerd,°
Whan he had hent° king Priam by the berd,
And slain him (as saith us Eneydos),°
As maden alle the hennes in the clos,°
Whan they had seyn° of Chauntecleer the sighte.
But sovereinly° dame Pertelote shrighte,°
Ful louder than did Hasdrubales wif,
Whan that hir housbond hadde lost his lif,
And that the Romains hadden brend° Cartage;
She was so ful of torment and of rage,
That wilfully into the fir she sterte,°
And brende° hirselven with a stedfast° herte.

¶O woful° hennes, right so° criden ye,
As, whan that Nero brende° the citee
Of Rome, criden senatoures wives,
For that° hir housbondes losten alle hir° lives;
Withouten gilt this Nero hath hem slain.

¶Now wol I torne to my tale again:—
This sely° widwe, and eek hir doghtres two,
Herden thise hennes crie and maken wo,
And out at dores sterten° they anoon,
And sien° the fox toward the grove goon,°
And bar° upon his bak the cok away;
And criden, “Out! harrow!° and weilaway!°
Ha, ha, the fox!” and after him they ran,
And eek with staves° many another man;
Ran Colle our dogge, and Talbot, and Gerland,°
And Malkin, with a distaf° in hir hand;
Ran cow and calf, and eek the verray° hogges
So were they fered for° berking° of the dogges
And shouting of the men and wimmen eke,
They ronne so,° hem thoughte° hir herte breke.°
They yelleden° as feendes doon in helle;
The dokes° criden as° men wolde hem quelle;°
The gees for fere flowen° over the trees;
Out of the hive cam the swarm of bees;
So hidous was the noise, a! benedicite!°
Certes,° he Jakke Straw, and his meinee,°
Ne made never shoutes half so shrille,
Whan that they wolden any Fleming kille,
As thilke° day was maad upon the fox.
Of bras thay broghten° bemes,° and of box,°
Of horn, of boon,° in which they blewe and pouped,°
And therwithal thay skriked° and they houped;°
It semed as that° heven sholde falle.

¶Now, gode men, I pray yow herkneth alle!
Lo, how Fortune turneth sodeinly
The hope and pride eek of hir enemy!
This cok, that lay upon the foxes bak,
In al his drede, unto the fox he spak,
And seide, “Sire, if that I were as ye,
Yet sholde° I seyn (as wis God helpe° me),
‘Turneth again,° ye proude cherles° alle!
A verray° pestilence° upon yow falle!
Now am I come unto this wodes side,
Maugree your heed,° the cok shal heer abide;°
I wol him ete in feith,° and that anon.’ ”°—

¶The fox answerde, “In feith, it shal be don,”—
And as he spak that word, al sodeinly
This cok brak° from his mouth deliverly,°
And heighe upon a tree he fleigh° anon.
And whan the fox saugh that he was ygon,
“Allas!” quod he, “O Chauntecleer, allas!
I have to yow,” quod he, “ydoon trespas,°
Inasmuche as I maked yow aferd,°
Whan I yow hente,° and broghte out of the yerd;
But, sire, I dide it in no wikke° entente;
Com doun, and I shal telle yow what I mente.
I shal sey sooth° to yow, God help me so.”

¶“Nay than,”° quod he, “I shrewe° us bothe two,
And first I shrew° myself, both blood and bones,°
If thou bigile° me ofter° than ones.
Thou shalt namore, thurgh thy flaterie,
Do me to° singe and winke with min yë.°
For he that winketh, whan he sholde see,
Al wilfully,° God lat° him never thee!”°

¶“Nay,” quod the fox, “but God yeve° him meschaunce,°
That is so undiscreet of° governaunce,°
That jangleth° whan he sholde holde his pees.”°
Lo, swich it is for to be recchelees,°
And necligent, and truste on flaterie.

¶But ye that holden° this tale a folie,°
As of a fox, or of a cok and hen,
Taketh the moralitee, goode men.
For Seint Paul seith, that al that writen is,
To° our doctrine it is ywrite,° ywis.°
Taketh the fruit, and lat the chaf° be stille.
Now, goode God, if that it be° thy wille,
As seith my lord, so make us al good men;
And bringe us to his heighe blisse. Amen.
