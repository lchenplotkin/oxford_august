¶Whan ended was my tale of Melibee,
And of Prudence and hir benignitee,°
Our Hoste seide, “As I am faithful° man,
And by the precious corpus Madrian,°
I hadde lever° than a barel ale
That Goodelief my wif had herd this tale!
For she nis no thing° of swich pacience
As was this Melibeus wif Prudence.
By Goddes bones! whan I bete° my knaves,°
She bringth me forth the grete clobbed° staves,°
And crieth, ‘Slee the dogges everichoon,
And brek hem, bothe bak and every boon.’

¶“And if that any neighebor of mine
Wol nat in chirche to my wif encline,°
Or be so hardy° to hir to trespace,°
Whan she comth hoom, she rampeth° in my face,
And cryeth, ‘False coward, wreek° thy wif,
By corpus bones!° I wol have thy knif,
And thou shalt have my distaf and go spinne!’
Fro day to night right thus she wol biginne;
‘Allas!’ she seith, ‘that ever I was shape°
To wedde a milksop° or a coward ape,°
That wol be overlad° with every wight!
Thou darst nat stonden by thy wives right!’

¶“This is my lif, but if that° I wol fighte;
And out at dore anon I moot me dighte,°
Or elles I am but lost, but if that I
Be lik a wilde leoun foolhardy.
I woot wel she wol do me slee° som day
Som neighebor, and thanne go my wey.
For I am perilous with knif in honde,
Al be it that I dar nat hir withstonde,
For she is big° in armes, by my feith,
That shal he find, that hir misdooth° or seith.
But lat us passe awey° fro this matere.

¶“My lord the Monk,” quod he, “be mery of chere;
For ye shul telle a tale trewely.
Lo! Rouchestre stant° heer faste by!
Rid forth, min owene lord, brek° nat our game,
But, by my trouthe, I knowe nat your name,
Wher shal I° calle yow my lord dan John,
Or dan Thomas, or elles dan Albon?
Of what hous° be ye, by your fader kin?°
I vow to God, thou hast a ful fair skin,
It is a gentil° pasture ther° thou goost;°
Thou art nat lik a penaunt° or a goost.
Upon my feith, thou art som officer,
Som worthy sextein,° or som celerer,°
For by my fader soule, as to my doom,°
Thou art a maister° whan thou art at hoom;
No poure cloisterer,° ne no novis,°
But a governour, wily° and wis.
And therwithal of brawnes° and of bones
A welfaring° persone for the nones.°
I pray to God, yeve him confusioun
That first thee broghte unto religioun;°
Thou woldest han been a tredefoul° aright.
Haddestow° as greet a leve,° as thou hast might
To parfourne al thy lust° in engendrure,°
Thou haddest° bigeten ful many a creature.
Alas! why werestow° so wid° a cope?°
God yeve me sorwe! but, and° I were a pope,
Not only thou, but every mighty man,
Thogh he were shorn ful hie upon his pan,°
Sholde have a wif; for al the world is lorn!°
Religioun hath take up al the corn°
Of treding,° and we borel° men ben shrimpes!°
Of feble trees ther comen wrecched impes.°
This maketh that° our heires been so sclendre°
And feble, that they may nat wel engendre.°
This maketh that our wives wol assaie°
Religious folk, for ye may bettre paye
Of Venus payements than mowe we;
God woot, no lussheburghes° payen ye!
But be nat wrooth, my lord, for that I pleye;°
Ful ofte in game a sooth° I have herd seye.”

¶This worthy monk took al in pacience,
And seide, “I wol doon al my diligence,
As fer as souneth into° honestee,
To telle yow a tale, or two, or three.
And if yow list° to herkne hiderward,°
I wol yow seyn the lif of Seint Edward;
Or elles first tragedies wol I telle
Of whiche I have an hundred in my celle.°
Tragedie is to seyn a certein storie,
As olde bokes maken us memorie,°
Of him that stood in greet prosperitee
And is yfallen out of° heigh degree°
Into miserie, and endeth wrecchedly.
And they ben versified comunely°
Of six feet, which men clepe exametron.°
In prose eek been endited° many oon,
And eek in metre, in many a sondry wise.°
Lo! this declaring° oughte ynough suffise.

¶Now herkneth, if yow liketh for to here;
But first I yow biseke° in this matere,
Though I by ordre telle nat thise thinges,
Be it of popes, emperours, or kinges,
After° hir ages,° as men writen finde,
But telle hem som bifore and som bihinde,
As it now comth unto my remembraunce;°
Have me excused of° min ignoraunce.”
