¶Our Hoste gan to swere as he° were wood,°
“Harrow!”° quod he, “by nailes and by blood!
This was a fals cherl° and a fals justise!°
As shamful deeth as herte may devise°
Come to thise juges and hir advocats!°
Algate° this sely° maide is slain, allas!
Allas! to dere° boghte° she beautee!
Wherfore I seye al day,° as men may see,
That yiftes° of fortune or of nature
Ben cause of deeth to many a creature.
Hir beautee was hir deeth, I dar wel sayn;
Allas! so pitously as she was slain!
Of bothe yiftes that I speke of now
Men han ful ofte more harm than prow.°
But trewely, min owene maister dere,
This is a pitous tale for to here.

¶“But natheles, passe over,° is no fors;°
I prey to God, so save° thy gentil° cors,°
And eek thine urinals° and thy jordanes,°
Thin ipocras,° and eek thy galianes,°
And every boist° ful of thy letuarie;°
God blesse hem, and our lady Seint Marie!
So mot I theen,° thou art a propre° man,
And lik a prelat,° by Seint Ronian!
Seide I nat wel? I can nat speke in terme;°
But wel I woot, thou doost° my hert to erme,°
That I almost have caught a cardinacle.°
By corpus bones!° but° I have triacle,°
Or elles a draught° of moiste° and corny° ale,
Or but° I here anon° a mery tale,
Min herte is lost for° pitee of this maide.

¶“Thou bel ami,° thou Pardoner,” he seide,
“Tel us som mirthe° or japes° right anon.”
“It shall be doon,” quod he, “by Seint Ronion!
But first,” quod he, “heer at this ale stake°
I wol both drinke, and eten° of a cake.”°
And right anon the gentils° gonne crie,
“Nay! lat him telle us of no ribaudie;°
Tel us som moral thing, that we may lere°
Som wit,° and thanne wol we gladly here.”
“I graunte, ywis,” quod he, “but I mot thinke
Upon som honest° thing, whil that I drinke.”
