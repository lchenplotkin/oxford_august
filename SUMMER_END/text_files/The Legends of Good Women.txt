¶A thousand times have I herd men telle,
That ther is joye in hevene, and peine in helle;
And I acorde° wel that it is so;
But natheles,° yet wot° I wel also,
That ther nis noon° dwelling in this contree,
That either hath in hevene or helle ybe,°
Ne may of it non other weyes witen,°
But as he hath herd seide, or founde it writen;
For by assay° ther may no man it preve.°
But God forbede but men shoulde leve°
Wel more thing then men han seen with eye!
Men shal° nat wenen° everything a lie
But if° himself it seeth,° or elles° dooth;
For, God wot,° thing° is never the lasse sooth,°
Thogh every wight ne may it nat ysee.
Bernard the monk ne saugh nat al,° parde!°
Than mote we to bokes° that we finde,
Thurgh which that° olde thinges ben in minde.°
And to the doctrine° of these olde wise,°
Yeve° credence, in every skilful wise,
That tellen of° these olde appreved° stories,
Of holinesse, or regnes,° of victories,
Of love, of hate, of other sondry° thinges,
Of whiche I may not maken rehersinges.°
And if that olde bokes were aweye,°
Ylore° were of remembraunce° the keye.
Wel oghte us than honouren and beleve
These bokes, ther° we han non other preve.°
And as for me, thogh that I can° but lite,°
On bokes for to rede I me delite,°
And to hem yeve° I feith and ful credence,°
And in min herte have hem° in reverence
So hertely,° that ther is game° noon
That fro my bokes maketh° me to goon,°
But° it be seldom, on the holyday;°
Save,° certeinly, whan that° the monthe of May
Is come,° and that° I here the foules° singe,
And that the floures ginnen° for to springe,°
Farwel my book and my devocioun!
¶Now have I than swich° a condicioun,
That, of al the floures in the mede,°
Than love I most these floures white and rede,
Swiche° as men callen daisies in our toun.
To hem° have I so great affeccioun,
As I seide erst,° whan comen is the May,
That in my bed ther daweth° me no day
That I nam° uppe, and walking in the mede
To seen this floure agein° the sonne sprede,°
Whan it upriseth erly by° the morwe;°
That blisful sighte softneth al my sorwe,
So glad am I whan that° I have° presence
Of it, to doon° al maner reverence,°
As she, that is of alle floures° flour,°
Fulfilled of al vertue and honour,
And ever ilike° fair, and fresh of hewe;
And I love it, and ever ilike° newe,
And ever shal, til that° min herte die;
Al° swere° I nat, of this I wol nat lie,
Ther loved no wight° hotter° in his live.
And whan that it is eve, I renne blive,°
As sone as ever the sonne ginneth° weste,°
To seen° this flour, how it wol go to reste,
For fere of night, so hateth she derknesse!
 
Hir chere° is pleinly° sprad in the brightnesse
Of the sonne, for ther it wol unclose.°
¶Allas! that I nad° English, rime or prose,
Suffisant° this flour to preise aright!
But helpeth, ye that han conning° and might,°
Ye lovers, that can make of° sentement;°
In this cas oghte ye be° diligent
To forthren° me somwhat in my labour,
Whether ye ben with° leef or with the flour.
For wel I wot,° that ye han herbiforne°
Of making° ropen,° and lad awey the corne;°
And I come after, glening° here and there,
And am ful glad if I may finde an ere°
Of any goodly word that ye han° left.
And thogh it happen me° rehercen° eft°

¶She is the clerness° and the verray° light,

The herte inwith° my sorowful brest yow dredeth,°
And loveth so sore, that ye ben verraily°

¶My besy° gost,° that thursteth° alwey newe°
To seen° this flour so yong, so fresh of hewe,
Constreined me with so gledy° desir,

With dredful° herte and glad devocioun,

Again° the son, that roos° as rede as rose,
That in the brest was of the beste° that day,
That Agenores doghter ladde away.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
And doun on knees anonright° I me sette,°
And, as I coud, this fresshe flour I grette;°
Kneling alwey, til it unclosed was,
Upon the smale softe swote° gras,
That was with floures swote enbrouded° al,°
Of swich° swetnesse and swich odour° overal,
That, for to speke of gomme° or herbe,° or tree,

¶Forgeten had the erthe his pore estate°
Of winter, that him naked made and mate,°
And with his swerd of cold so sore greved;°
Now hath the atempre° sonne al that releved
That naked was, and clad° it new againe.
The smale foules,° of the seson faine,°
That from the panter° and the net ben scaped,°
Upon the fouler,° that hem made awhaped°
In winter and distroyed had hir° brood,
In his despite,° hem thoughte° it did hem good.
To singe of him, and in hir° song despise
The foule cherl° that, for his covetise,°
Had hem° betrayed with his sophistrie.°
This was hir° song—"The fouler we defie,
And al his craft!" And somme songen° clere°

In worshipinge and preisinge of hir° make.°
¶And, for the newe blisful somers° sake,
Upon the braunches ful of blosmes° softe,
In hir delit, they turned hem° ful ofte,°
And songen, “Blessed be Seint Valentin!
For on his day I chees° yow to be min,
Withouten repenting,° min herte swete!”
And therwithal° hir° bekes gonnen mete,°
Yelding° honour and humble obeisaunces°
To love, and diden hire° othere observaunces°
That longeth unto° love and to nature;
Construeth° that as yow list,° I do no cure.°
And tho° that hadde doon unkindenesse°
As dooth the tidif,° for newfangelnesse°—
Besoghte° mercy of hir° trespassinge,°
And humblely songen hir repentinge,
And sworen on the blosmes° to be trewe,
So that hir makes° wolde upon hem rewe,°
And at the° laste maden hire acord.°
Al° found they Daunger° for a time a lord,
Yet Pitee, through his stronge gentil° might,
Forgaf, and made mercy passen° right,°
Through innocence and ruled curtesie.°
But I ne clepe nat° innocence folie,
Ne° fals pitee, for “vertu is the mene,”°
As Etik° saith, in swich° maner I mene.
And thus thise foules, voide° of al malice,
Acordeden° to love, and laften° vice
Of hate, and songen alle of oon acorde,°
“Welcome, somer,° our governour and lorde!”
¶And Zephirus and Flora gentilly°
Yaf° to the floures, softe and tenderly,
Hir° swote breth, and made hem° for to sprede,°
As god and goddesse of the floury mede;°
In which me thoghte° I mighte, day by day,
Dwellen alwey, the joly month of May,
Withouten sleep, withouten mete° or drinke.
Adoun° ful softely I gan to sinke;°
And, leninge on min elbowe and my side,

That men by reson wel° it calle may
The “dayesie" or elles the “ye° of day,”
The emperice° and flour of floures alle.
I pray to God that faire mot she falle,°
And all that° loven floures, for hir sake!
But natheles, ne wene nat° that I make°
In preising of the flour again° the leef,
No more than of the corn° again the sheef:°
For, as to me,° nis lever noon ne tother;°
I nam withholden° yit with never nother.°
Ne I not° who serveth leef, ne who the flour;
Wel brouken° they hir service or labour;
For this thing is al of another tonne,°
Of olde story, er swich° thing was begonne.
¶Whan that° the sonne out of the south gan weste,°
And that° this flour gan close° and goon° to reste
For° derknesse of the night, the which° she dredde,°
Hoom to min hous ful° swiftly I me spedde°
To goon to reste, and erly for to rise,
To seen this flour to sprede,° as I devise.°
And, in a litel herber° that I have,
That benched was° on turves° fresshe ygrave,°
I bad° men sholde me my couche° make;
For deintee° of° the newe someres sake,
I bad hem strawen° floures on my bed.
Whan I was leide,° and had min eyen hed,°
I fel on slepe inwith° an houre or two;
Me met° how I lay in the medew tho,°
To seen this flour that I love so and drede.°
And from afer° com° walking in the mede
The god of love, and in his hande° a quene;
And she was clad° in real° habit° grene.
A fret° of gold she hadde next° hir heer,
And upon that a whit° coroun° she beer
With florouns° smale, and° I shal nat lie;
For al the world, right° as a dayesie
Ycorouned° is with white leves lite,°
So° were the florouns of hir coroun° white;
For of a perle° fine, oriental,
Hir white coroun was ymaked al;°
For which° the white coroune, above the grene,
Made hir lik a daisie for to sene,°
Considered eek° hir fret° of gold above.
Yclothed° was this mighty god of love
In silke, enbrouded° ful of grene greves,°
Inwith° a fret° of rede rose-leves,
The fresshest sin° the world was first bigonne.
¶His gilte° heer was corouned with a sonne,°
Instede of gold, for° hevinesse and wighte;°
Therwith me thoght° his face shoon so brighte
That wel unnethes° mighte I him beholde;
And in his hande me thoughte I saugh him holde
Two firy dartes,° as the gledes rede;°
And aungellike° his winges saugh I sprede.
And al be that° men seyn that blind is he,
Algate° me thoughte° that he mighte see.
For sternely on me he gan biholde,°
So that his loking doth° min herte colde.
¶And by the hande he held this noble quene,
Corouned with white, and clothed al in grene,
So womanly, so benigne,° and so meke,
That in this world, thogh that° men wolde seke,
Half hir beautee shulde men nat finde
In creature that formed is by kinde.°

And therfor may I seyn,° as thinketh me,°
This song, in preising of this lady fre.°

Hide, Absolon, thy gilte° tresses clere;°
Ester, ley thou° thy meknesse al adoun;°
Hide, Jonathas, al thy frendly manere;
Penalopee, and Marcia Catoun,

My lady cometh, that° al this may disteine.°
 
Thy faire body, lat it nat appere,
Lavine; and thou, Lucresse of Rome toun,
And Polixene, that boghten° love so dere,°
And Cleopatre, with al thy passioun,
Hide ye your trouthe° of love and your renoun;
And thou, Tisbe, that hast of love swich° peine;
My lady cometh, that al this may disteine.
 
Hero, Dido, Laudomia, alle yfere,°
And Phyllis, hanging for thy Demophoun,
And Canace, espyed° by thy chere,°
Ysiphile, betraised with° Jasoun,
Maketh of your trouth neither boost° ne soun;°
Nor Ypermistre or Adriane, ye tweine;°
My lady cometh, that al this may disteine.
 
¶This balade may ful° wel ysongen° be,
As I have seid erst,° by° my lady free;°
For certeinly, al these° mow° nat suffise
To apperen° with my lady in no wise.°
For as the sonne wol the fir disteine,°
So passeth° al my lady sovereine,
That is so good, so fair, so debonaire;°
I prey to God that ever falle hir faire!°
For, nadde comfort ben° of° hir presence,
I had° ben deed,° without any defence,°
For drede° of Loves wordes and his chere;°
As, when time is,° herafter ye shal here.
¶Behind this god of love, upon the grene,
I saugh cominge of ladies ninetene
In real° habite,° a ful° esy° paas;°
And after hem come of women swich° a traas,°
That, sin that° God Adam had mad of erthe,
The thridde° part of mankind, or the ferthe,
Ne wende I nat° by possibilitee,°
Had ever in this wide worlde ybe;°
And trewe of love thise women were echoon.°
¶Now whether was that a wonder° thing or noon,°
That, right anoon as that° they gonne espie°
This flour, which that I clepe° the daiesie,
Ful° sodeinly they stinten° alle at ones,°
And kneled doun, as it were for the nones,°
And songen with o° vois, “Hele° and honour
To trouthe° of womanhede, and to this flour
That bereth° our alder pris° in figuringe!°
Hir white coroune berth the witnessinge!"°
¶And with that word, a compas enviroun,°
They setten hem ful softely° adoun.
First sat the god of love, and sith° his quene
With the white coroune, clad in grene;
And sithen° al the remenaunt° by and by,°
As they were of estaat,° ful curteisly;
Ne nat° a word was spoken in the place
The mountaunce° of a furlongwey of space.°
¶I kneling by this floure, in good entente°
Abood,° to knowen what this peple mente,°
As stille as any stoon; til at the laste,
This god of love on me his eyen caste,°
And seid, “Who kneleth there"? and I answerde
Unto his asking,° whan that I it herde,
And seid, “Sir, hit am I" and com him nere,°
And salued° him. Quod he, “What dostow° here
So nigh° min owne flour, so boldely?
For it were better worthy,° trewely,
A worm to neghen neer° my flour than thou.”
“And why, sir,” quod I, “and it like yow?"°
“For thou,” quod he, “art therto° nothing° able.°
Hit is my relik,° digne° and delitable,°
And thou my fo, and al my folk werreyest,°
And of min olde servaunts° thou misseyest,°
And hindrest° hem,° with thy translacioun,
And lettest° folk from hir° devocioun
To serve me, and holdest it folie°
To serve Love. Thou mayst it nat denie;
For in plein text, withouten nede of glose,°
Thou hast translated the Romaunce of the Rose,
That is an heresie ageins° my lawe,
And makest wise folk fro° me withdrawe.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
And of Criseyde thou hast seid as thee liste,°

Of° thin answere avise thee° right wele;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For, thogh that thou reneyed° hast my lay,°
As other wrecches han doon° many a day,°
By Seinte Venus, that my moder° is,
If that° thou live, thou shalt repenten this
So cruelly, that it shal wel be sene!"°
¶Tho° spak this lady, clothed al in grene,
And seide, “God, right of° your curtesie,
Ye moten° herknen° if he can replie
Agains° al this that ye have to him meved°
A god ne sholde nat be thus agreved,°
But of his deitee° he shal be stable,°
And therto° gracious and merciable.°
And if ye nere° a god, that° knowen al
Than mighte it be, as I yow tellen shal:
This man to° you may falsly ben accused,
Ther as° by right him oghte ben excused.
For in your court is many a losengeour,°
And many a queint° totelere° accusour,
That tabouren° in your eres° many a soun,

Or him was boden° maken° thilke tweie°

Despit of° love, and had himself it wroght.°
This shulde a rightwis° lord have in his thoght,

As is a fermour,° to doon the harm he can.°
He moste thinke it is his lige man,°
 
 
 
 
And is his tresour, and his gold in cofre.°
This is the sentence of the Philosophre:°
A king to kepe his liges° in justice;°
Withouten doute, that is his office.°
 
 
Al wol° he kepe his lordes high degree,
As it is right and skilful° that they be
Enhaunced° and honoured, and most dere—
For they ben half goddes in this world here—
Yit mot° he doon bothe right, to pore and riche,
Al be that° hire° estat be nat yliche,°
And han of° pore folk compassioun.
For lo,° the gentil° kind° of the leoun!
For whan a flie offendeth him or biteth,

Al esily;° for, of° his genterie,°

As doth a curre° or elles another beste.°
In noble corage° oghte ben° areste,
And weyen° every thing by° equitee,°
And ever have reward° to his owen degree.°
For, sir, it is no maistrie° for a lorde
To dampne° a man without answere of worde;°
And, for a lord, that is ful foul° to use.°
And if so be° he may him° nat excuse,
But asketh mercy with a dredful° herte,
And profreth° him, right in his bare sherte,°
To ben right at° your owne jugement,

For sith no cause of deeth lith in this cas,

¶The man hath served yow of his conning,°
And forthred° wel your lawe in° his making.°
 
 
Al be it that° he can nat wel endite,°
Yet hath he maked lewed° folk delite
To serve you, in preising of your name.
He made the book that hight° the Hous of Fame,
And eek° the Deeth of Blaunche the Duchesse,
And the Parlement of Foules,° as I gesse,
And al the love of Palamon and Arcite
Of Thebes, thogh the story is knowen lite;°
And many an impne° for your halidayes,°
That highten° balades, roundels, virelaies;
And, for to speke of other° holynesse,
He hath in° prose translated Boece,
 
 
 
And mad the Lif° also of Seint Cecile;
He made also, goon is a grete whil,°
Origenes upon° the Maudeleine;
Him oghte now to have the lesse° peine;
He hath mad° many a lay° and many a thinge.°
“Now as ye be a god, and eek° a kinge,

But he shal maken,° as ye wil devise,°
Of° wommen trewe in lovinge al hir live,°
Wherso° ye wil,° of maiden or of wive,
And forthren° yow, as muche as he misseide°
Or° in the Rose or elles° in Creseyde.”
¶The god of love answerde hir thus anoon,°
“Madame,” quod he, “hit is so long agoon°
That° I yow knew so° charitable and trewe,°
That never yit, sith that° the world was newe,
To me ne fond° I better noon° than ye.
If that I wolde save° my degree,°

For whoso yeveth° a yift,° or doth a grace,°

And demeth° ye what he shal do therfore.
¶"Go thanke now my lady heer,” quod he.
I roos, and doun I set me on my knee,
And seide thus: “Madame, the God above
Foryelde° yow, that ye the god of love
Han maked° me his wrathe to foryive;
And yeve° me grace so longe for to live,
That I may knowe soothly° what ye be
That han me holpe° and put in this degree.°
But trewely I wende,° as in this cas,
Naught have agilt,° ne doon to° love trespas.°
Forwhy° a trewe man, withouten drede,°
Hath nat to parten with° a theves° dede;
Ne° a trew lover oght me nat to blame,
Thogh that° I speke° a fals lover som shame.
They oghte rather with me for to holde,°
For that° I of Creseyde wroot or tolde,
Or of the Rose; whatso° min auctour° mente,°
Algate,° God wot,° it was min entente
To forthren° trouthe in love and it cherice;
And to be war fro falsnesse and fro° vice
By swich ensample;° this was my meninge.”
¶And she answerd, “Lat be° thin arguinge;
For Love ne wol nat countrepleted° be
In right ne° wrong; and lerne that of° me!
Thou hast thy grace,° and hold thee right therto.°
Now wol I seyn what penance thou shalt do
For thy trespas, and understonde it here:
Thou shalt, whil that° thou livest, yeer by yere,
The moste partie° of thy time spende
In making of° a glorious legende
Of gode wommen, maidenes and wives,
That weren trewe in lovinge al hir° lives;
And telle of false men that hem bitrayen,°
That al hir lif ne doon nat° but assayen°
How many wommen they may doon a shame;°
For in your court that is now holde° a game.
And thogh thee like nat° a lover be,°
Spek wel of love; this penance yive° I thee.
And to the god of love I shal so preye,
That he his servants charge° by° any weye,
To forthren° thee, and wel thy labour quite;°
Go now thy wey, this penance is but lite°
And whan this book is maad, yive it° the quene
On my behalfe, at Eltham, or at Shene.”
¶The god of love gan smile, and than he seide,
“Wostow,”° quod he, “wher° this be wif or maide,
Or quene, or countesse, or of what degree,°
That hath so litel penance yiven° thee,
That° hast deserved sorer° for to smerte?°
But pitee renneth sone° in gentil° herte;
That maystow° seen, she kitheth° what she is.”
And I answerd, “Nay, sir, so have I blis,°
No more but° that I see wel she is good.”
“That is a trewe tale, by min hood,”°
Quod Love, “And that thou knowest wel, pardee,°
If it be so that thou avise thee.°
Hastow nat° in a book, lith° in thy cheste,
The grete goodnesse° of the quene Alceste,
That° turned was into a dayesie:
She that° for hir husbonde chees° to die,
And eek° to goon to hell, rather than he,
And Ercules rescowed° hir, pardee,°
And broghte hir out of helle again to blis?"°
And I answerde agein, and seide, “Yis,
Now knowe I hir! And is this good Alceste,
The daiesie, and min owne hertes reste?°
Now fele° I wel the goodnesse of this wif,
That bothe after hir deeth, and in hir lif,
Hir grete bountee° doubleth hir renoun!
Wel hath she quit° me min affeccioun
That I have to hir flour, the dayesie!
No wonder is thogh Jove hir stellifie,°
As telleth Agaton, for hir goodnesse!
Hir white coroune berth of° it witnesse;
For also° many vertues hadde she,
As smale floures in hir coroune be.
In remembraunce of hir and in honoure,
Cibella made the daiesy and the floure
Ycoroned° al with whit, as men may see;
And Mars yaf° to hir coroun reed,° pardee,°
In stede of rubies, set among the white.”
¶Therwith this quene wex° reed for shame a lite,°
Whan she was preised so in hir presence.
Than seide Love, “A ful° gret negligence
Was it to thee, that ilke time° thou made
‘Hid, Absolon, thy tresses,’ in balade,
That thou forgat° hir in thy song to sette,°
Sin° that thou art so gretly in hir dette,°
And woste° wel, that kalender° is she
To any woman that wol° lover be.
For she taughte al the craft of fin° lovinge,
And namely of° wifhood the livinge,°
And al the boundes° that she oghte kepe;°
Thy litel wit was thilke time° aslepe.
But now I charge° thee, upon thy lif,
That in thy legend thou make of° this wif,
Whan thou hast other smale° ymaad° before;
And fare now wel, I charge° thee no more.
¶"But er° I go, thus muche I wol thee telle,
Ne shal no° trewe lover come in helle.
Thise other ladies sittinge here arowe°
Ben in thy balade, if thou canst hem knowe,°
And in thy bokes al thou shalt hem° finde;
Have hem now in thy legend alle in minde,
I mene of hem° that been in thy knowinge.°
For heer ben twenty thousand mo° sittinge
Than thou knowest, that been good wommen alle
And trewe of love, for aught° that may befalle;°
Make the metres° of hem° as thee leste.°
I mot° gon hoom, the sonne draweth° weste,
To Paradis, with al this companie;
And serve alwey the fresshe dayesie.
¶"At Cleopatre I wol that° thou beginne;
And so forth; and my love so shalt thou winne.
For lat see now what man that lover be,°
Wol doon° so strong a peine for love as she.
I wot° wel that thou mayst nat al it rime,°
That° swiche° lovers diden in hir time;
It were° to long to reden° and to here;
Sufficeth me,° thou make° in this manere,
That thou reherce° of al hir lif the grete,°
After° thise olde auctours listen trete.°
For whoso° shal so many a storie telle,
Sey shortly,° or he shal to longe dwelle."°
¶And with that word my bokes gan I take,°
And right thus° on my legend gan I make.

¶A thousent sithes° have I herd men telle,
That ther is joye in hevene, and peine in helle;
And I acorde wel that it is so;
But natheles, this wot I wel also,
That ther nis noon that dwellith in this cuntre,
That either hath in helle or hevene ybe,
Ne may of it non other weyes witen,
But as he hath herd seid, or founde it writen;
For by assay ther may no man it preve.
But God forbode but men shulde leve
Wel more thing then men han seyn with eye!
Men shal nat wenen every thing a lie
For that he say it nat of yore ago;°
God wot, a thing is never the lesse so,
Thogh every wight ne may it nat ysee.
Bernard the monk ne say nat al, parde!,
Than moten we to bokes that we finde,
Through which that olde thinges been in minde.
And to the doctrine of these olde wise,
Yeven credence, in every skilful wise,
And trowen on° these olde aproved stories
Of holinesse, of regnes, of victories,
Of love, of hate, of other sundry thinges,
Of whiche I may not make rehersinges.
¶And if that olde bokes were aweye,
Yloren were of remembraunce the keye.
Wel oghte us than on olde bokes leve
There as° ther is non other assay° by preve.
And as for me, thogh that min wit° be lite,
On bokes for to rede I me delite,
And in min herte have hem in reverence
And to hem yeve° swich lust° and swich credence,°
That there is wel unethe° game non
That from my bokes make me to goon,
But it be other° upon the haliday;
Or elles° in the joly time of May
When that° I here the smale foules singe,
And that the floures ginne for to springe,
Farwel my stodie as lasting° that sesoun.
Now have I therto° this condicioun,
That, of al the floures in the mede,
Than love I most these floures white and rede,
Swiche as men callen daiesies in our toun.
To hem have I so great afeccioun,
As I seide erst, whan comen is the May,
That in my bed ther daweth me no day
That I nam up, and walking in the mede
To seen these floures agein the sonne sprede,
Whan it upriseth by the morwe shene,°
The longe day, thus walkinge in the grene.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
And whan the sunne ginneth for to weste,°
Than closeth it and draweth it to reste
So sore° it is afered° of the night
Til on the morwe that° it is dayes light.
This dayeseie, of alle floures flour
Fulfild of vertu and of alle honour
And ever ylike fair and fresh of hewe,
As wel in wintir as in somer newe,
Fain° wolde I preisen° if I coude aright.
But wo is me it lith nat in my might!
 
 
 
 
 
¶For wel I wot, that folk han herbeforn
Of making ropen,° and lad awey the corn;
And I come after, glening here and there,
And am ful glad if I may finde an ere
Of any goodly word that they han left.
And if it happe me rehersen eft

I hope that they wil nat ben evel apaid,
Sith° it is seid in forthering° and honour
Of hem,° that either serven lef or flour
For trusteth wel I ne have° undertake

Is for° men shulde autoritees beleve,
Ther as° there lith° non other assay° by preve.°

¶Whan passed was almost the month of May
And I had romed° al the someres day
The grene medew of which that° I yow tolde
Upon the freshe daisy to beholde°
And that the sonne out of the south gan weste,°
And clothed° was the flour and gon° to reste
For° derknesse of the night of which° she dredde°
Hom to min hous ful° swiftly I me spedde°
And in a litil erber° that I have
Ibenched° new with turwes° freshe igrave°
I bad° men shulde me my couche° make
For deinte° of° the newe someres sake
I bad hem strowe° floures on my bed.
¶Whan I was laid° and had min eyen hed°
I fel aslepe withinne an houre or two
Me met° how I was in the medew tho°
And that I romed in that same gise°
To sen that flour as ye han herd devise.°
¶Fair was this medew, as thought me,° overall
With floures sote° enbrouded° was it al
As for to° speke of gomme° or erbe° or tre.
Comparisoun may non ymakede be
For it surmounted plenly alle odoures
And eke of riche beaute alle floures.
Forgeten had the erthe his pore estat
Of winter, that him naked made and mat,
And with his swerd of cold so sore had greved;
Now had the atempre sonne al that releved
And clothed him in grene al newe agein.
The smale foules, of the seson fain,
That from the panter and the net ben skaped,
Upon the fouler, that hem made awhaped
In winter, and distroyed had hir brood,
In his despit, hem thoughte it did hem good
To singe of him, and in hir song despise
The foule cherl that, for his covetise,
Had hem betrayed with his sophistrie.
This was hir song—"The fouler we defie,”
Some songen layes° on the braunchis clere°
Of love and May, that joye it was to here,
In worshipe and in preisinge of hir make.
And of° the newe blisful somers sake,
 
That songen, “Blessed be Seint Valentin!
For at his day I chees yow to be min,
Withouten repenting, min herte swete!”
And therwithal hir bekes gonnen mete,
Yelding honor and humble obeisaunces
And after diden other observaunces
That longeth unto love and to nature;
So eche of hem doth wel to creature.
¶This song to herkne° I dede al min entent°
Forwhy I mette° I wiste° what they ment

Til at the laste a larke song above
“I see,” quod she “the mighty god of love!
Lo! yond° he cometh, I see his winges sprede!”
Tho gan I loken endelong° the mede°
And saw him come, and in his hond a queen,
Clothed in rial° abite° al of grene.
A frette of goold she hadde next hir her
And upon that a whit coroun she ber
With many floures and° I shal nat lie,
For al the world right as the dayesie
Icorouned is with white leves lite.
Swich° were the floures of hir coroun white
For of o° perle fin and oriental
Hir white coroun was ymakid al
For which the whit coroun above the grene
Made hir lik a daisie for to sene,
Considered eek the fret of gold above.
¶Yclothed was this mighty god of love
Of silk ybrouded ful of grene greves.
A garland on his hed of rose leves
Stekid° al with lilie floures newe
But of his face I can not seyn the hewe,
For sekirly° his face shon so brighte
That with the glem astoned was the sighte
A furlongwey° I might him not beholde.°
But at the laste in hande I saw him holde
Two firy dartes as the gledes rede
And aungellich his winges gan he sprede.
And al be that men seyn that blind is he
Algate me thought he mighte wel yse°
For sternely on me he gan beholde
So that his loking doth min herte colde.
¶And by the honde he held the noble queen
Corouned with white and clothed al in grene,
So womanly, so benigne, and so meke,
That in this world, thogh that men wolde seke,
Half hir beautee shulde men nat finde
In creature that formed is by kinde.
Hir name was Alceste the debonaire°
I prey to God that ever fall she faire!°
For ne hadde confort been° of° hire presence,
I had° be ded° withouten ony defence,°
For dred° of Loves wordes and his chere,°
As whan time is,° hereafter ye shal here.
¶Behind this god of love, upon this grene,
I saw cominge of ladies ninetene
In rial° abite° a ful° esy° pas,°
And after hem come of wemen swich° a tras°
That sin that° God Adam had made of erthe
The thredde° part of wemen, ne the ferthe
Ne wende I not° by possibilite°
Had ever in this wide world ybe,°
And trewe of love these wemen were echon.°
Now whether was that a wondir° thing or non°
That, right anon as that° they gonne espie°
This flour, which that I clepe° the daesie.
¶Ful° soddenly they stinten° alle atones,°
And knelede adoun as it were for the nones.°
And after that they wenten in compas°
Daunsinge aboute this flour an esy pas,°
And songen as it were in carolwise,°
This balade whiche that I shal yow devise°

Hid, Absolon, thy gilte tresses clere;
Ester, ley thou thy meknesse al adoun;
Hid, Jonathas, al thy frendly manere;
Penalopee, and Marcia Catoun,
Mak of your wifhod no comparisoun;
Hide ye your beautes, Isoude and Eleine,
Alceste is here, that al that may disteine.
 
Thy faire body, lat it nat appere,
Lavine; and thou, Lucresse of Rome toun,
And Polixene, that boghte love so dere,
Eek Cleopatre, with al thy passioun,
Hide ye your trouthe in love and your renoun;
And thou, Tisbe, that hast for love swich peine;
Alceste is here, that al that may desteine.
 
Herro, Dido, Laudomia, alle in fere,
Eek Phyllis, hanging for thy Demophon,
And Canace, espyed by thy chere,
Ysiphile, betrayed with Jasoun,
Mak of your trouthe in love no bost ne soun;
Nor Ypermistre or Adriane, ne pleine;°
Alceste is here, that al that may desteine.

Upon the softe and swote° grene gras
They setten hem ful softely adoun,
By order alle in compas alle enveroun.°
First sat the god of love, and than this queen
With the white coroun, clad in grene;
And sithen° al the remenant° by and by,°
As they were of degre,° ful curteisly;
Ne nat° a word was spoken in the place
The mountance° of a furlongwey of space.°
¶I lening° faste by° under° a bente°
Abood,° to knowen what this peple mente,°
As stille as any stoon; til at the laste,
The god of love on me his eye caste,
And seid, “Who resteth° ther?" and I answered
Unto his axing,° whan that I him herde,
And seid, “Sir, it am I"; and cam him neer,°
And salwed° him. Quod he, “What dost thow° heer
In min presence and that so boldely?
For it were better worthy,° trewely,
A worm to come in my sight than thou.”
“And why, sir,” quod I, “and it like yow?"°
“For thou,” quod he, “art therto° nothing° able.
My servauntis ben al wise and honourable
Thou art my mortal fo, and me warreyest,°
And of mine olde servaunts° thou misseyest,°
And hindrest° hem,° with thy translacioun,
And lettest° folk to han° devocioun
To serven me, and haldest it folie°
To trust on° me. Thou mayst it nat denie;
For in plein text, it nedeth nat to glose,°
Thou hast translated the Romauns of the Rose,
That is an heresie ageins° my lawe,
And makest wise folk fro° me withdrawe.
And thinkest in thy wit, that is ful cole,°
That he nis but° a verray° proper fole
That loveth paramours° to harde° and hote.
Wel wot° I therby thou beginnest dote°
As olde foles, whan hir° spirit faileth;
Than blame they folk and wit° nat what hem eileth.°
Hast thow nat mad in English eek° the book

Why noldest thow° as wel han° seid goodness
Of wemen as thow hast seid wikedness?
Was there no good mater° in thy minde
Ne° in all thy bokes couldist thow nat° finde

Yis! God wot,° sixty bokes olde and newe
Hast thow thy self, al ful of stories grete,°

Of sundry wemen, which lif that they ladde
And ever an hundred good agein on° badde.
This knoweth God and alle clerkes° eke,
That usen° sweche° materes for to seke.
What seith Valerie Titus or Claudian?
What seith Jerome agains Jovinian?
How clene° maidens, and how trewe° wives,
How stedfaste widwes duringe° alle her lives,
Telleth Jerome, and that nat of a° fewe,
But, I dar seyn, an hundred on a rewe,°
That it is pitee for to rede, and routhe,°
The wo that they endure for hir trouthe.°
For to hir love° were they so trewe,
That rather than they wolde take a newe,
They chosen to be ded in sundry° wise°
And deiden,° as the story wol devise;°
And some were brend° and some were cut the hals,°
And some dreint,° for° they wolden° not be fals.
For alle kepid° they hir° maidenhed°
Or elles° wedlok or hir widewhed
And this thing was nat kept for holinesse,°
But al for verray° vertu and clennesse,°
And for° men shulde sette° on hem° no lak;°
And yit they were hethene° al the pak,°
That were so sore° adrad° of alle shame.
These olde° wemen kepte so hir name°
That in this world I trow° men shal nat finde
A man that coude be so trewe and kinde
As was the leste° woman in that tide.°
What seith also the epistelle° of Ovide
Of trewe wives, and of hir° labour?°
What° Vincent in his Estorial Mirour?
Eek° al the world of autours maistow° here,
Cristene and hethen trete of° swich° matere;
It nedeth nat° al day thus for t’endite.
But yit I sey,° what eileth° thee to write
The draf° of stories and forget the corn°
Be° Seint Venus, of° whom that I was born,
Althow that thow reneyed° hast min lay°
As othere olde foles° manie a day,
 
Thow shalt repente it, that it shal be sene.
¶Than spak Alceste, the worthieste° quene
And seide, “God, right of your curtesie,
Ye moten° herknen° if he can replie
Agains° these pointes that ye han to him meved;°
A god ne shulde not thus been agreved,°
But of his deitee° he shal be stable,°
And therto rightful° and eek merciable.°
He shal nat rightfully his ire° wreke°
Or° he have herd the t’other partie speke.
Al ne is nat gospel° that is to yow pleined;°
The god of love hereth manie a tale yfeined.°
For in your court is manie a losenger,
And many a queint totelere accusour,
That tabouren in your eres many a thing,
For hate or for jelous imagining,
And for to han° with you sum daliaunce.°
Envie (I prey to God yeve° hir mischaunce!°)
 
Is lavender in the grete court alway;
For she ne parteth, neither night ne day,
Out of the hous of Cesar; thus seith Dante;
Whoso that goth,° alwey she mote nat wante.°
This man to° yow may wrongly ben accused
There as° be right him oghte ben excused
¶Or ells,° sir, for that° this man is nice,
He may translate a thing in° no malice,
But for he useth bokes for to make;
And taketh non hed of what matere he take;
Therefor he wrot the Rose and eek° Crisseyde
Of° innocence, and niste° what he seide;
Or him was boden make thilke tweye
Of som persone, and durste it not withseye;
For he hath writen manie a bok er° this.
He hath nat doon so grevously amis
To translaten that olde clerkes write,
As thogh that he of malice wolde endite
Despit of love, and hadde himself ywrouht.°
This shulde a rightwis lord han in his thought,
And nat be lik tiraunts of Lumbardie,
That usen° wilfulhed° and tirannie
For he that king or lord is naturel,
Him oghte nat be tiraunt and cruel,
As is a fermour, to doon the harm he can.
He moste thinke it is his lige man,
And that him oweth, of verray° duetee°
Shewin° his peple plein° benignitee°
And wel to heren° hir° excusaciouns°
And her° compleintes° and peticiouns
In duewe° time what° they shal it profre.°
This is the sentens of the Philosophre:
A king to kepe his liges in justice;
Withouten doute that is his office.
And therto is a king ful depe° ysworn,
Ful° manie an hundred wintir° herebeforn°
And for to kepe his lordes hir degree,
As it is right and skilful that they be
Enhaunsed and honoured and most dere—
For they ben halfe goddes in this world here—
This shal he doon both to pore and riche,
Al be that hir stat be nat aliche,
And han of pore folk compassioun,
For lo, the gentil kinde of the lioun!
For whan a flie offendeth him or biteth,
He with his tail awey the flye smiteth
Al esily; for, of his genterie,
Him deineth nat to wreke him on a flie,
As doth a curre or elles another beste.
In noble corage oghte ben areste,°
And weyen every thing by equitee,
And ever han reward° to his owen degree.
For, sir, it is no maistrie for a lord
To dampne a man withoute answere or word;
And, for a lord, that is ful foul to use.
And if so be he may him nat excuse,
But asketh mercy with a sorweful herte,
And profreth him, right in his bare sherte,
To been right at youre owene jugement,
Than oghte a god, by short avisement,
Considre his owne honour and his trespace.
For sith no cause of deeth lith in this cace,
Yow oght to been the lighter merciable;
Leteth youre ire, and beth somwhat tretable!
¶The man hath served yow of his conning,
And forthered your lawe with his making.
Whil he was yong, he kepte your estat;°
I not° where° he be now a renegat.°
But wel I wot with that° he can endite°
He hath maked lewed folk to delite
To serven you, in preisinge of your name.
He made the book that hight the Hous of Fame,
And eek the Deth of Blaunche the Duchesse,
And the Parlement of Foules, as I gesse,
And al the love of Palamon and Arcite
Of Thebes, thogh the story is knowe lite;
And many an impne for your halidayes,
That highten balades, roundels, and virelayes;
And, for to speke of other besinesse,°
He hath in prose translated Boece,
And Of the Wrechede Engendringe° of Mankinde
As man may in Pope Innocent yfinde
And mad the Lif also of seint Cecile;
He made also, goon is a grete while,
Origenes upon the Maudeleine;
Him oghte now to have the lesse peine;
He hath mad many a lay and many a thing.
“Now as ye been a god, and eek a king,
I, your Alceste, whilom quene of Trace,
I axe yow this man, right of your grace,
That ye him never hurte in al his live;
And he shal swere yow, and that as blive,
He shal no more agilten in this wise;
But he shal maken, as ye wil devise,
Of wemen trewe in lovinge al hir live,
Wherso ye wil, of maiden or of wive,
And forthren yow, as meche as he misseide
Or in the Rose or elles in Crisseyde.”
¶The god of love answerde hir thus anon,
“Madame,” quod he, “hit is so long agon
That I yow knew so charitable and trewe,
That never yit, sithe that the world was newe,
To me ne fond I better noon than the.
That if that I wil save mi degre,
I may ne wil nat warne your requeste;
Al lith in yow, doth with him what yow leste
And al foryeve, withoute lenger space;
For whoso yeveth a yifte or doth a grace,
Do it be time, his thank is wel the more;
And demeth ye what he shal do therfore.
¶"Go thanke now my lady heer,” quod he.
I roos, and doun I set me on my knee,
And seide thus: “Madame, the god above
Foryelde yow, that ye the god of love
Han maked me his wrathe to foryive;
And yeve me grace so longe for to live,
That I may knowe soothly what ye be
That me han holpen, and put in swich degree.
But trewely I wende, as in this cas,
Naught have agilt, ne don to love trespas.
Forwhy a trewe man, withoute drede,
Hath not to parte° with a theves dede;
Ne a trewe lover may me nat to blame,
Thogh that I speke a fals lover sum shame.
They oughte rather with me for to holde,
For that I of Criseyde wrot or tolde,
Or of the Rose; whatso min auctour mente,
Algate, God wot, it was min entente
To forthre trouthe in love and it cherice;
And to be war fro falsenesse and fro vice
By swich ensample; this was my meninge.”
¶And she answerde, “Lat be thin arguinge;
For Love ne wele nat countrepleted be
In right ne wrong; and lerne this at me!
Thou hast thy grace, and hold the right therto.
Now wole I seyn what penaunce thou shalt do
For thin trespace, and understonde it here:
Thou shalt, whil that thow livest, yer be yere,
The moste partie of thy life spende
In making of a glorious legende
Of goode women, maidenes and wives,
That were trewe in lovinge al hir lives;
And telle of false men that hem bitrayen,
That al hir lif ne doon nat but asayen
How many women they may don a shame;
For in your world that is now holden game.
And thogh thee lesteth nat° a lovere be,
Spek wel of love; this penance yive I thee.
And to the god of love I shal so preye,
That he shal charge his servauntes, by any weye,
To forthren thee, and wel thy labour quite;
Go now thy wey, this penance is but lite.”
 
¶The god of love gan smile, and than he seide,
“Wostow,” quod he, “wher this be wif or maide,
Or quene, or countesse, or of what degree,
That hath so litel penaunce yeven thee,
That hast deserved sorer for to smerte?
But pitee renneth sone in gentil herte;
That maystow seen, she kitheth what she is.”
And I answerd, “Nay, sir, so have I blis,
No more but that I see wel she is good.”
“That is a trewe tale, by min hood,”°
Quod Love, “and that thou knowest wel, pardee,
If it be so that thou avise thee.
Hastow nat in a book, lith in thy cheste,
The grete goodnesse of the quene Alceste,
That turnede was into a dayesie:
She that for hir husbande chees to deie,
And eek to gon to hell, rather than he,
And Ercules rescowed hir, pardee,
And broghte hire out of helle again to blis?”
“And I answerde agein,” and seide, “yis,
Now knowe I hir! And is this good Alceste,
The dayeseie, and min owne hertes reste?
Now fele I wel the goodnesse of this wif,
That bothe after hir deth, and in hir lif,
Hir grete bounte doubleth hir renoun!
Wel hath she quit me min affeccioun
That I have to hir flour, the dayesie!
No wonder is thogh Jove hire stellifie,
As telleth Agaton, for hir goodnesse!
Hire white coroun bereth of it witnesse;
For also manie vertues hadde she,
As smale floures in hir coroun be.
In remembraunce of hir and in honour,
Cibella made the daiesie and the flour
Ycoroned al with whit, as men may see;
And Mars yaf to hir coroun red, pardee,
In stede of rubies, set among the white.”
¶Therwith this quene wex red for shame a lite,
Whan she was preised so in hir presence.
Than seide Love, “A ful gret negligence
Was it to thee, to write onstedfastnesse°
Of women sith° thow knowest her goodnesse
By pref° and eek by stories herebiforn°
Let° be the chaf° and writ wel of the corn°
Why noldest thow han° writen of Alceste
And laten° Criseyde ben aslepe and reste?
For of Alceste shuld thy writing be
Sin that thow wist that kalendier° is she
Of goodnesse for she taught of fin lovinge
And namely of wifhood the livinge,
And alle the boundes that she oghte kepe;
Thy litel wit was thilke time aslepe.
But now I charge thee, upon thy lif,
That in thy legend thou make of this wif,
Whan thou hast other smale mad before;
And fare now wel, I charge the no more.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“At Cleopatre I wol that thou beginne;
And so forth; and my love so shalt thou winne.”
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
¶And with that word of° slep I gan awake,°
And right thus on my Legend gan I make.

¶After the deeth of Tholomee the king,
That al Egipte hadde in his governing
Regned° his quene Cleopataras;
Til on a time° befel ther swiche a cas,°
That out of Rome was sent a senatour,
For to conqueren regnes° and honour°
Unto° the toun of Rome, as was usaunce,°
To have the world unto her° obeisaunce;°
And, sooth to seyne, Antonius was his name.
So fil it,° as Fortune him oghte a schame°
Whan he was fallen in° prosperitee,
Rebel unto the toun of Rome is he.
And ovir all this the sustre of Cesare
He lafte hir falsly er° that she was ware°
And wolde algates° han another wif;
For whiche he took° with Rome and Cesar strif.°
 
¶Natheles,° forsooth,° this ilke° senatour
Was a ful worthy gentil° werreyour,°
And of° his deeth it was ful greet damage.°
But love had broght this man in° swiche a rage,°
And him so narwe° bounden in his las,°
Al for the love of Cleopataras,
That al the world he sette° at no value.
Him thought° there nas° to him no thing so due°
As Cleopatras for to love and serve;
Him roughte nat° in armes for to sterve°
In the defence of hir, and of hir right.°
 
¶This noble quene eek° lovede so this knight,
Through his desert,° and for his chivalry,
As certeinly, but if that° bokes lie,
He was, of persone° and of gentilesse,°
And of discrecioun° and hardinesse,°
Worthy to any wight° that liven may.
And she was fair as is the rose in May.
 
¶And for to make° shortly° is the beste
She wex° his wif, and hadde him as hir leste.°
The wedding and the feste to devise,°
To me, that have ytake° swiche emprise°
Of so many a storie for to make,°
Hit were to longe, lest that I shold slake°
Of thing° that bereth° more effect° and charge;°
For men may overlade° a ship or barge;
And forthy° to th’effect° than wol I skippe,
And al the remenant,° I wol lete it slippe.°
 
¶Octovian, that wood° was of° this dede,
Shoop him° an ost° on° Antony to lede
Al outerly° for his destruccioun,
With stoute° Romains, cruel as leoun;°
To ship they wente, and thus I let hem saile.
 
¶Antonius was war,° and wol nat faile
To meten° with thise Romains, if he may;
Took eek his reed,° and bothe, upon a day,°
His wif and he, and al his ost,° forth wente
To shippe anoon,° no lenger they ne stente;°
And in the see it happed° hem° to mete—
Up goth the trompe°—and for to shoute and shete,°
And peinen° hem to sette on° with° the sonne.
With grisly° soun out goth the grete gonne,°
And heterly° they hurtlen° al at ones,
And fro the top doun cometh the grete stones.°
In goth the grapenel° so ful of crokes°
Among° the ropes, rennen the shering hokes.°
In with the polax° presseth° he and he;
Behind the mast beginneth he to flee,
And out again, and driveth° him overborde;
He sticketh° him upon his speres orde;°
He rent° the sail with hokes like a sithe;°
He bringeth° the cuppe, and biddeth° hem be blithe;°
He poureth pesen° upon the hacches° slider;°
With pottes ful of lim° they goon togider;
And thus the longe day in fight they spende.
 
¶Til, at the laste, as every thing hath ende,
Antony is shent,° and put him to the flighte,
And al his folk to-go,° that best go mighte.
Fleeth° eek the queen, with al her purpre° sail,
For° strokes, which that wente as thikke as hail;
No wonder was, she mighte it nat endure.
And whan that Antony saw that aventure,°
 
¶“Allas!” quod he, “the day that I was born!
My worshipe° in this world thus have I lorn!°
And for° dispeir out of his witte he sterte,°
And roof° himself anoon throughout° the herte
Er that he ferther wente out of the place.
 
¶His wif, that coude of Cesar have no grace,°
To Egipte is fled, for drede° and for distresse;
But herkneth,° ye that speke of kindenesse°
Ye men, that falsly sweren many an ooth
That ye wol die, if that your love be wrooth,°
Heer may ye seen of women swich a° trouthe!°
This woful Cleopatre hath mad swich routhe°
That ther nis tonge noon° that may it telle.
 
¶But on the morwe° she wol no lenger dwelle,°
But made hir subtil° werkmen make a shrine
Of alle the rubies and the stones fine
In al Egipte that she coude espie;°
And putte ful° the shrine of spicerie,°
And leet° the cors° embaume;° and forth she fette°
This dede cors, and in the shrine it shette.°
And next the shrine a pit than doth she grave;°
And al the serpents that she mighte have,
She putte hem in that grave, and thus she seide:
“Now love, to whom my sorweful herte obeide
So ferforthly° that, fro that blisful houre
That I yow swore to been al frely° youre°
I mene yow, Antonius my knight!
That never waking, in the day or night,
Ye nere° out of min hertes remembraunce
For wele or wo,° for carole° or for daunce;
And in° myself this covenant° made I tho,°
That, right swich° as ye felten,° wele or wo,
As ferforth as° it in my power lay,
Unreprovable° unto my wifhood ay,°
The same wolde I felen, lif or deeth.
And thilke° covenant, whil me lasteth breeth,°
I wol fulfille, and that shal wel be sene;
Was never unto hir love a trewer quene.”
 
¶And with that word, naked,° with ful good herte,
Among the serpents in the pit she sterte,°
And ther she chees° to han° hir buryinge.
Anoon° the neddres° gonne hir for to stinge,°
And she hir deeth receiveth,° with good chere,°
For love of Antony, that was hir° so dere:—
And this is storial° sooth,° it is no fable.
Now, er° I finde a man thus trewe and stable,
And wol° for love his deeth so freely° take,°
I pray God lat° our hedes never ake!

¶At Babiloine° whilom° fil it° thus,
The whiche° toun the queen Semiramus
Leet dichen° al about,° and walles make°
Ful hie,° of harde tiles wel ybake.°
Ther weren dwellinge in this noble toun
Two lordes, which that° were of greet renoun,
And woneden° so nigh,° upon a grene,
That ther nas but° a stoon-wal hem bitwene,°
As ofte in grete tounes is the wone.°
And sooth° to seyn, that o° man hadde a sone,
Of al that londe oon of the lustieste.°
That other hadde a doghter, the faireste,
That estward in the world° was tho dwellinge.
The name of everich° gan to other springe°
By wommen, that were neighebores aboute.°
For in that contree yit, withouten doute,°
Maidens been ykept,° for° jelosie,
Ful streite,° lest they diden som folie.°
 
¶This yonge man was cleped° Piramus,
And Tisbe hight° the maid, Naso° seith thus;
And thus by report was hir name yshove°
That,° as they wexe° in age, wex hir° love;
And certein,° as by° reson of hir age,
Ther mighte have been bitwix hem° mariage
But° that hir fadres° nolde° it nat assente;°
And bothe in love ylike° sore they brente,°
That noon of al hir° frendes mighte it lette°
But prively° somtime yit they mette
By sleighte,° and spoken som of hir° desir;
As, wry the gleed,° and hotter is the fir;
Forbede° a love, and it is ten so wood.°
This wal, which that bitwix hem° bothe stood,
Was cloven° atwo, right fro the toppe adoun,
Of olde time of his fundacioun;°
But yit this clifte° was so narwe and lite,°
It nas nat° sene, dere ynogh a mite.°
 
¶But what is that, that love can nat espie?°
Ye lovers two, if that I shal nat lie,
Ye founden first this litel narwe clifte;
And, with a soun as softe as any shrifte,°
They lete° hir wordes through the clifte pace,°
And tolden,° whil that they stoden in the place,
Al hir° compleint of love, and al hir wo,
At every time whan they dorste° so.
Upon that o° side of the wal stood he,
And on that other side stood Tisbe,
The swote° soun of other° to receive,
And thus hir° wardeins° wolde they deceive.
And every day this wal they wolde threte,°
And wisshe to God, that it were doun ybete.°
 
¶Thus wold they seyn—"Allas! thou wikked wal,
Through thin envie° thou us lettest° al!°
Why nilt thou cleve,° or fallen al atwo?°
Or, at the leste,° but° thou woldest so,
Yit woldestow° but ones° lete us mete,
Or ones that we mighte kissen swete,°
Than were we covered of° our cares colde.
But natheles,° yit be we to thee holde°
In as muche as thou suffrest° to goon
Our wordes through thy lime and eek thy stoon.
Yit oghte we with thee ben wel apaid."°
And whan thise idel° wordes weren said,
The colde wal they wolden kisse of stoon,
And take hir° leve, and forth they wolden goon.°
 
¶And this was gladly in the eventide°
Or wonder° erly, lest men it espide;°
And longe time they wroghte° in this manere
Til on a day,° whan Phebus° gan to clere,°
Aurora° with the stremes° of hir hete
Had dryed up the dew of° herbes° wete;°
Unto this clifte, as it was wont° to be,
Com° Piramus, and after com Tisbe,
And plighten trouthe° fully in hir fey°
That ilke° same night to stele awey,
And to begile° hir wardeins everichoon,°
And forth out of the citee for to goon;
And, for the feldes° been so brode° and wide,
For to mete in o° place at o tide,°
They sette mark° hir meting sholde be
Ther° king Ninus was graven,° under a tree;
For olde payens° that idoles heried°
Useden° tho° in feldes to ben beried
And faste° by this grave was a welle.°
 
¶And, shortly° of this tale for to telle,
This covenant° was affermed wonder faste;°
And longe hem thoughte° that the sonne laste,
That it nere goon° under the see adoun.
This Tisbe hath so greet affeccioun
And so greet liking° Piramus to see,
That, whan she seigh her time mighte be,°
At night she stal awey ful prively°
With her face ywimpled° subtilly;°
For alle her frendes–for to save° her trouthe°–
She hath forsake; allas! and that is routhe°
That ever woman wolde be so trewe
To trusten man, but° she the bet° him knewe!
And to the tree she goth a ful good pas,°
For love made her so hardy° in this cas;°
And by the welle adoun she gan her dresse.°
 
¶Allas! than comth° a wilde leonesse
Out of the wode, withouten more areste,°
With blody mouthe, of strangling° of a beste,
To drinken of the welle, ther as° she sat;
And, whan that Tisbe had espyed° that,
She rist her up,° with a ful drery° herte,
And in a cave with dredful° foot she sterte,°
For by the mone she seigh it wel withalle.°
And, as she ran, her wimpel let she falle,
And took noon heed,° so sore° she was awhaped.°
And eek so glad of that° she was escaped;
And thus she sit, and darketh° wonder° stille.
Whan that this leonesse hath dronke her fille,
Aboute° the welle gan she for to winde,°
And right anoon° the wimpel gan she finde,°
And with her blody mouth it al torente.°
Whan this was doon, no lenger she ne stente,°
But to the wode her wey than hath she nome.°
 
¶And, at the laste, this Piramus is come,
But al to longe, allas! at hoom was he.
The mone shoon, men mighte wel ysee,°
And in his weye, as that° he com° ful faste,
His eyen to the grounde adoun° he caste,
And in the sonde,° as he beheld° adoun,
He seigh the steppes° brode° of a leoun,
And in his herte he sodeinly agroos,°
And pale he wex,° therwith his heer aroos,°
And neer he com, and fond the wimpel torn.
 
¶"Allas!" quod he, “the day that I was born!
This o° night wol us lovers bothe slee!°
How sholde I axen° mercy of Tisbe
Whan I am he that have yow slain, allas!
My bidding° hath yow slain, as in this cas.°
Allas! to bidde° a woman goon° by nighte
In place ther as° peril fallen° mighte,
And I so slow! allas, I ne hadde be°
Here in this place a furlong-wey° or° ye!
Now what° leoun that be in this foreste,
My body mote he renden,° or what beste°
That wilde is, gnawen mote he° now min herte!”
And with that worde he to the wimpel sterte,°
And kiste it ofte, and wept on it ful sore,
And seid, “Wimpel, allas! ther nis° no more°
But° thou shalt fele as wel the blood of me
As thou hast felt the bleding of Tisbe!”
And with that worde he smoot him° to° the herte.
The blood out of the wounde as brode° sterte°
As water, whan the conduit° broken is.
 
¶Now Tisbe, which that wiste° nat of this,
But sitting in her drede,° she thoghte thus,
“If it so falle° that my Piramus
Be comen hider,° and may me nat yfinde,
He may me holden° fals and eek unkinde."°
And out she comth, and after° him gan espien°
Bothe with her herte and with her yën,°
And thoghte, “I wol him tellen of my drede°
Bothe of the leonesse and al my dede."°
 
¶And at the laste° her love than hath she founde
Beting° with his heles° on the grounde,
Al blody, and therwithal° abak she sterte,°
And like the wawes° quappe gan° her herte,
And pale as box° she wex,° and in a throwe°
Avised her,° and gan him wel to knowe,°
That it was Piramus, her herte dere.°
 
¶Who coude write whiche° a deedly° chere°
Hath Tisbe now, and how her heer she rente,°
And how she gan herselve to turmente,°
And how she lith° and swowneth° on the grounde,
And how she weep° of teres ful° his wounde,
How medeleth° she his blood with° her compleinte,°
And with his blood herselven° gan she peinte;
How clippeth° she the dede cors,° allas?
How doth this woful Tisbe in this cas!°
How kisseth she his frosty mouth so cold!
“Who hath doon this, and who hath been so bold
To sleen° my leef?° O spek, my Piramus!
I am thy Tisbe, that thee calleth thus!”
 
¶And therwithal° she lifteth up his heed.
This woful man, that is nat fully deed,°
Whan that he herde the name of Tisbe cryen
On her he caste° his hevy deedly yën
And doun again, and yeldeth° up the gost.°
Tisbe rist° up, withouten noise or bost,°
And seigh her wimpel and his empty shethe,°
And eek his swerd, that him hath doon° to dethe;
 
¶Than spak she thus: “My woful° hand,” quod she,
“Is strong ynogh in swiche° a werk° to° me;
For love shal yive° me strengthe and hardinesse°
To make my wounde large ynogh, I gesse.
I wol thee folwen deed,° and I wol be
Felawe° and cause eek of thy deeth,” quod she.
“And thogh that nothing save° thy deeth only
Might thee fro me departe° trewely,
Thou shalt no more departe now fro me
Than fro the deeth, for I wol go with thee!
“And now, ye wrecched jelous fadres° oure,°
We, that weren whilom° children youre,
We prayen° yow, withouten more envie,°
That in o° grave yfere° we moten lie,
Sin° love hath brought us to this pitous° ende!
And rightwis° God to every lover sende,
That loveth trewely, more prosperitee°
Than ever had yet° Piramus and Tisbe!
And lat no gentil° woman her assure°
To putten her in swiche° an aventure.°
 
¶“But God forbede° but° a woman can
Been as trewe and loving as a man!
And, for my part, I shal anoon° it kithe!"°
And, with that worde, his swerd she took as swithe,°
That warm was of her loves blood and hoot,°
And to° the herte she herselven smoot.°
And thus ar Tisbe and Piramus ago.°
 
Of trewe men I finde but few mo°
In al my bokes, save° this Piramus,
¶And therfor have I spoken of him thus.
For it is deintee° to° us men to finde
A man that can in love be trewe and kinde.
Heer may ye seen, what lover so he be,
A woman dar° and can° as wel as he.

¶Glory and honour, Virgil Mantuan,
Be to thy name! and I shal, as I can,
Folow thy lantern, as thou gost° biforn,°
How Eneas to Dido was forsworn.°
In thin Eneïd° and Naso° wol I take
The tenour,° and the grete effectes° make.°
 
¶Whan Troye broght was to destruccioun
By Grekes sleighte,° and namely by Sinoun,
Feining° the hors y-offred unto Minerve,
Through which that many a Troyan moste° sterve;°
And Ector had, after his deeth, appered°
And fir° so wood,° it mighte nat be stered,°
In al the noble tour° of Ilioun,
That of the citee was the cheef dungeoun;°
And al the contree was so lowe ybroght,
And Priamus the king fordoon° and noght;°
And Eneas was charged° by Venus
To fleen° away, he took Ascanius,
That was his sone,° in his right hand, and fledde;
And on his bakke he bar° and with him ledde
His olde fader, cleped° Anchises,
And by the weye° his wif Creusa he lees.°
And mochel° sorwe hadde he in his minde
Er that° he coude his felawshippe° finde.
But, at the laste, whan he had hem° founde,
He made him° redy in a certein stounde,°
And to the see ful faste° he gan him hye,°
And saileth forth with al his companie
Toward Itaile, as wolde° destinee.°
 
¶But of his aventures in the see
Nis nat° to purpos° for to speke of here,
For it acordeth nat° to my matere.°
But, as I seide, of him and of Dido
Shal be my tale, til that I have do.°
So longe he sailed in the salte see
Til in Libye unnethe° arived he,
With shippes seven and with no more navie;°
And glad was he to londe for to hye,°
So° was he with the tempest al toshake.°
And whan that he the haven had ytake,°
He had a knight, was called Achates;
And him of° al his felawshippe he chees°
To goon with him, the contre for t’espie;°
He took with him no more companie.
But forth they goon, and lafte° his shippes ride,°
His fere° and he, withouten any gide.°
 
¶So longe he walketh in this wildernesse
Til, at the laste, he mette an hunteresse.
A bowe in honde and arwes° hadde she,
Her clothes cutted° were unto the knee;
But she was yit° the fairest creature
That ever was yformed by nature;
And Eneas and Achates she grette,°
And thus she to hem° spak,° whan she hem mette.
“Saw ye,”° quod she, “as ye han walked wide,°
Any of my sustren° walke yow beside,
With any wilde boor or other beste°
That they han hunted to,° in this foreste,
Ytukked up,° with arwes in her° cas?"°
“Nay, soothly,° lady,” quod this Eneas;
“But, by° thy beaute, as it thinketh me,°
Thou mightest never° erthely womman be,
But Phebus suster° artow,° as I gesse.°
And, if so be° that thou be a goddesse,
Have mercy on our labour and our wo.”
“I nam no goddes, soothly,” quod she tho;
“For maidens walken in this contree here,
With arwes° and with bowe, in this manere.
This is the regne° of Libie, ther° ye been,°
Of which that Dido lady is and queen"—
 
¶And shortly° tolde him al the occasioun°
Why Dido com° into that regioun,
Of which as now me lusteth° nat to rime;
Hit nedeth nat;° hit nere but° los of time.
For this is al and som,° it was Venus,
His owne moder, that spake° with him thus;
And to Cartage she bad he sholde him dighte,°
And vanished anoon° out of his sighte.
 
¶I coude folwe,° word for word, Virgile,
But it wolde lasten al to longe a while.°
This noble queen, that cleped° was Dido,
That whilom° was the wif of Sitheo,
That fairer was than is the brighte sonne,
This noble toun of Cartage hath begonne;°
In which she regneth in so greet honour,
That she was holde° of alle quenes flour,°
Of gentilesse,° of freedom,° of beautee;
That wel was him° that mighte her ones° see;
Of kinges and of lordes so desired,
That al the world her beaute hadde yfired;°
She stood so wel in every wightes° grace.°
 
¶Whan Eneas was come unto that place,
Unto the maister-temple° of al the toun
Ther° Dido was in her devocioun,°
Ful prively° his wey than hath he nome.°
Whan he was in the large temple come,
I can nat seyn° if that it be possible,
But Venus hadde him maked invisible—
Thus seith the book, withouten any lees.°
And whan this Eneas and Achates
Hadden in this temple been overal,°
Than founde they, depeinted° on a wal,
How Troye and al the lond° destroyed was.
 
¶"Allas! that I was born,” quod Eneas,
“Throughout the world our shame is kid° so wide,
Now it is peinted upon every side!°
We, that weren in prosperitee,°
Be now disclaundred,° and in swich° degre,°
No lenger for to liven I ne kepe!"°
And, with that worde, he brast° out for to wepe
So tendrely,° that routhe° it was to sene.
 
¶This fresshe° lady, of the citee quene,
Stood in the temple, in her estat° royal,
So richely, and eek so fair withal,°
So yong, so lusty,° with her eyen glade,°
That, if that God, that heven and erthe made,
Wolde han° a love, for beaute and goodnesse,
And womanhod,° and trouthe,° and seemlinesse,°
Whom sholde he loven but this lady swete?
There nis° no womman to him half so mete.°
 
¶Fortune, that hath the world in governaunce,°
Hath sodeinly° broght in so newe a chaunce,°
That never was ther yit° so fremd° a cas.°
For al the companie of Eneas,
Which that he wende han loren° in the see,
Arived is, nat fer° fro that citee;
For which,° the grettest of his lordes some°
By aventure ben to the citee come,
Unto that same temple, for to seke
The quene, and of her socour° her beseke;°
Swich renoun was ther spronge° of her goodnesse.
And, whan they hadden told al hir° distresse,
And al hir tempest° and hir harde cas,°
Unto the quene appered Eneas,
And openly beknew° that it was he
Who hadde joye than but° his meinee,°
That hadden founde hir° lord, hir governour?°
 
¶The quene saw they dide him swich° honour,
And had herd ofte of Eneas, er° tho,°
And in her hert she hadde routhe° and wo°
That ever swich a noble man as he
Shal been disherited° in swich degree;°
And saw the man, that he° was lik a knight,
And suffisaunt° of persone° and of might,°
And lik to been° a veray gentil° man;
And wel his wordes he besette° can,
And had a noble visage° for the nones,°
And formed wel of braunes° and of bones.
For, after° Venus, hadde he swich fairnesse,°
That no man might be half so fair, I gesse.
And wel a° lord he semed for to be.
And, for° he was a straunger, somwhat she
Liked him the bet,° as, God do bote,°
To som folk ofte newe thing is swote.°
 
¶Anoon° her herte hath pitee of his wo,
And, with that pitee, love com in also;
And thus, for pitee and for gentilesse,°
Refresshed° moste he been of his distresse.
She seide, certes,° that she sory was
That he hath had swich peril and swich cas;°
And, in her frendly speche, in this manere
She to him spak, and seide as ye may here.°
 
¶"Be ye nat Venus° sone and Anchises?
In good feith, al the worship° and encrees°
That I may goodly° doon yow, ye shul have.
Your shippes and your meinee° shal I save”;°
And many a gentil° word she spak him to;
And comaunded her messageres° go
The same day, withouten any faile,

¶She many a beste° to the shippes sente,
And with the win° she gan hem to presente;°
And to her royal paleis° she her spedde,
And Eneas alwey with her she ledde.
What nedeth° yow° the feste° to descrive?

¶Ful was the feste of deintees° and richesse,°
Of instruments, of song, and of gladnesse,°
And many an amorous loking° and devis.°
This Eneas is come to Paradis
Out of the swolw° of helle, and thus in joye
Remembreth° him of his estat° in Troye.
To dauncing-chambres ful of parements,°
Of riche beddes, and of ornaments,
This Eneas is lad, after the mete.°
And with the quene whan that he had sete,°
And spices parted,° and the win agoon,°
Unto his chambres° was he lad anoon
To take his ese and for to have his reste,
With al his folk, to doon what so° hem leste.°
Ther ne was° coursere° wel ybridled noon,
Ne stede, for the justing wel to goon,°
Ne large palfrey,° esy for the nones,°
Ne juwel,° fretted° ful of riche stones,
Ne sakkes ful of gold, of large wighte,°
Ne ruby noon, that shinede° by nighte,
Ne gentil hautein faucon heronere,°
Ne hound, for hert° or wilde boor or dere,°
Ne coupe° of gold, with florins° newe ybete,°
That in the lond of Libie may be gete,°
That Dido ne hath° it Eneas° ysent;°
And al is payed,° what that° he hath spent.
 
¶Thus can this noble quene her gestes° calle,°
As she that° can in freedom° passen° alle.
Eneas sothly eek, withouten lees,°
Hath sent unto his shippe, by Achates,
After his sone,° and after riche thinges,
Both ceptre,° clothes, broches,° and eek ringes,
Som for to were,° and som for to present°
To her, that all thise noble thinges him sente;
And bad° his sone, how that he sholde make
The presenting,° and to the quene it take.
 
¶Repaired° is this Achates again,
And Eneas ful blisful is and fain°
To seen his yonge sone Ascanius.
But natheles,° our autour° telleth us,
That Cupido, that is the god of love,
At preyere° of his moder, hye above,
Hadde the liknes° of the child ytake,°
This noble quene enamoured° to make
On° Eneas; but, as of that scripture,°
Be as be may,° I take of it no cure.°
But sooth is this, the quene hath mad° swich chere°
Unto° this child, that wonder is to here;°
And of° the present that his fader sente
She thanked him ful ofte,° in good entente.°
 
¶Thus is this quene in plesaunce° and in joye,
With al this newe lusty° folk of Troye.
And of° the dedes hath she more enquered°
Of Eneas, and al the story lered°
Of Troye; and al the longe day they tweye°
Entendeden° to speken and to pleye;
Of° which ther gan to breden° swich a fir
That sely° Dido hath now swich° desir
With Eneas, her newe gest,° to dele,°
That she hath lost her hewe,° and eek her hele.°
 
¶Now to th’effect,° now to the fruit° of al,
Why I have told this story, and tellen shal.°
 
¶Thus I beginne; it fil,° upon a° night,
When that the mone upreised° had her light,
This noble quene unto her reste wente;
She siketh° sore,° and gan herself turmente.
She waketh,° walweth,° maketh many a braid,°
As doon thise loveres, as I have herd said.
And at the laste, unto her suster Anne
She made her moon,° and right thus° spak she thanne.
“Now, leve suster min, what may it be°
That me agasteth° in my dreme?" quod she.
“This ilke° Troyan is so in my thoght,
For that° me thinketh° he is so wel ywroght,°
And eek so likly° for to be° a man,
And therwithal° so mikel° good he can,°
That al my love and lif lith in his cure.°
Have ye not herd him telle his aventure?°
Now certes,° Anne, if that ye rede it° me,
I wolde fain° to him ywedded be;
This is th’effect;° what sholde I more seye?
In him lith° al, to do° me live or deye."°
 
¶Her suster Anne, as she that° coude her good,°
Seide as her thoughte,° and somdel° it withstood.°
But herof° was so long a sermoning,°
It were to long to make rehersing;°
 
¶But finally, it may not been withstonde;°
Love wol° love—for no wight wol it wonde.°
The dawening° uprist° out of the see;
This amorous quene chargeth° her meinee°
The nettes dresse,° and speres brode° and kene;°
An hunting° wol this lusty° fresshe° quene;
So priketh° her this newe joly wo.
To hors° is al her lusty° folk ygo;°
Unto the court° the houndes been ybroght,
And up on coursers,° swift as any thoght,
Her yonge knightes hoven° al aboute,°
And of her wommen eek an huge route.°
Upon a thikke° palfrey,° paper-whit,
With sadel rede,° enbrouded° with delit,°
Of gold the barres° up enbossed° hie,
Sit° Dido, al in gold and perre° wrie;°
And she as fair, as is the brighte morwe,
That heleth seke° folk of nightes sorwe.
Upon a courser,° starting° sharp° as fir,
Men mighte turne him with a litel wir,°
 
¶Sit Eneas, lik Phebus to devise;°
So was he fresshe araied° in his wise.°
The fomy° bridel with the bit of gold
Governeth° he, right° as himself hath wold.°
 
¶And forth this noble quene thus lat I ride°
On hunting,° with this Troyan by her side.
The herd of hertes° founden° is anoon,°
With “Hey! go bet!° prik thou!° lat goon,° lat goon!
Why nil° the leoun comen or the bere,
That I mighte ones° mete him with this spere?”
Thus seyn thise yonge folk, and up they kille
These bestes° wilde, and han hem at hir wille.°
Among° al this to romblen° gan the heven,
The thunder rored with a grisly° steven;°
Doun cam° the rain, with hail and sleet so faste,
With hevenes fir,° that it so sore° agaste°
This noble quene, and also her meinee,°
That ech of hem was glad awey to flee.
 
¶And shortly,° fro the tempest her to save,
She fledde herself into a litel cave,
And with her wente this Eneas also;
I noot,° with hem if ther wente any mo;°
The auctour° maketh of it no mencioun.
And heer began the depe affeccioun
Betwix° hem° two; this was the firste morwe°
Of her gladnesse, and ginning° of her sorwe.
For ther hath Eneas ykneled° so,
And told her al his herte, and al his wo,
And sworn so depe,° to her to be trewe,
For wele or wo,° and chaunge° for no newe,°
And as a fals lover so wel can pleine,°
That sely Dido rewed° on his peine,°
And took him for husband, to been his wif
For evermo,° whil that hem laste lif.°
 
¶And after this, whan that the tempest stente,°
With mirth out as they comen,° hoom° they wente.
The wikked fame up roos,° and that anon,°
How Eneas hath with the quene ygon
Into the cave; and demed° as hem liste;°
And whan the king, that Yarbas hight,° it wiste,°
As he that had her loved ever° his lif,
And wowed° her, to° have her to his wif,
Swich° sorwe as he hath maked,° and swich chere,°
It is a routhe° and pitee for to here.°
 
¶But, as in love, alday° it happeth° so,
That oon° shal laughen at anothers wo;
Now laugheth Eneas, and is in joye
And more richess° than ever he was in Troye.
 
¶O sely° womman, ful of innocence,
Ful of pitee,° of trouthe,° and conscience,°
What maked yow to° men to trusten so?
Have ye swich° routhe° upon hir feined° wo,
And han swich olde ensamples yow beforn?°
See ye nat alle, how they been forsworn?°
Wher see ye oon, that he ne laft his leef,°
Or been unkinde,° or doon her som mischeef,°
Or pilled° her, or bosted of his dede?
Ye may as wel it seen,° as ye may rede;°
Tak heed° now of° this grete gentilman,
This Troyan, that so wel her plesen can,
That feineth him° so trewe and obeising,°
So gentil° and so privy° of his doing,
And can so wel doon alle his obeisaunces,°
And waiten° her at festes° and at daunces,
And when she goth to temple and hoom agein,
And fasten° til he hath his lady seyn,
And bere° in his devises,° for her sake,
Noot I nat° what; and songes wolde he make,
Justen,° and doon of armes° many thinges,
Sende her lettres, tokens,° broches,° ringes—
 
¶Now herkneth,° how he shal his lady serve!°
Thereas° he was in peril for to sterve°
For° hunger, and for mischeef° in the see,
And desolat,° and fled from his contree,
And al his folk with tempest al todriven,°
She hath her body and eek her reame° yiven°
Into his hond, theras° she mighte have been
Of other° land than of Cartage a queen,
And lived in joye ynogh;° what wold ye more?°
 
¶This Eneas, that hath so depe° yswore,°
Is wery° of his craft° within a throwe;°
The hote° ernest° is al overblowe.°
And prively° he doth his shippes dighte,°
And shapeth him° to stele awey by nighte.
 
¶This Dido hath suspecioun of° this,
And thoughte wel, that it was al amis;
For in his bedde he lyith° anight° and siketh;°
She asketh him anoon,° what him misliketh°—
“My dere herte,° which that° I love most?”
“Certes,”° quod he, “this night my fadres gost°
Hath in my sleep so sore° me tormented,
And eek° Mercurie his message hath presented,
That nedes° to the conquest of Itaile
My destinee° is sone for to saile;
For which, me thinketh,° brosten° is min herte!”
Therwith his false teres out they sterte;°
And taketh her within° his armes two.
 
¶"Is that in ernest,”° quod she; “wil ye so?
Have ye nat sworn to wive me to take,°
Alas! what° womman wil ye of me make?
I am a gentilwoman and a queen,
Ye wil nat fro your wif thus foule° fleen?
That I was born! allas! what shal I do?”
To telle in short,° this noble queen Dido
She seketh halwes,° and doth sacrifise;
She kneleth, crieth, that routhe° is to devise;°
Conjureth° him, and profreth° him to be
His thral,° his servant in the lest° degree;
She falleth him to fote,° and swowneth° there
Dischevelé,° with her bright gilte° here,°
And seith, “Have mercy! let me with yow ride!
Thise lordes, which that° wonen° me beside
Wil me destroyen only for your sake.
And, so° ye wil me now to wive° take,
As ye han sworn, than wol I yive yow leve°
To sleen me with your swerd now sone° at eve!°
For than yit° shal I dyen as your wif.
I am with childe, and yive° my child his lif.
Mercy, lord! have pite in your thoght!”
 
¶But al this thing availeth° her right noght;
For on a night,° slepinge, he let her lie,
And stal° awey unto his companie,
And, as a traitour, forth he gan to saile
Toward the large contree of Itaile.°
 
¶Thus hath he laft° Dido in wo and pine;°
And wedded ther a lady hight° Lavine.
A cloth he lafte, and eek his swerd stonding,°
Whan he fro° Dido stal° in her sleping,
Right at her beddes heed,° so gan he hie°
Whan that he stal awey to his navie;°
Which cloth, whan sely° Dido gan awake,
She hath it kist ful ofte° for his sake;
And seide, “O cloth, whil Jupiter it leste,°
Tak now my soule, unbind° me of° this unreste!
I have fulfild° of Fortune al the cours."°
And thus, allas! withouten his socours,°
Twenty time yswowned° hath she thanne.
And, whan that she unto her suster Anne
Compleined had, of which I may nat° write—
So greet a routhe° I have it for t’endite°—
And bad her norice° and her suster goon
To fecchen° fir and other thing anoon,
And seide, that she wolde sacrifie.°
And, whan she mighte her time° wel espie,°
Upon the fir of sacrifis she sterte,°
And with his swerd she roof her° to the herte.
 
¶But, as min auctour° seith, right thus° she seide;
When she was hurt, before er that° she deide,
She wroot a lettre anoon,° that thus began:—
“Right so,”° quod she, “as that the white swan
Ayeins° his deeth beginneth for to singe,
Right° so to yow make I my compleininge.°
Nat that I trow° to geten yow again,°
For wel I woot° that it is al in vain,
Sin° that the goddes been contraire° to me.
But sin my name° is lost through yow,” quod she,
“I may wel lese° a word on yow, or letter,
Albeit that° I shal be never the better;
For thilke° wind that blew your ship awey,
The same wind hath blowe° awey your fey."°—
 
¶But who wol° al this letter have in minde,
Rede° Ovide, and in him he shal it finde.

¶ Thou rote° of false lovers, Duk° Jasoun!
Thou sly devourer and confusioun°
Of gentil° wommen, tender creatures,
Thou madest thy reclaiming° and thy lures
To ladies of thy statly° apparaunce,
And of thy wordes, farced° with plesaunce,
And of thy feined° trouthe° and thy manere,
With thin obeisaunce° and thy humble chere,°
And with thy counterfeted peine° and wo.
Ther° other falsen° oon, thou falsest two!
 
¶O! ofte swore thou that thou woldest° die
For love, whan thou ne feltest° maledie°
Save foul° delit, which that thou callest love!
If that I live, thy name shal be shove°
In English, that thy sleighte° shal be knowe!
Have at thee, Jasoun! now thin horn is blowe!°
 
¶But certes, it is bothe routhe° and wo°
That love with false loveres werketh° so;
For they shul have wel better° love and chere
Than he that hath aboght° his love ful dere,°
Or had in armes° many a blody box.°
For ever as° tendre a capoun° et° the fox,
Thogh he be fals and hath the foul° betrayed,
As shal the goodman that therfor hath paied.
Al° have he to the capoun skille° and right,
The false fox wol have his part at night.
On° Jasoun this ensample is wel ysene°
By Isiphile and Medea the quene.
 
¶In Tessalie, as Guido telleth us,
Ther was a king that highte° Pelleus,
That had a brother, which that highte° Eson.
And, whan for° age he mighte unnethes° gon,°
He yaf° to Pelleus the governing
Of al his regne,° and made him lord and king.
Of which Eson this Jasoun geten° was,
That, in his time, in al that lond, ther nas°
Nat swich° a famous knight of gentilesse,°
Of freedom,° and of strengthe and lustinesse.°
After his fader° deeth, he bar° him so
That ther nas° noon that liste been° his fo,
But dide him° al honour and companie;°
Of which this Pelleus hath greet envie,
Imagining that Jasoun mighte be
Enhaunsed° so, and put in swich degree
With love of lordes of his regioun,
That from his regne he may be put adoun.°
 
¶And in his wit, anight,° compassed° he
How Jasoun mighte best destroyed be
Withoute slaunder° of his compassement.°
And at the laste he took avisement°
To senden him into som fer° contree;
Ther as° this Jasoun may destroyed be.
This was his wit;° al° made he to Jasoun
Gret chere° of love and of affeccioun,
For drede° lest his lordes it espide.°
 
¶So fil it° so, as fame renneth wide,°
Ther was swich tiding° overal° and swich los,°
That in an ile that called was Colcos,
Beyonde Troye, estward in the see,°
That therin was a ram, that men may see,
That had a flees° of gold, that shoon so brighte,
That nowher was ther swich° another sighte;
But it was kept° alway with° a dragoun,
And many othere merveils,° up and doun,°
And with° two boles,° maked al of bras,
That spitten fir, and moche thing° ther was.
 
¶But this was eek the tale, nathelees,°
That whoso° wolde winne thilke° flees,
He moste° bothe, or° he it winne mighte,
With the boles° and the dragoun fighte;
And king Oëtes lord was of that ile.
This Pelleus bethoughte upon° this wile;°
That he his nevew Jasoun wolde enhorte°
To sailen to that lond, him to disporte,°
And seide, “Nevew, if it mighte be
That swich a worship° mighte fallen° thee,
That thou this famous tresor mightest winne,
And bringen it my regioun° withinne,
Hit were to me gret plesaunce° and honour;
Than were I hold° to quite° thy labour.
And al the cost I wol myselven make;°
And chees° what folk that thou wilt with thee take;
Lat see now, darstow° taken this viage?"°
 
¶Jasoun was yong, and lusty° of corage,°
And undertook to doon this ilke° emprise.°
Anoon° Argus his shippes gan devise;°
With Jasoun wente the stronge Ercules,°
And many another that he with him chees.°
But whoso° axeth° who is with him gon,
Lat him go reden° Argonauticon,
For he wol telle a tale long ynow.°
 
¶Philotetes anoon the sail updrow,°
Whan that the wind was good, and gan him hie°
Out of his contree called Tessalie.°
So long he sailed in the salte see
Til in the ile° Lemnoun arived he-
Al be this° nat rehersed° of° Guido,
Yet seith Ovide in his Epistles so-
 
¶And of this ile lady was and quene
The faire yonge Isiphilee, the shene,°
That whilom° Thoas doghter was, the king.
Isiphilee was goon° in her playing;°
And, roming on the clives° by the see,
Under a banke° anoon° espyed° she
Wher that the ship of Jasoun gan arive.°
Of° her goodnesse adoun she sendeth blive°
To witen° yif that any straunge° wight°
With tempest thider were yblowe° anight,°
To doon him socour;° as was her usaunce°
To forthren° every wight, and doon plesaunce°
Of° veray° bountee° and of curtesie.
 
¶This messagere adoun him gan to hie,°
And fond Jasoun, and Ercules also,
That in a cog° to londe were ygo°
Hem° to refresshen and to take the eir.°
The morwening° atempre° was and fair;
And in his wey° the messagere hem mette.
Ful cunningly° thise lordes two he grette,°
And dide° his message, axing hem anoon°
Yif they were broken,° or oght° wo begoon,°
Or hadde nede of lodesmen° or vitaile;°
For of socour° they shulde nothing faile,°
For it was utterly the quenes wille.
 
¶Jasoun answerde, mekely and stille,°
“My lady,” quod he, “thanke I hertely°
Of° hir goodnesse; us nedeth,° trewely,
Nothing as now,° but° that we wery be,
And come for to pleye,° out of the see,
Til that the wind be better° in our weye."°
 
¶This lady rometh° by the clif to pleye,
With her meinee,° endlong° uppon the stronde,°
And fint° this Jasoun and this other stonde,°
In spekinge of° this thing, as I yow tolde.
This Ercules and Jasoun gan beholde
How that the quene it was, and faire° her grette
Anonright° as they with this lady mette,
 
¶And she took heed,° and knew, by hir° manere,
By hir aray,° by wordes and by chere,°
That it were° gentilmen, of greet degree.°
And to the castel with her ledeth° she
Thise straunge° folk, and doth hem greet honour,
And axeth hem of° travail° and labour
That they han suffred in the salte see;
So that, within a day, or two, or three,
She knew, by° folk that in his shippes be,
That it was Jasoun, ful of renomee°
And Ercules, that had the grete los,°
That soghten° the aventures of Colcos;
And dide hem honour° more then before,
And with hem deled° ever lenger the more,°
For they ben worthy folk, withouten lees.°
And namly,° most she spak° with Ercules;
To him her herte bar,° he sholde be
Sad,° wis, and trewe, of wordes avisee,°
Withouten any other affeccioun°
Of love, or evil imaginacioun.°
 
¶This Ercules hath so this Jasoun preised,
That to the sonne he hath him up areised,°
That half so trewe a man ther nas° of love
Under the cope° of heven that is above;
And he was wis, hardy,° secree,° and riche.
Of thise three pointes ther nas noon him liche:°
Of freedom° passed° he, and lustihede,°
Alle tho° that liven or been dede;
Therto° so greet a gentilman° was he,
And of Tessalie likly king to be.
Ther nas° no lak, but° that he was agast°
To love, and for to speke shamefast.°
He had lever° himself to mordre, and die
Than that men shulde a lover him espie:°
“As wolde° almighty God that I had yive°
My blood and flesh, so that° I mighte live,
With the nones° that he hadde owher° a wif
For his estat;° for swich a lusty° lif
She sholde lede with this lusty knight!”
 
¶And al this was compassed° on° the night
Betwixe him Jasoun and this Ercules.
Of° thise two heer was mad a shrewed° lees°
To come to house upon° an innocent;
For to bedote° this queen was hir° entent.
And Jasoun is as coy as is a maide,
He loketh pitously,° but noght° he saide,
But frely° yaf° he to her conseileres°
Yiftes° grete, and to her officeres.
As wolde God° I leiser° hadde, and time,
By proces° al his wowing for to rime.
But in this hous if a fals lover be,
Right as° himself now doth, right so° dide he,
With feining and with every sotil° dede.
Ye gete no more of me, but° ye wil rede
Th’original, that telleth al the cas.°
 
¶The somme° is this, that Jasoun wedded was
Unto this quene, and took of her substaunce°
Whatso° him liste,° unto his purveiaunce;°
And upon her begat° he children two,
And drow° his sail, and saw her nevermo.
 
¶A lettre sente she to him certein,°
Which were to long to writen and to seyn,°
And him repreveth° of° his grete untrouthe,°
And preyeth° him on her to have som routhe.°
And of his children two, she seide him° this,
That they be like,° of alle thing,° ywis,°
To Jasoun, save° they coude nat begile;°
And preyed° God, or° it were longe while,
That she,° that had his herte yraft° her fro,°
Most° finden him to her untrewe also,
And that she moste° bothe her children spille,°
And alle tho that suffreth° him his wille.
And trew to Jasoun was she al her lif,
And ever kepte her chast, as for° his wif;
Ne never had she joye at her herte,
But dyed, for his love, of sorwes smerte.°

¶To Colcos comen is this Duk° Jasoun,
That is of love devourer and dragoun.
As° matere appetiteth° forme alwey,
And from forme into forme it passen° may,
Or as a welle that were° botomlees,
Right so° can false Jasoun have no pees.
For, to desiren, through his appetit,°
To doon with gentil wommen his delit°
This is his lust° and his felicitee.°
 
¶Jasoun is romed° forth to the citee,
That whilom° cleped° was Jaconitos,
That was the maister-toun° of al Colcos,
And hath ytold° the cause of° his coming
Unto Oëtes, of that contre king,
Preying° him that he most doon his assay°
To gete the flees of gold, if that he may;
Of which the king assenteth to his bone,°
And doth him honour, as it is to done,°
So ferforth,° that his doghter and his eir,°
Medea, which that° was so wis and fair
That fairer saw ther never man with yë,
He made her doon to° Jasoun companye
At mete,° and sitte by him in the halle.
 
¶Now was Jasoun a semely° man withalle,°
And lik° a lord, and had a greet renoun,°
And of his loke° as real° as a leoun,
And goodly° of his speche, and famulere,°
And coude° of love al craft and art plenere°
Withoute boke, with everich observaunce.°
And, as° Fortune her oghte° a foul meschaunce,°
She wex enamoured upon° this man.
 
¶"Jasoun,” quod she, “for ought° I see or can,°
As of° this thing the which° ye been aboute,°
Ye han yourself yput in moche doute.°
For, whoso° wol this aventure acheve,
He may nat wel asterten,° as I leve,°
Withouten deeth,° but° I his helpe be.
But natheles,° it is my will,” quod she,
“To forthren° yow, so that ye shal nat die,
But turnen,° sound,° hoom to your Tessalie.”
 
¶“My righte° lady,” quod this Jasoun tho,
“That ye han° of my dethe or of my wo
Any reward,° and doon° me this honour,
I wot wel that my might° ne° my labour
May nat deserve it in my lives day;°
God thanke yow, ther° I ne can° ne may.
Your man am I, and lowly° you beseche,
To been° my help, withoute more speche;
But certes,° for° my deeth shal I nat spare.”°
 
¶Tho° gan this Medea to him declare
The peril of this cas,° fro point to point,
And of his batail,° and in what disjoint°
He mote° stande,° of which no creature,
Save° only she, ne mighte° his lif assure.°
And shortly, to the point right° for to go,
They been accorded° ful,° betwix hem two,
That Jasoun shal her wedde, as trewe knight;
And term° yset° to come sone at night
Unto her chambre, and make ther his ooth,°
Upon the goddes, that he, for leef ne looth,°
Ne sholde° her never falsen,° night ne day,
To been her husbond, whil he liven may,
As she that° from his deeth him saved here.
And herupon,° at night they mette yfere,°
And doth° his ooth, and goth with her to bedde.
And on the morwe,° upward he him spedde;°
For she hath taught him how he shal nat faile
The flees to winne, and stinten° his bataile;
And saved° him his lif and his honour;
And gete° a name right° as a conquerour
Right through the sleight° of her enchantement.
 
¶Now hath Jasoun the flees, and hoom is went°
With Medea, and tresor ful gret woon.°
But unwist of° her fader is she goon
To Tessaly, with Duk Jasoun her leef,°
That afterward hath broght her to mescheef.°
For as a traitour he is from her go,°
And with her lafte° his yonge children two,
And falsly hath betrayed her, allas!
And ever in love a cheef° traitour he was;
And wedded yit the thridde wif° anon,
That was the doghter of the king Creon.
This is the meed° of loving and guerdon°
That Medea received of Jasoun
Right° for her trouthe and for her kindenesse,
That° loved him better than herself, I gesse,
And lafte° her fader and her heritage.°
And of Jasoun this is the vassalage,°
That, in his dayes, nas ther° noon yfounde°
So fals a lover going on the grounde.°
 
¶And therfor in her lettre thus she seide
First, whan she of his falsnesse him umbreide,°
“Why liked me° thy yelow heer to see
More then the boundes° of min honestee,°
Why liked me thy youthe and thy fairnesse,°
And of thy tonge° the infinit graciousnesse?°
O, haddest thou° in thy conquest deed ybe,°
Ful mikel° untrouthe° had° ther died with thee!’’
Wel can Ovide her lettre in vers endite,°
Which were as now° to long for me to write.

¶Now moot I seyn° the exiling of kinges
Of Rome, for hir° horrible doinges,°
And of the laste king Tarquinius,
As saith Ovide and Titus Livius.
 
¶But for that cause° telle I nat this storie,
But for to preise and drawen to memorie°
The verray wif, the verray trew° Lucresse,
That, for her wifhood° and her stedfastnesse,°
Nat only that thise payens° her comende,°
But he, that cleped° is in our legende°
The grete Austin,° hath greet compassioun°
Of° this Lucresse, that° starf° at Rome toun;
And in what wise,° I wol but° shortly° trete,
And of° this thing I touche° but the grete.°
 
¶Whan Ardea beseged was aboute°
With Romains, that ful sterne° were and stoute,°
Ful longe lay the sege, and litel wroghte,°
So that they were half idel, as hem thoghte;°
And in his pley° Tarquinius the yonge
Gan for to jape,° for he was light° of tonge,°
And seide, that “It was an idel° lif;
No man did ther no more° than his wif;
And lat us speke of° wives, that is best;
Praise every man his owne, as him lest,°
And with our speche lat us ese our herte.’’°
A knight, that highte° Colatine, up sterte,°
And seide thus, “Nay, for it is no nede°
To trowen on° the word, but on the dede.
 
¶“I have a wif,’’ quod he, “that, as I trowe,°
Is holden° good of al that° ever her knowe;
Go we° tonight to Rome, and we shul see.”
 
¶Tarquinius answerd, “That liketh° me.”
To Rome be they come,° and faste hem dighte°
To Colatines hous, and doun they lighte,°
Tarquinius, and eek this Colatine.
The husbond knew the estres° wel and fine,°
And prively° into the hous they goon°
Nor at the gate porter was ther noon;°
And at the chambre-dore they abide.°
This noble wif sat by her beddes side
Dischevele,° for no malice she ne thoghte;°
And softe wolle° our book seith that she wroghte°
To kepen her fro slouthe° and idelnesse;
And bad° her servants doon hir° businesse,°
And axeth hem, “What tidings° heren ye?
How seith men of° the sege, how shal it be?
God wold° the walles weren falle° adoun;
Min husbond is so longe out of this toun,
For which the dreed° doth me° so sore smerte,°
Right as° a swerd it stingeth° to min herte
Whan I think on° the sege or of that place;
God save° my lord, I preye him° for his grace":—
And therwithal ful tenderly° she weep,°
And of her werk she took no more keep,°
But mekely she leet her eyen° falle;
And thilke semblant° sat° her wel withalle.°
And eek her teres, ful of honestee,°
Embelisshed her wifly chastitee;
Her countenaunce° is to her herte digne,°
For they acordeden° in dede and signe.
 
¶ And with that word her husbond Colatin,
Or° she of him was war,° com sterting° in,
And seide, “Dreed thee° noght, for I am here!”
And she anoon° up roos,° with blisful chere,°
And kiste him, as of wives is the wone.°
 
¶Tarquinius, this proude kinges sone,
Conceived° hath her beautee and her chere,
Her yelow heer, her shap,° and her manere,
Her hew,° her wordes that she hath compleined,°
And by no crafte° her beautee nas nat feined;°
And caughte to° this lady swich desir,
That in his herte brende° as any° fir
So woodly,° that his wit° was al forgeten,
For wel,° thoghte he, she sholde° nat be geten.°
And ay° the more that he was in dispair,
The more he coveteth° and thoghte her fair.
His blinde lust° was al° his covetinge.
 
¶Amorwe,° whan the brid began to singe,
Unto the sege° he comth ful privily,°
And by himself he walketh sobrely,°
Th’image of her recording° alwey newe;°
“Thus lay her heer, and thus fresh was her hewe;
Thus sat,° thus spak, thus span;° this was her chere,°
Thus° fair she was, and this was her manere.’’
Al this conceit° his herte hath new° ytake.°
And, as the see, with tempest al toshake,°
That, after° whan the storm is al ago,°
Yet wol the water quappe° a day or two,
Right so,° thogh that° her forme wer absent,
The plesaunce° of her forme was present;
But natheles,° nat plesaunce, but delit,°
Or an unrightful° talent° with despit;°
“For, maugre her,° she shal my lemman° be
Hap° helpeth hardy° man alday,’’° quod he;
“What ende° that I make, it shal be so;’’
And girt° him with his swerde, and gan to go;
And forth he rit° til he to Rome is come,
And al aloon his wey than hath he nome°
Unto the house of Colatin ful right.°
Doun was the sonne, and day hath lost his light;
And in he com unto a privy° halke,°
And in the night ful theefly° gan he stalke,
Whan every wight° was to his reste broght,
Ne no wight had of tresoun swich a° thoght.
Were it by window or by other gin,°
With swerde ydrawe,° shortly° he cometh° in
Ther as° she lay, this noble wif Lucresse.
 
¶And, as she wook, her bed she felte presse.°
“What beste° is that,’’ quod she, “that weyeth° thus?’’
“I am the kinges sone, Tarquinius,’’
Quod he, “but and° thou crie, or noise make,
Or if thou any creature awake,
By thilke° God that formed man on live,°
This swerd throughout thin herte shal I rive.’’°
And therwithal° unto her throte he sterte,°
And set the point al° sharp upon her herte.
No word she spak, she hath no might° therto.°
 
¶What shal she sayn? her wit° is al ago.
Right° as a wolf that fint° a lomb aloon,
To whom shal she compleine, or make moon?°
What! shal she fighte with an hardy° knight?
Wel wot° men that a woman hath no might.°
What! shal she crie, or how shal she asterte°
That° hath her by the throte, with swerde at herte?
 
¶She axeth° grace,° and seith al that she can.
“Ne wolt thou nat,”° quod he, this cruel man,
“As wisly° Jupiter my soule save,°
As° I shal in the stable slee thy knave,°
And leye him in thy bed, and loude° crie,
That I thee finde in suche avouterie;°
And thus thou shalt be deed, and also lese°
Thy name, for thou shalt non other° chese.’’°
 
¶Thise Romain wives loveden° so hir name°
At thilke° time, and dredden° so the shame,
That, what for fere of slaundre° and drede of deeth,
She loste bothe atones° wit° and breeth,
And in a swough° she lay and wex° so deed,°
Men mighte smiten of° her arm or heed;
She feleth nothing, neither foul ne fair.
 
¶Tarquinius, that art a kinges eir,°
And sholdest, as by linage° and by right,°
Doon as a lord and as a verray° knight,
Why hastow doon dispit to° chivalrie?
Why hastow doon this lady vilanie?°
Allas! of thee this was a vileins° dede!
 
¶But now to purpos;° in the story I rede,
Whan he was goon, al this mischaunce is falle.°
This lady sente after her frendes alle,
Fader, moder, husbond, al yfeere°
And al dischevele,° with her heres clere,°
In habit° swich as women used tho°
Unto the burying° of her° frendes go,
She sit in halle with a sorweful sighte.°
Her frendes axen° what her ailen° mighte,
And who was deed? And she sit° ay° wepinge,
A word for shame ne may she° forth out bringe,°
Ne upon hem she dorste° nat beholde.°
 
¶But at laste of° Tarquiny she hem tolde,
This rewful° cas,° and al this thing horrible.
The wo° to tellen° it were impossible,
That she and alle her frendes made atones.°
Al° hadde folkes hertes been of stones,
Hit mighte have maked hem° upon her rewe,°
Her herte was so wifly° and so trewe.
She seid, that, for° her gilt° ne for her blame,°
Her husbond shold nat have the foule° name,
That wolde she nat suffre,° by° no wey.
And they answerden alle, upon hir° fey,°
That they foryeve° it her, for it was right;°
Hit was no gilt, it lay nat in her might;°
And seiden° her ensamples many oon.
 
¶But al for noght;° for thus she seide anoon,°
“Be as be may,”° quod she, “of forgiving,
I wol nat have no forgift° for nothing.’’
But prively° she caughte forth° a knif,
And therwithal° she rafte herself her° lif;
And as she fel adoun, she caste° her look,
And of° her clothes yit she hede took;°
For in her falling yit she hadde care°
Lest that her feet or swiche thing° lay bare;
So wel she loved clennesse° and eek trouthe.°
 
¶Of° her had al the toun of Rome routhe,°
And Brutus by her chaste blode hath swore°
That Tarquin sholde ybanisht be therfore,
And al his kin; and let the peple calle,°
And openly the tale he tolde hem alle,
And openly let carie her on a bere°
Through al the toun, that men may see and here°
The horrible deed of her oppressioun°
Ne never was ther king in Rome toun
Sin thilke° day; and she was holden° there
A seint, and ever her day yhalwed° dere°
As in hir° lawe: and thus endeth° Lucresse,
 
¶The noble wif, as Titus° bereth witnesse.
I tell it, for she was of° love so trewe,
Ne° in her will° she chaunged° for no° newe.
And in her stable herte, sad° and kinde,°
That in these women men may alday° finde;
Ther as° they caste° hir herte, ther it dwelleth.°
For wel I wot,° that Crist himselve telleth,
That in Israel, as wid° as is the lond,
That° so gret feith in al that he ne fond,°
As° in a woman; and this is no lie.
 
¶And as of° men, loketh which° tirannie
They doon alday;° assay° hem° who so° liste,°
The trewest is ful brotel° for to triste.°

¶Juge infernal, Minos, of Crete king,
Now cometh thy lot,° now comestow on the ring;°
Nat for thy sake only write I this storie,
But for to clepe° agein unto memorie
Of° Theseus the grete untrouthe° of° love,
For which the goddes of the heven above
Ben wrothe,° and wreche han take° for thy sinne.
Be reed° for shame! now I thy lif beginne.
 
¶Minos, that was the mighty king of Crete,
That° had an hundred citees stronge and grete,
To scole° hath sent his sone Androgeus,
To Athenes; of the whiche° it happed° thus,
That he was slain,° lerning philosophie,
Right in that citee, nat but° for envie.
 
¶The grete Minos, of the whiche° I speke,
His sones deeth is comen for to wreke;°
Alcathoe° he bisegeth harde and longe.
But natheles° the walles be so stronge,
And Nisus, that was king of that citee,
So chivalrous,° that litel dredeth° he;
Of Minos or his ost° took he no cure,°
Til on a day° befel° an aventure,°
That Nisus doghter stood upon the wal,
And of the sege saw the maner al.°
So happed it, that, at a scarmishing,°
She caste her herte upon° Minos the king,
For his beautee and for his chivalrie,°
So sore,° that she wende° for to die.
And, shortly° of this proces° for to pace,°
She made Minos winnen thilke° place,
So that the citee was al at his wille,°
To saven whom him list,° or elles° spille.°
But wikkedly he quitte° her kindenesse,
And let her drenche° in sorowe and distresse,
Nere° that the goddes hadde of her pite;°
But that tale were to long as now° for me.
 
¶Athenes wan° this king Minos also,
And Alcathoe and other tounes mo;°
And this th’effect,° that Minos hath so driven°
Hem° of Athenes, that they mote° him yiven°
Fro yere to yere her° owne children dere
For to be slain,° as ye shul after here.
 
¶This Minos hath a monstre,° a wikked beste,°
That was so cruel that, without areste,°
Whan that a man was broght in his presence,
He wolde him ete,° ther helpeth° no defence.
And every thridde yeer, withouten doute,°
They casten lot,° and, as it com aboute°
On riche, on pore, he moste° his sone take,°
And of his child he moste present° make
Unto Minos, to save him or to spille,°
Or lete his beste devoure him at his wille.°
 
¶And this hath Minos don, right in° despit;°
To wreke° his sone was set al his delit,°
And maken hem° of Athenes his thral°
Fro° yere to yere, whil that° he liven shal;
And hoom he saileth whan this toun is wonne.
 
¶This wikked custom is so longe yronne°
Til that° of Athenes king Egeus°
Mot° sende his owne sone, Theseus,
Sith that the lot is fallen him upon,°
To be devoured, for grace° is ther non.
And forth is lad° this woful yonge knight
Unto the court of king Minos ful right,°
And in a prison, fetered,° cast is he
Til thilke° time he sholde yfreten° be.
 
¶Wel maystow° wepe, O woful Theseus,
That art a kinges sone, and dampned° thus.
Me thinketh this,° that thou were depe° yholde°
To whom° that saved thee fro cares° colde!°
And now, if any woman helpe thee,
Wel oughtestow° her servant for to be,
And been her trewe lover yeer by yere!
 
¶But now to come agein to my matere.°
The tour,° ther as° this Theseus is throwe°
Doun in the botom derke and wonder° lowe,°
Was joining° in the walle to a foreine;°
And it was longing° to the doghtren tweine°
Of king Minos, that° in hir° chambres grete°
Dwelten above, toward° the maister-strete,°
In mochel° mirthe, in joye and in solas.°
 
¶Not I nat° how, it happed° ther, per cas,°
As Theseus compleined him° by nighte,
The kinges doghter, Adrian that highte,°
And eek° her suster Phedra, herden° al
His compleining, as they stode on the wal
And lokeden upon° the brighte mone;
Hem leste° nat to go to bedde sone.
And of° his wo they had compassioun;
A kinges sone to ben in swich° prisoun
And be devoured, thoughte hem° gret pitee.
 
¶Than Adrian spak° to her suster free,°
And seide, “Phedra, leve° suster dere,
This woful lordes sone may ye nat here,°
How pitously compleineth° he his kin,
And eek his pore estat that he is in,
And gilteless!° Now certes, it is routhe!°
And if ye wol assenten,° by my trouthe,°
He shal be holpen,° how so that we do!"°
 
¶Phedra answerde, “Ywis,° me is as wo°
For him as ever I was for any man;
And, to his help, the beste reed° I can
Is that we doon° the gailer° prively°
To come, and speke with us hastily,
And doon° this woful man with him to come.
For if he may this monstre overcome,
Than were he quit;° ther is noon other bote.°
Lat us wel taste° him at his herte-rote,°
That, if so be° that he a wepen have,
Wher that° he dar,° his lif to kepe and save,°
Fighten with this fend,° and him° defende.
For, in the prison, ther° he shal° descende,
Ye wite° wel, that the beste° is in a place
That nis nat° derk, and hath both roum° and space
To welde° an ax or swerd or staf° or knif,
So that, me thinketh,° he shold save his lif
If that he be a man, he shal° do so.
And we shul make him balles eek also
Of wexe and tow,° that, whan he gapeth faste,°
Into the bestes throte he shal hem° caste°
To slake° his hunger and encombre° his teeth;
And right anon,° whan that° Theseus seeth
The beste achoked,° he shal on him lepe
To sleen° him, or° they comen more tohepe.°
This wepen shal the gailer,° or° that tide,°
Ful privily° within the prison hide;
And, for° the hous is crinkled° to and fro,
And hath so queinte° weyes° for to go—
For it is shapen° as the° mase° is wroght°—
Therto° have I a remedie in my thoght,
That, by a clewe of twine,° as he hath goon,
The same wey he may returne anoon,°
Folwing alwey° the threed, as he hath come.
And, whan that he this beste hath overcome,
Then may he fleen° awey out of this stede,°
And eek the gailer° may he with him lede,
And him avaunce° at hoom in his contree,
Sin that° so greet a lordes sone is he.
This is my reed,° if that he dar it take.”
 
¶What sholde I lenger sermoun° of it make?
The gailer cometh, and with him Theseus.
And whan thise thinges been acorded° thus,
Adoun° sit° Theseus upon his knee:—
“The righte° lady of my lif,” quod° he,
“I, sorweful man, ydampned° to the deeth,
Fro yow, whil that me lasteth° lif or breeth,
I wol nat twinne,° after this aventure,
But in your servise thus I wol endure,
That, as a wrecche unknowe,° I wol yow serve
For evermo, til that min herte sterve.°
Forsake I wol at hoom min heritage,
And, as I seid, ben of° your court a page,°
If that ye vouchesauf° that, in this place,
Ye graunte me to han so gret a grace°
That I may han nat but° my mete° and drinke;
And for my sustenance yit° wol I swinke,°
Right° as yow list,° that Minos ne no° wight—
Sin that° he saw me never with eyen sight°—
Ne no man elles,° shal me conne° espie;°
So slily° and so wel I shal me gie,°
And me so wel disfigure° and so lowe,°
That in this world ther shal no man me knowe,
To han my lif,° and for to han presence°
Of yow, that doon to me this excellence.°
And to my fader shal I senden here
This worthy man, that is now your gailere,°
And, him to guerdon,° that° he shal wel be
Oon of the grettest men of my contree.
And yif I dorste° seyn, my lady bright,
I am a kinges sone, and eek° a knight;
As wolde God,° yif that it mighte be
Ye weren° in my contree, alle three,
And I with yow, to bere° yow companie,
Than shuld ye seen yif that I therof° lie!
And, if I profre° yow in low° manere
To ben your page° and serven yow right here,
But° I yow serve as lowly° in that place,
I prey to Mars to yive me swiche a grace°
That shames deeth° on me ther mote° falle,°
And deeth and povert° to my frendes alle;
And that my spirit by nighte mote go
After my deeth, and walke to and fro;
That I mote of° a traitour have a name,°
For which my spirit go,° to do me shame!
And yif I ever claime other degree,°
But if° ye vouchesauf° to yive° it me,
As I have seid, of shames deeth I deie!
And mercy, lady! I can nat elles° seye!”
 
¶A seemly° knight was Theseus to see,
And yong, but of a° twenty yeer and three;
But whoso° hadde yseyn° his countenaunce,°
He wolde have wept, for routhe° of his penaunce;°
For which this Adriane in this manere
Answerde to his profre° and to his chere.°
“A kinges sone, and eek° a knight,” quod she,
“To been my servant in so low degree,
God shilde° it, for the shame of women alle!
And leve° me never swich a cas° befalle!°
But send yow grace° and sleighte° of herte also,
Yow to defende and knightly° sleen° your fo,
And leve° herafter° that I may yow finde
To me and to my suster here so kinde,
That I repente nat to give yow lif!
Yit were it better that I were your wif,
Sin that° ye been as gentil° born as I,
And have a rëaume,° nat but faste by,°
Then that I suffred° giltles yow to sterve,°
Or that I let yow as a page serve;
Hit is not profit,° as to° your kinrede;°
But what is that° that man nil° do for drede?°
And to my suster, sin that° it is so
That she mot goon° with me, if that° I go,
Or elles suffre deeth as wel as I,
That ye unto your sone as trewely°
Doon her be° wedded at your hoomcoming.
This is the final ende° of al this thing;
Ye swere it heer, on al that may be sworn.”
 
¶"Ye, lady min,” quod he, “or elles torn°
Mote° I be with the Minotaur tomorwe!
And haveth herof min herte blood to borwe,°
Yif that ye wile; if I had knif or spere,
I wolde it° leten° out, and theron swere,
For than at erst° I wot° ye wil me leve.°
By Mars, that is the cheef° of my bileve,°
So that I mighte liven and nat faile

Til that° ye shuld the verray° preve° see.
For now, if that the sooth° I shal yow say,
I have yloved yow ful° many a day,
Thogh ye ne wiste it nat,° in my contree.
And aldermost° desired yow to see
Of any erthly living creature;
Upon my trouthe° I swere, and yow assure,
Thise seven yeer I have your servant be;°
Now have I yow, and also have ye me,
My dere herte, of Athenes duchesse!”
 
¶This lady smileth at his stedfastnesse,°
And at his hertly° wordes, and his chere,°
And to her suster seide in this manere,
Al softely,° “Now, suster min,” quod she,
“Now be we duchesses, bothe I and ye,
And sikered° to the regals° of Athenes,
And both herafter likly° to be quenes,
And saved fro his deeth a kinges sone,
As ever of gentil° women is the wone°
To save a gentil man, emforth° hir° might,
In honest cause, and namely° in his right.°
Me thinketh° no wight° ought herof° us blame,
Ne beren us therfor an evel name."°
 
¶And shortly° of this mater for to make,
This Theseus of her hath leve ytake,°
And every point performed was in dede°
As ye have in this covenant° herd me rede.°
His wepen, his clew,° his thing° that I have said,
Was by the gailer° in the hous ylaid°
Ther as° this Minotaur hath his dwelling,
Right faste by° the dore, at his entring.
And Theseus is lad° unto° his deeth,
And forth unto this Minotaur he geeth,°
And by° the teching of this Adriane
He overcom this beste, and was his bane;°
And out he cometh by the clewe° again
Ful prevely,° whan he this beste hath slain;°
And by the gailer geten hath° a barge,°
And of his wives tresor° gan it charge,°
And took his wif, and eek° her suster free,°
And eek the gailer, and with hem al three
Is stole° awey out of the lond by nighte,
And to the contre of Ennopie him dighte°
Ther as° he had a frend of his knowinge.°
 
¶Ther festen° they, ther dauncen they and singe;
And in his armes hath this Adriane,
That of the beste° hath kept him from his bane;°
And gat him ther a newe barge° anoon,
And of his contree-folk a ful gret woon,°
And taketh his leve, and hoomward saileth he.
And in an ile, amid° the wilde see,
Ther as° ther dwelte creature noon°
Save° wilde bestes, and that ful many oon,°
He made his ship alonde° for to sette;
And in that ile half a day he lette,°
And seid, that on the lond he moste° him reste.
His mariners han doon right as° him leste.°
 
¶And, for to tellen shortly° in this cas,°
Whan Adriane his wif aslepe was,
For that° her suster fairer was than she,
He taketh her in his° hond, and forth goth he
To shippe, and as a traitour stal his way°
Whil that° this Adriane aslepe lay,
And to his contreeward° he saileth blive°—
A twenty devil way° the wind him drive!°—
And fond° his fader drenched° in the see.
 
¶Me list no° more to speke of him, parde;°
Thise false lovers, poison be hir bane!°
But I wol turne again to Adriane
That is with slepe for werinesse atake.°
Ful sorwefully her herte may awake.
Allas! for thee my herte hath now pite!
Right in the dawening° awaketh she,
And gropeth° in the bedde, and fond right noght.°
“Allas!" quod she, “that ever I was wroght!°
I am betrayed!" and her heer torente,°
And to the stronde° barfot fast she wente,
And cried, “Theseus! min herte swete!°
Wher be ye,° that I may nat with yow mete,
And mighte thus with bestes° been yslain?"°
The holwe° rokkes answerde her again;°
No man she saw, and yit shone the mone,
And hie °upon a rokke she wente sone,°
And saw his barge° sailing in the see.
Cold wex° her herte, and right thus° seide she.
“Meker° than ye finde I the bestes wilde!”
Hadde he nat sinne, that her thus begilde?°
She cried, “O turne again, for routhe° and sinne!
Thy barge hath nat al his meiny° inne!"°
 
¶Her kerchef° on a pole up stikked° she,
Ascaunce that° he sholde° it wel ysee,
And him remembre° that she was behinde,
And turne again, and on the stronde° her finde;
But al for noght;° his wey he is ygoon.°
And doun she fil aswown° upon a stoon;
And up she rose, and kiste,° in al her care,
The steppes° of his feet, ther° he hath fare,°
And to her bed right thus° she speketh tho:°—
“Thou bed,” quod she, “that hast received two,
Thou shalt answere of° two, and nat of° oon!
Wher is thy gretter part away ygoon?
Allas! wher° shal I, wrecched wight,° become!
For, thogh so be that° ship or boot heer come,
Hoom to my contree dar I nat° for drede;°
I can myselven in this cas nat rede!"°
 
¶What shal I telle more her° compleining?
Hit is so long, it were an hevy° thing.
In her epistle Naso° telleth al;°
But shortly° to the ende I telle shal.
The goddes have her holpen,° for pitee;
And, in the signe of Taurus, men may see
The stones° of her coroun shine clere.°—
I wol no more speke of this matere;
But thus this false lover can begile°
His trewe love. The devil quite° him his while!°

¶Thou yiver° of the formes, that hast wroght°
The faire world, and bare° it in thy thoght
Eternally, or° thou thy werk began,
Why madest thou, unto the slaundre° of man,
Or—al be that° it was not thy doing,
As for° that fin° to make swiche a thing—
Why suffrest° thou that Tereus was bore,
That is in love so fals and so forswore,°
That, fro this world up to the firste hevene,°
Corrumpeth,° whan that folk his name nevene?°
 
¶And, as to° me, so grisly° was his dede,
That, whan that I his foule story rede,
Min eyen° wexen° foule and sore also;
Yit° last° the venim of so longe ago,
That it enfecteth° him that° wol beholde.
 
¶The story of Tereus, of which° I tolde.
Of Trace° was he lord, and kin to Marte,°
The cruel god that stant° with blody darte;°
And wedded had he, with a blisful° chere,°
King Pandiones faire doghter dere,
That highte° Progne, flour° of her contree,
Thogh Juno list nat° at the feste° be,°
Ne° Ymeneus,° that god of wedding is;
But at the feste redy been, ywis,°
The Furies three, with alle hir mortel° brond.°
The owle al night aboute the balkes° wond,°
That prophet is of wo and of mischaunce.°
This revel,° ful of songe and ful of daunce,
Lasteth a fourtenight,° or litel lasse.°
 
¶But, shortly of° this story for to passe,
For I am wery of° him for to telle,
Five yeer° his wif and he togeder dwelle,
Til on a day° she gan so sore° longe
To seen her suster, that she saw nat longe,°
That for desir she niste° what to seye.
But to her husband gan she for to preye,°
For Goddes love, that she moste ones° goon
Her suster for to seen, and come° anoon,°
Or elles,° but she moste to her wende,°
She preide° him, that he wolde after her sende;
And this was, day by day, al her prayere
With al humblesse° of wifhood,° word, and chere.
 
¶This Tereus let make° his shippes yare,°
And into Grece himself is forth yfare°
Unto his fader in lawe, and gan him preye°
To vouchesauf° that, for a month or tweye,°
That Philomene, his wives° suster, mighte
On Progne his wif but ones° have a sighte—
“And she shal come to yow again anoon.°
Myself with her wol bothe come and goon,°
And as min hertes lif I wol her kepe."°
 
¶This olde Pandion, this king, gan wepe°
For tendernesse of herte, for to leve°
His doghter goon,° and for to yive° her leve;
Of al this world he loved nothing so;
But at the laste leve hath she to go.
For Philomene, with salte teres° eke,°
Gan of° her fader grace° to beseke°
To seen° her suster, that she loveth so;
And him embraceth with her armes two,
And therwithal° so yong and fair was she
That, whan that° Terëus saw her beautee,
And of array° that ther was noon her liche,°
And yit of bountee° was she two so° riche,
He caste his firy° herte upon her so
That he wol have° her, how so that° it go,°
And with his wiles° kneled and so preide,°
Til at the laste Pandion thus seide:—
“Now, son,” quod he, “that art to me so dere,
I thee betake° my yonge doghter here,
That bereth° the key of° al my hertes lif.
And grete° wel my doghter and thy wif,
And yive° her leve° somtime for to pleye,°
That she may seen me ones° er° I deye.”
 
¶And soothly,° he hath mad him riche feste,°
And to° his folk, the moste° and eek the leste,°
That with him com; and yaf° him yiftes° grete,
And him conveyeth° through the maister-strete°
Of Athenes, and to the see him broghte,
And turneth hoom; no malice he ne thoghte.°
The ores pullen forth the vessel faste,
And into Trace arriveth at the laste,°
And up into a forest he her ledde,
And to a cave privily° him spedde;°
And, in this derke cave, yif her leste,°
Or leste noght,° he bad° her for to reste;
Of whiche her herte agroos,° and seide thus,
“Wher is my suster, brother Tereus?”
And therwithal° she wepte tenderly,°
And quook° for fere, pale and pitously,°
 
¶Right° as the lamb that of° the wolf is biten;
Or as the colver,° that of° the egle is smiten,°
And is out of his clawes forth escaped,
Yet it is afered° and awhaped°
Lest it be hent° eftsones,° so sat she.
But utterly° it may non other° be.
By force hath he, this traitour, doon that dede,
That he hath reft° her of her maidenhede,°
Maugree° her heed,° by strengthe and by his might.
 
¶Lo!° here a dede of men, and that a right!°
She cryeth “Suster!" with ful° loude stevene,°
And “Fader dere!" and “Help me, God in hevene!”
Al helpeth nat;° and yet this false theef°
Hath doon this lady yet a more° mischeef,
For fere lest she sholde his shame crie,°
And doon him openly° a vilanie,°
And with his swerd her tong of kerveth° he,
And in a castel made her for to be°
Ful privily° in prison evermore,
And kepte her to his usage° and his store,°
So that she mighte him° nevermore asterte.°
 
¶O sely° Philomene! wo° is thin herte;
God wreke° thee, and sende° thee thy bone!°
Now is it time I make an ende° sone.
 
¶This Tereus is to his wif ycome,°
And in his armes hath his wif ynome,°
And pitously he weep,° and shook his heed,
And swor her° that he fond her suster deed;
For which this sely° Progne hath swich° wo,
That ny° her sorweful herte brak atwo.°
 
¶And thus in teres lete I Progne dwelle,
And of° her suster forth I wol yow telle.
This woful lady lerned had in youthe
So that she werken° and enbrouden° couthe,°
And weven° in her stole° the radevore°
As it of° women hath be woned° yore.°
 
¶And, shortly° for to seyn, she hath her fille
Of mete° and drink, and clothing at her wille,°
And coude eek° rede,° and wel ynogh endite,°
But with a penne coude she nat write;
But lettres can she weven to and fro,°
So that, by that° the yeer was al ago,°
She had ywoven° in a stamin° large
How she was broght from Athenes in a barge,°
And in cave how that° she was broght;
And al the thing° that Tereus hath wroght,°
She waf° it wel, and wroot the story above,
How she was served° for her suster° love;
And to a knave° a ring she yaf° anoon,°
And prayed° him, by signes, for to goon
Unto the quene, and beren° her that clooth,
And by signes swor many an ooth,
She sholde° him yeve° what she geten° mighte.
 
¶This knave anoon unto the quene him dighte,°
And took it her,° and al the maner° tolde.
And, whan that° Progne hath this thing beholde,°
No word she spak, for sorwe° and eek° for rage;
But feined her° to goon on pilgrimage
To Bachus° temple; and, in a litel stounde,°
Her dombe° suster sitting hath she founde,
Weping in the castel her alone.°
 
¶Allas! the wo, the compleint, and the mone°
That Progne upon° her dombe suster maketh!
In armes everich° of hem° other° taketh,
And thus I lete hem° in hir sorwe dwelle.
 
¶The remenant° is no charge° for to telle,
For this is al and som,° thus was she served,°
That never harm agilte° ne° deserved
Unto° this cruel man, that she of wiste.°
Ye may be war° of men, yif that yow liste.°
 
¶For, al be that° he wol nat, for his shame,
Doon so as Tereus, to lese° his name,°
Ne serve yow as a mordrour° or a knave,°
Ful litel° while shul ye trewe° him have,
That wol I seyn, al were he° now my brother,
But° it so be° that he may have non other.

¶By preve° as wel as by auctoritee,°
That wikked fruit cometh of° a wikked tree,
That may ye finde, if that it liketh° yow.
But for this ende° I speke this as now,
To telle you of false Demophon.
In love a falser° herde I never non,°
But if° it were his fader Theseus.
“God, for his grace, fro swich oon° kepe° us!’’
Thus may thise women prayen that it here.°
Now to thʼeffect° turne I of my matere.°
 
¶Destroyed is of Troye the citee;°
This Demophon com° sailing in the see
Toward Athenes, to his paleis° large;
With him com many a ship and many a barge°
Ful of his folk,° of which ful many oon°
Is wounded sore,° and seek,° and wo begoon,°
As° they han° at the sege° longe ylain.°
Behinde him com a wind and eek° a rain
That shoof° so sore,° his sail ne mighte stonde,
Him were lever° than al the world alonde,°
So hunteth° him the tempest to and fro.
So derk it was, he coude nowher go;°
And with a wawe° brosten° was his stere.°
His ship was rent° so lowe,° in swich manere,
That carpenter ne coude° it nat amende.°
The see, by nighte, as any torche brende°
For wood,° and posseth° him now up now doun,
Til Neptune hath of° him compassioun,
And Thetis, Thorus, Triton, and they alle,°
And maden° him upon a lond° to falle,°
Wherof that° Phillis lady was and quene,
Ligurgus doghter, fairer on to sene°
Than is the flour again° the brighte sonne.
 
¶Unnethe° is Demophon to londe ywonne,°
Waik° and wery, and his folk forpined°
Of werinesse, and also enfamined;°
That to the deeth he almost was ydriven.°
His wise folk to conseil° han° him yiven°
To seken help and socour of° the queen,
And loken° what his grace° mighte been,
And maken in that lond som chevisaunce,°
To kepen him fro wo and fro mischaunce.°
For seek° was he, and almost at the deeth;°
Unnethe° mighte he speke or drawe his breeth,
And lith° in Rodopeya him to reste.°
Whan he may° walke, him thoughte° it was the beste
Unto the court to seken° for socour.°
Men knewe him wel, and diden him° honour;
For at Athenes duk° and lord was he,
As Theseus his fader hadde ybe,°
That in his time was of greet renoun,
No man so greet in al his regioun;
And lik his fader of° face and stature,
And fals of love; it com him° of° nature;
As doth the fox Renard, the foxes sone,
Of kinde° he coude° his olde faders wone°
Withoute lore,° as can a drake° swimme,
Whan it is caught and caried to the brimme.°
 
¶This honourable Phillis doth him chere,°
Her liketh° wel his port° and his manere.
But for° I am agroted° heerbiforn°
To write of° hem° that been in love forsworn,°
And eek° to haste° me in my legende,°
Which to performe God me grace sende,°
Therfor I passe° shortly° in this wise;°
Ye han wel herd of Theseus° devise°
In the betraising° of fair Adriane,
That of her° pite kepte him from his bane.°
 
¶At shorte wordes,° right° so Demophon
The same wey, the same path hath gon°
That dide his false fader Theseus.
For unto Phillis hath he sworen thus,
To wedden her, and her his trouthe plighte,°
And piked of° her al the good he mighte,
Whan he was hool° and sound° and hadde his reste;
And doth with Phillis what so° that him leste.°
 
¶And wel coude I, yif that me leste° so,
Tellen al his doing to and fro.
He seide, unto his contree moste° he saile,
For ther he wolde her° wedding apparaile°
As fil to° her honour and his also.
 
¶And openly he took his leve tho,°
And hath her sworn, he wolde nat sojorne,°
But in a month he wolde again retorne.
And in that lond let make° his ordinaunce°
As verray° lord, and took° the obeisaunce°
Wel and hombly,° and let his shippes dighte,°
And hoom he goth° the nexte wey° he mighte;
But unto Phillis yit ne com° he noght.
And that hath she so harde° and sore° aboght,°
 
¶Allas! that, as the stories us recorde,°
She was° her owne deeth right with a corde,°
Whan that° she saw that Demophon her trayed.°
But to him first she wroot and faste° him prayed°
He wolde come, and her deliver° of° peine,
As I reherse° shal a word or tweine.°
Me list° nat vouchesauf° on° him to swinke,°
Ne spende° on him a penne ful of inke,
For fals in love was he, right° as his sire;°
The devil sette hir soules bothe afire!°
 
¶But of° the lettre of Phillis wol I write
A word or tweine,° althogh it be but lite.°
“Thin hostesse,” quod she, “O thou Demophon,
Thy Phillis, which that° is so wo begon,°
Of Rodopeye, upon° yow moot° compleine,
Over the terme° set betwix° us tweine,°
That ye ne holden forward,° as ye seide;
Your anker,° which ye in our haven leide,°
Highte° us, that ye wold comen, out of doute,°
Or that° the mone ones° wente aboute.
But times four° the mone hath hid her face
Sin° thilke° day ye wente fro this place,
And foure times light° the world again.
But for al that, yif I shal soothly° sain,°
Yit° hath the streem of Sitho nat ybroght°
From Athenes the ship; yit comth it° noght.°
And, yif that ye the terme° rekne° wolde,
As I or other trewe lovers sholde,
I pleine° not, God wot,° beforn° my day."—
 
¶But al her° lettre writen I ne may°
By ordre,° for it were to me a charge;°
Her lettre was right long and therto° large;
But here and there in rime I have it laid,°
Ther as° me thoughte° that she wel hath said.—
She seid, “Thy sailes comen nat again,
Ne° to thy word ther nis no° fey° certein;
But I wot° why ye come nat,” quod she;
“For° I was of my love to you so free.°
And of° the goddes that ye han forswore,°
Yif hir° vengeance falle on yow therfore,
Ye be nat suffisaunt° to bere the peine.
To moche trusted I, wel may I pleine,°
Upon your linage° and your faire tonge,°
And on your teres falsly out ywronge.°
How coud ye wepe so by craft?"° quod she;
“May ther swiche° teres feined° be?
Now certes,° yif ye wolde have in memorie,°
Hit oghte be to yow but° litel glorie
To have a sely° maide thus betrayed!
To God,” quod she, “preye I, and ofte have prayed,
That it be now the grettest pris° of alle,
And moste honour that ever yow shal befalle!
And whan thin olde auncestres peinted be,°
In which men may hir worthinesse see,
Than, preye I God,° thou peinted be also,
That° folk may reden,° forby° as they go,
‘Lo! this is he, that with his flaterie
Betrayed hath and doon her vilanie°
That° was his trewe love in thoghte and dede!”
But sothly,° of oo° point yit may they rede,°
That ye ben lik your fader as in° this;
For he begiled° Adriane, ywis,°
With swiche° an art and swiche sotelte°
As thou thyselven° hast begiled° me.
As in that point,° althogh it be nat fair,°
Thou folwest him, certein, and art his eir.°
But sin° thus sinfully ye me begile,
My body mote ye seen,° within a while,
Right in the haven° of Athenes fletinge,°
Withouten sepulture° and buryinge;
Thogh ye ben harder then is any stoon.”
 
¶And, whan this lettre was forth sent anoon,°
And knew° how brotel° and how fals he was,
She for dispeir fordide° herself, allas!
Swich sorwe° hath she, for she besette her° so.
 
¶Be war, ye women, of your sotil° fo,
Sin yit° this day men may ensample° see;
And trusteth, as in° love, no man but me.

¶In Grece whilom° weren° brethren two,
Of which that oon° was called Danäo,
That many a sone hath of° his body wonne,°
As swiche° false lovers ofte conne.°
Among his sones alle° ther was oon
That aldermost° he lovede of everichoon.°
And whan this child was born, this Danäo
Shoop him° a name, and called him Lino.
That other brother called was Egiste,
That was of love as fals as ever him liste,°
And many a doghter gat° he in his live;
Of which he gat upon° his righte° wive
A doghter dere,° and dide her for to calle°
Ypermistra, yongest of hem alle;
The whiche° child, of° her nativitee,°
To° alle gode thewes° born was she,
As liked to° the goddes, or° she was born,
That of the shefe she shal be the corn;
The Wirdes,° that we clepen° Destinee,
Hath shapen° her that she mot nedes° be
Pitouse,° sadde,° wise, and trewe as steel;
And to° this woman it accordeth weel.°
For, though that° Venus yaf° her greet beautee,
With Jupiter compouned° so was she
That conscience,° trouthe,° and dreed° of shame,
And of° her wifhood° for to kepe her name,°
This, thoughte her,° was felicitee° as here.
And rede° Mars was, that time of the yere,
So feble, that his malice is him raft,°
Repressed° hath Venus his cruel craft;
What with Venus and other oppressioun°
Of houses,° Mars his° venim is adoun,°
That° Ypermistra dar° nat handle a knif
In malice, thogh° she sholde lese° her lif.
 
¶But natheles,° as heven gan tho turne,°
To° badde aspectes hath she° of° Saturne,
That made her for to deien in prisoun,
As I shal after° make mencioun.
To Danäo and Egistes also—
Althogh so be that° they were brethren° two,
For thilke° time nas spared° no linage°—
Hit liked° hem° to maken mariage
Betwix Ypermistra and him Lino,°
And casten° swiche° a day it shal be so;
And ful° acorded° was it utterly;°
Th’array° is wroght,° the time is faste° by.
 
¶And thus Lino hath of° his fadres brother°
The doghter wedded, and eche of hem hath Other.
The torches brennen° and the lampes brighte,
The sacrifices been ful redy° dighte;°
Thʼencens° out of the fire reketh° sote,°
The flour, the leef is rent° up by the rote°
To maken garlands and corounes° hie;
Ful is the place of soun of minstralcie,°
Of° songes amorous of mariage,
As thilke° time was the plein° usage.°
And this was in the paleis° of Egiste,
That in his hous was lord, right as° him liste;°
And thus the day they driven° to an ende;
The frendes taken leve, and hoom they wende.°
 
¶The night is come, the brid° shal go to bedde;
Egiste to his chambre faste° him spedde,°
And privily° he let his doghter calle.°
Whan that° the hous was voided° of hem° alle,
He loked on his doghter with glad° chere,°
And to her spak,° as ye shul after here.°
“My righte° doghter, tresor° of min herte!
Sin° first that day° that shapen° was my sherte,
Or by° the fatal sustren° had° my dom,°
So ny° min herte never thing ne com°
As thou, min Ypermistra, doghter dere!
Tak heed° what I thy fader sey thee° here,
And werk after° thy wiser° evermo.°
For alderfirst,° doghter, I love thee so
That al the world to me nis° half so leef;°
Ne I nold° rede° thee to thin mischeef°
For al the gode° under the colde mone;
And what I mene, it shal be seid right° sone,
With protestacioun,° as in this wise,°
That, but° thou do as I shal thee devise,°
Thou shalt be deed, by him that al hath wroght!°
At shorte° wordes, thou nʼescapest noght°
Out of my paleis,° or that° thou be deed,
But° thou consente and werke after my reed;°
Tak this to thee for ful conclusioun."°
 
¶This Ypermistra caste her eyen° doun,
And quook° as dooth the leef of aspe° grene;
Deed° wex° her hewe,° and lik as ash to sene,
And seide, “Lord and fader, al your wille,
After my might,° God wot,° I shal fulfille,
So° it to me be no confusioun."°
 
¶"I nil,”° quod he, “have noon excepcioun";°
And out he caughte° a knif, as rasour° kene;°
“Hid° this,” quod he, “that° it be nat ysene;°
And, whan thin husbond is to bedde ygo,°
Whil that° he slepeth, cut his throte atwo.°
For in my dremes it is warned° me
How that my nevew° shal my bane° be,
But whiche° I noot,° wherfor° I wol° be siker.°
Yif thou sey nay, we two shul have a biker°
As I have seid, by him that° I have sworn.”
 
¶This Ypermistra hath ny° her wit° forlorn;°
And, for to passen harmles of° that place,
She graunted° him; ther was non other grace.°
And therwithal° a costrel° taketh he,
And seide, “Herof° a draught,° or two or three,
Yif° him to drinke, whan he goth to reste,
And he shal slepe as longe as ever thee leste,°
The narcotiks and opies° been so stronge:
And” go thy wey,” lest that him thinke longe."°
Out comth the brid,° and with ful sober° chere,°
As is of maidens ofte the manere,
To chambre is broght with revel° and with songe,
And shortly, lest this tale be to longe,
This Lino and she ben sone broght to bedde;
And every wight° out at the dore him spedde.°
 
¶The night is wasted,° and he fel aslepe;
Ful tenderly beginneth she to wepe.
She rist her up,° and dredfully° she quaketh,°
As doth the braunche that Zephirus° shaketh,
And husht were alle in Argon that citee.
As cold as any frost now wexeth° she;
For pite by the herte her streineth° so,
And dreed° of death doth her so moche wo,°
That thries° doun she fil in swiche° a were.°
She rist her up,° and stakereth° heer and there,
And on her handes faste° loketh she.
 
¶"Allas! and shul my handes blody be?
I am a maid, and, as by° my nature,
And by my semblant° and by my vesture,°
Min handes been nat shapen° for a knif,
As for to° reve° no man fro° his lif.
What devil° have I with the knif to do?
And shal I have my throte corve° atwo?°
Than shal I blede, allas! and me beshende;°
And nedes-cost° this thing mot° have an ende;
Or° he or I mot nedes° lese° our lif.
Now certes,”° quod she, “sin° I am his wif,
And hath° my feith,° yit° is it bet° for me
For to be deed° in wifly honestee°

Be as be may,° for ernest or for game,°

And weep° ful° tenderly upon his face,
And in her armes gan him to embrace,°
And him she roggeth° and awaketh softe;°
And at the window leep° he fro the lofte°
Whan she hath warned him, and doon him bote.°
 
¶This Lino swifte was, and light° of fote,
And from his wif he ran a ful good pas.°
This sely° woman is so waik,° allas!
And helples so, that, or that° she fer° wente,
Her cruel fader dide her for to hente.°
 
¶Allas! Lino! why art thou so unkinde?°
Why ne haddest thou remembred in thy minde

¶For, whan she saw that goon° awey was he,
And that she mighte nat so faste go,
Ne folwen° him, she sette her doun right tho,
Til she was caught and fetered° in prisoun.
This tale is seid for this conclusioun.°…
