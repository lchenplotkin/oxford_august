⇓The double sorwe° of Troilus to tellen,
That was the king Priamus sone of Troye,
In lovinge, how his aventures fellen
Fro wo to wele, and after out of joye,
My purpos is, er that I part fro ye.
Thesiphone, thou help me for t’endite°
Thise woful vers,° that wepen as I write!
 
To thee clepe° I, thou goddesse of torment,
Thou cruel Furie, sorwing° ever in peine;
Help me, that am the sorwful instrument
That helpeth lovers, as I can, to pleine!°
For wel sit it,° the sothe° for to seyne,
A woful wight° to han° a drery fere,°
And, to a sorwful tale, a sory chere.°
 
For I, that god of Loves servaunts serve,
Ne dar to Love, for min unliklinesse,°
Preyen for speed,° al sholde° I therfor sterve,°
So fer am I fro his help in derknesse;
But nathelees, if this may doon° gladnesse
To any lover, and his cause availe,°
⇑Have he my thank, and min be this travaile!°
 
But ye loveres, that bathen° in gladnesse,
If any drope of pitee in yow be,
Remembreth yow on passed° hevinesse
That ye han felt, and on the adversitee
Of othere folk, and thenketh how that ye
Han felt that Love dorste° yow displese;
Or° ye han wonne him with to greet an ese.
 
⇓And preyeth for hem that ben in the cas°
Of Troilus, as ye may after here,
That love hem bringe in heven to solas,
And eek° for me preyeth to God so dere,
That I have might to shewe,° in som manere,
Swich peine and wo as Loves folk endure,
In Troilus unsely° aventure.
 
And biddeth° eek for hem that been despeired°
In love, that never nil° recovered be,
And eek for hem that falsly been apeired°
Thorugh wikked tonges, be it he or she;
Thus biddeth God, for his benignitee,
To graunte° hem sone out of this world to pace,
That been despeired° out of Loves grace.
 
And biddeth eek for hem that been at ese,
That God hem graunte ay good perseveraunce,°
And sende hem might hir ladies so to plese,
That it to Love be worship° and plesaunce.
For so hope I my soule best avaunce,
To prey for hem that Loves servaunts be,
And write hir wo, and live in charitee.
 
And for to have of hem compassioun
As though I were hir owne brother dere.
Now herkneth° with a good entencioun,°
For now wol I gon streight to my matere,
In which ye may the double sorwes here
Of Troilus, in loving of Criseyde,
⇑And how that she forsook° him er she deide.°
 
It is wel wist,° how that the Grekes stronge
In armes with a thousand shippes wente
To Troyewardes, and the citee longe
Assegeden° neigh ten yeer er they stente,°
And, in diverse wise and oon entente,
The ravisshing° to wreken° of Eleine,
By Paris doon, they wroughten al hir peine.°
 
Now fil it so,° that in the toun ther was
Dwellinge a lord of greet auctoritee,
A gret devin° that cleped° was Calkas,
That in science° so expert was, that he
Knew wel that Troye shold destroyed be,
By answere of his god, that highte° thus,
Daun° Phebus or Apollo Delphicus.
 
So whan this Calkas knew by calculinge,°
And eek° by answere of this Appollo,
That Grekes sholden swich a peple° bringe,
Thorugh which that Troye moste° been fordo°
He caste° anoon° out of the toun to go;
For wel wiste° he, by sort,° that Troye sholde
Destroyed been, ye, wolde who-so nolde.°
 
For which, for to departen softely°
Took purpos ful in this forknowing° wise,
And to the Grekes ost° ful prively
He stal° anoon; and they, in curteis wise,
Him deden bothe worship and servise,
In trust that he hath conning° hem to rede°
In every peril which that is to drede.°
 
The noise up roos, whan it was first aspied,°
Thorugh al the toun, and openly° was spoken,
That Calkas traitor fled was, and allied
With hem of Grece; and casten° to ben wroken°
On him that falsly hadde his feith so broken;
And seiden, he and al his kin at ones
Ben worthy for to brennen,° fel° and bones.
 
Now hadde Calkas left, in this meschaunce,°
Al unwist° of this false and wikked dede,
⇓His doughter, which that was in gret penaunce,°
For of hir lif she was ful sore in drede,
As she that niste° what was best to rede;°
For bothe a widowe was she, and allone
⇑Of any freend, to whom she dorste° hir mone.°
 
Criseyde was this lady name aright
As to my dome,° in alle Troyes citee
Nas noon so fair, forpassing° every wight°
So aungellik was hir natif° beautee,
⇓That lik a thing inmortal semed she,
As doth an hevenish parfit° creature,
⇑That doun were sent in scorning° of nature.
 
This lady, which that alday herde at ere
Hir fadres shame, his falsnesse and tresoun,
Wel nigh out of hir wit for sorwe and fere,
In widewes habit large° of samit° broun,
On knees she fil biforn Ector adoun;
With pitous vois, and tendrely wepinge,
His mercy bad,° hirselven excusinge.
 
Now was this Ector pitous° of nature,
And saw that she was sorwfully bigoon,°
And that she was so fair a creature;
Of his goodnesse he gladed° hir anoon,
And seide, “Lat your fadres treson goon
Forth with mischaunce,° and ye yourself, in joye,
Dwelleth with us, whil you good list,° in Troye.
 
“And al th’onour that men may doon yow have,°
As ferforth as° your fader dwelled here,
Ye shul han, and your body shal men save,°
As fer as I may ought enquere or here.”
And she him thonked with ful humble chere,°
And ofter wolde, and° it had ben his wille,
And took hir leve, and hoom,° and held hir stille.°
 
And in hir hous she abood° with swich meinee°
As to hir honour nede was to holde;
And whil° she was dwellinge in that citee,
Kepte hir estat,° and bothe of yonge and olde
Ful wel beloved, and wel men of hir tolde.°
But whether that she children hadde or noon,
I rede it nought; therfore I lete it goon.
 
The thinges fellen,° as they doon of werre,°
Bitwixen° hem of Troye and Grekes ofte;
For som day boughten they of Troye it derre,°
And eft° the Grekes founden no thing softe
The folk of Troye; and thus fortune onlofte,°
And under eft,° gan hem to wheelen bothe
After hir cours, ay whil that they were wrothe.°
 
⇓But how this toun com to destruccioun
Ne falleth nought to purpos° me to telle;
For it were here a long disgressioun
Fro my matere, and yow to long to dwelle.°
But the Troyane gestes,° as they felle,
In Omer, or in Dares, or in Dite,
⇑Whoso that can, may rede hem as they write.
 
But though that Grekes hem of Troye shetten,°
And hir citee bisegede al aboute,
Hir olde usage° wolde they not letten,°
As for to honoure hir goddes ful devoute;°
But aldermost in honour, out of doute,
They hadde a relik° hight° Palladion,
That was hir trist° aboven everichon.
 
And so bifel, whan comen was the time
Of Aperil, whan clothed is the mede°
With newe grene, of lusty Ver the prime,°
And swote° smellen floures white and rede,
In sondry wises shewed, as I rede,°
The folk of Troye hir observaunces olde,
Palladions feste for to holde.
 
And to the temple, in al hir beste wise,
In general, ther wente many a wight,°
To herknen° of Palladion the servise;
And namely,° so many a lusty° knight,
So many a lady fresh and maiden bright,
Ful wel arayed,° bothe moste and leste,
Ye, bothe for the seson and the feste.
 
Among thise othere folk was Criseyda,
In widewes habite blak; but nathelees,
Right as our firste lettre is now an A,
In beautee first so stood she, makelees;°
Hir godly looking° gladede al the prees.°
Nas never seyn thing to ben preised derre,°
Nor under cloude blak so bright a sterre
 
As was Criseyde, as folk seide everichoon
That hir bihelden in hir blake wede;°
And yet she stood ful lowe and stille° alloon,
Bihinden othere folk, in litel brede,°
And neigh the dore, ay° under shames drede,°
Simple of atir,° and debonaire of chere,°
With ful assured° loking and manere.
 
This Troilus, as he was wont° to gide
His yonge knightes,° ladde hem up and doun
In thilke° large temple on every side,
Biholding ay° the ladies of the toun,
Now here, now there, for no devocioun
Hadde he to noon, to reven him° his reste,
But gan to preise and lakken° whom him leste.°
 
And in his walk ful fast° he gan to waiten°
If knight or squier of his companie
Gan for to sike,° or lete his eyen baiten°
On any woman that he coude aspie,
He wolde smile, and holden° it folie,
And seye him thus, “God wot,° she slepeth softe°
For love of thee, whan thou tornest ful ofte!
 
“I have herd told, pardieux,° of your livinge,
Ye lovers, and your lewede° observaunces,
And which a° labour folk han in winninge
Of love, and, in the keping, which doutaunces;°
And whan your preye is lost, wo and penaunces.°
O verrey foles! nice° and blinde be ye;
Ther nis° not oon can war by other be.”°
 
And with that word he gan cast up the browe,
Ascaunces,° “Lo! is this nought wisly spoken?”
At which the god of love gan loken rowe°
Right for despit,° and shoop° for to ben wroken;°
He kidde° anoon his bowe nas not broken;
For sodeinly he hit him at the fulle;°
And yet as proud a pekok can he pulle.°
 
O blinde world, O blinde entencioun!
How ofte falleth al th’effect contraire
Of surquidrie° and foul presumpcioun;
For caught is proud, and caught is debonaire.°
This Troilus is clomben° on the staire,
And litel weneth° that he moot° descenden.
But al day falleth thing° that foles ne wenden.
 
⇓As proude Bayard° ginneth for to skippe
Out of the wey, so priketh him his corn,°
Til he a lash have of the longe whippe,
Than thenketh he, “Though I praunce al biforn
First in the trais,° ful fat and newe shorn,°
Yet am I but an hors, and horses lawe
I moot endure, and with my feres° drawe.”°
 
So ferde it by this fers° and proude knight;
Though he a worthy kinges sone were,
And wende° no thing had had swiche° might
Ayens his wil that sholde his herte stere,°
Yet with a look his herte wex afere,°
That he, that now was most in pride above,
Wex° sodeinly most subget unto love.
 
Forthy ensample taketh of this man,
Ye wise, proude, and worthy folkes alle,
To scornen Love, which that so sone can
The freedom of youre hertes to him thralle;°
For ever it was, and ever it shal bifalle,
That Love is he that alle thing may binde,
For may no man fordo° the lawe of kinde.°
 
That this be sooth, hath preved° and doth yet;
For this trowe° I ye knowen, alle or some,
Men reden° not that folk han gretter wit
Than they that han be most with love ynome;°
And strengest folk ben therwith overcome,
The worthiest and grettest of degree;°
This was, and is, and yet men shal it see.
 
And trewelich it sit wel° to be so,
For alderwisest° han therwith ben plesed;
And they that han ben aldermost in wo,
With love han ben conforted most and esed;
And ofte it hath the cruel herte apesed,°
And worthy folk maad worthier of name,
And causeth most to dreden vice and shame.
 
Now sith it may not goodly be withstonde,°
And is a thing so vertuous° in kinde,°
Refuseth not to Love for to be bonde,
Sin,° as himselven list,° he may yow binde.
The yerde° is bet that bowen wole and winde°
Than that that brest;° and therfor I yow rede°
To folwen him that so wel can yow lede.
 
But for to tellen forth in special
As of this kinges sone of which I tolde,
And leten° other thinges collateral,°
Of him thenke I my tale forth to holde,
Bothe of his joye, and of his cares° colde;
And al his werk, as touching this matere,
⇑For° I it gan, I wil therto refere.°
 
Within the temple he wente him forth pleyinge,°
This Troilus, of every wight° aboute,
On this lady and now on that lokinge,
Wherso she were of toune, or withoute:°
And upon cas° bifel, that thorugh a route°
His eye perced, and so depe it wente,
Til on Criseyde it smoot,° and ther it stente.°
 
⇓And sodeinly he wex° therwith astoned,°
And gan hire bet° biholde in thrifty° wise:
“O mercy, God!” thoughte he, “Wher hastow woned,°
That art so fair and goodly to devise?”°
Therwith his herte gan to sprede and rise,
And softe° sighed, lest men mighte him here,
⇑And caughte ayein° his firste pleying chere.°
 
She nas not with the leste of hir stature,
But alle hir limes° so wel answeringe
Weren to womanhod, that creature
Was neuer lasse mannish in seminge.
And eek the pure wise° of her movinge
Shewede wel, that men might in hir gesse
Honour, estat,° and wommanly noblesse.
 
To Troilus right wonder wel withalle
Gan for to like hir movinge and hir chere,°
Which somdel deinous° was, for she leet falle°
Hir look a lite aside, in swich manere,
Ascaunces,° “What! may I not stonden here?”
And after that hir loking gan she lighte,°
That never thoughte him seen so good a sighte.
 
⇓And of hir look° in him ther gan to quiken
So greet desir, and swich affeccioun,
That in his hertes botme gan to stiken
Of hir his fixe and depe impressioun:
And though he erst° had poured° up and doun,
He was tho° glad his hornes in to shrinke;
⇑Unnethes° wiste he° how to loke or winke.°
 
Lo, he that leet himselven° so konninge,°
And scorned hem that loves peines dryen,°
Was ful unwar that love hadde his dwellinge
Withinne the subtile stremes of hir yän;°
That sodeinly him thoughte he felte dyen,
Right with hir look, the spirit in his herte;
Blessed be love, that thus can folk converte!
 
She, this in blak, liking° to Troilus
Over alle thing he stood for to biholde;
Ne his desir, ne wherfor° he stood thus,
He neither chere made,° ne worde tolde;
But from afer, his maner for to holde,°
On other thing his look somtime he caste,
And ofte on hir, whil that servise laste.
 
And after this, not fulliche al awhaped,°
Out of the temple al esiliche° he wente,
Repentinge him that he hadde ever yjaped°
Of loves folk, lest fully the descente
Of scorn fille on himself; but, what he mente,
Lest it were wist° on any maner side,
His wo he gan dissimulen and hide.
 
Whan he was fro the temple thus departed,
He streight anoon° unto his paleis torneth,°
Right with hir look thurgh shoten and thurgh darted,
Al feineth he in lust° that he sojorneth;°
And al his chere and speche also he borneth;°
And ay, of loves servants every while,
Himself to wrie,° at hem he gan to smile.
 
⇓And seide, “Lord, so ye live al in lest,
Ye loveres! for the conningest° of yow,
That serveth most ententiflich° and best,
Him tit° as often harm therof as prow;°
Your hire° is quit ayein,° ye, God wot how!
Nought wel for wel, but scorn for good servise;
In feith, your ordre is ruled in good wise!
 
“In nouncertein° ben al your observaunces,
But it a sely° fewe pointes be;
Ne nothing asketh° so grete attendaunces
As doth your lay,° and that knowe alle ye;
But that is not the worste, as mote I thee;°
But, tolde I yow the worste point, I leve,°
Al seide° I sooth,° ye wolden at me greve!°
 
“But tak this, that° ye loveres ofte eschuwe,°
Or elles doon of good entencioun,
Ful oft thy lady wole it misconstrue,
And deme° it harm in hir opinioun;
And yet if she, for other enchesoun,°
Be wrooth,° than shalt thou han a groin° anoon:
Lord! wel is him that may be of yow oon!”
 
But for al this, whan that he say° his time,
He held his pees, non other bote° him gained;
For love bigan his fetheres so to lime,°
That wel unnethe° unto his folk he feined°
That othere besie nedes him destrained;°
For wo was him, that what to doon he niste,°
⇑But bad his folk to goon wher that hem liste.°
 
And whan that he in chaumbre was allone,
He doun upon his beddes feet him sette,
And first he gan to sike°, and eft° to grone,
And thoughte ay on hir so, withouten lette,°
That, as he sat and wook, his spirit mette°
That he hir saw atemple, and al the wise°
Right of hir loke, and gan it newe avise.°
 
Thus gan he make a mirour of his minde,
In which he saugh al hoolly hir figure;
And that he wel coude in his herte finde,
It was to him a right good aventure
To love swich oon, and if he dide his cure°
To serven hir, yet mighte he falle in grace,
Or elles,° for oon of hir servaunts pace.°
 
Imagining that travaille° nor grame°
Ne mighte, for so goodly oon, be lorn°
As she, ne him for his desir ne shame,
Al were it wist,° but in pris and upborn°
Of alle lovers wel more than biforn;
Thus argumented he in his ginninge,
Ful unavised° of his wo cominge.
 
Thus took he purpos loves craft to suwe,°
And thoughte he wolde werken prively,
First, to hiden his desir in muwe°
From every wight yborn,° al outrely,°
But° he mighte ought° recovered be therby;
Remembring him, that love to wide yblowe°
Yelt° bittre fruit, though swete seed be sowe.
 
And over al this, yet muchel more he thoughte
What for to speke, and what to holden inne,
And what to arten° hir to love he soughte,
And on a song anoonright to biginne,
And gan loude on his sorwe for to winne;°
For with good hope he gan fully assente
Criseyde for to love, and nought repente.°
 
⇓And of his song nought only the sentence,°
As writ min autour called Lollius,
But pleinly, save our tonges difference,
I dar wel sayn, in al,° that Troilus
Seide in his song; lo! every word right thus
As I shal seyn; and whoso list° it here,
Lo! next this vers, he may it finden here.

“If no love is, O God, what fele I so?
And if love is, what thing and whiche is he?
If love be good, from whennes comth my wo?
If it be wikke,° a wonder thinketh me,°
Whenne every torment and adversitee
That cometh of him, may to me savory thinke;
For ay thurst I, the more that I it drinke.
 
“And if that at min owene lust° I brenne,
Fro whennes cometh my wailing and my pleinte?°
If harme agree me, wherto° pleine I thenne?
I noot,° ne why unwery° that I feinte.°
O quike° deeth, O swete harm so queinte,°
How may° of thee in me swich quantitee,
But if° that I consente that it be?
 
“And if that I consente, I wrongfully
Compleine, ywis; thus possed° to and fro,
Al sterelees° withinne a boot° am I
Amid the see, bitwixen° windes two,
That in contrarie° stonden evermo.
Allas! what is this wonder maladie?
⇑For hete of cold, for cold of hete, I deie.”°
 
And to the god of love thus seide he
With pitous vois, “O lord, now youres is
My spirit, which that oughte youres be.
Yow thanke I, lord, that han° me brought to this;
But whether goddesse or womman, ywis,
She be, I noot,° which that ye do° me serve;
But as hir man I wole ay° live and sterve.°
 
“Ye stonden in hire eyen° mightily,°
As in a place unto your vertu° digne;°
Wherfore, lord, if my servise or I
May like yow,° so beth° to me benigne;
For min estat royal here I resigne
Into hir hond, and with ful humble chere
Bicome hir man,° as to my lady dere.”
 
In him ne deined° sparen blood royal
The fir of love, wherfro° God me blesse,°
Ne him forbar° in no degree, for al
His vertu or his excellent prowesse;
But held him as his thral° lowe in distresse,
And brende° him so in sondry wise° ay newe,
That sixty time a day he loste his hewe.°
 
So muche, day by day, his owene thought,
For lust to° hir, gan quiken and encrese,
That every other charge° he sette at nought;
Forthy ful ofte, his hote fir to cese,°
To seen hir goodly look he gan to prese;°
For therby to ben esed wel he wende,°
And ay the ner° he was, the more he brende.°
 
For ay the ner the fir, the hotter is,
This, trowe° I, knoweth al this companie.
But were he fer or neer, I dar seye this,
By night or day, for wisdom or folie,
His herte, which that is his brestes ye,°
Was ay° on hir, that fairer was to sene
Than ever was Eleine or Polixene.
 
Eek of the day ther passed nought an houre
That to himself a thousand time he seide,°
“Good goodly, to whom serve I and laboure,
As I best can, now wolde God, Criseyde,
Ye wolden on me rewe° er that I deide!°
My dere herte, allas! min hele and hewe°
And lif is lost, but ye wole on me rewe.”
 
Alle othere dredes weren from him fledde,
Bothe of the assege° and his savacioun;°
Ne in him desir noon othere fownes° bredde
But arguments to this conclusioun,
That she on him wolde han compassioun,
And he to be hir man, whil he may dure;°
Lo, here his lif, and from the deeth his cure!
 
The sharpe shoures felle of armes preve,°
That Ector or his othere bretheren diden,
Ne made him only therfore ones meve;
And yet was he, wherso men wente° or riden,
Founde oon the best, and lengest time abiden°
Ther peril was, and dide eek such travaile°
In armes, that to thenke it was mervaile.
 
But for non hate he to the Grekes hadde,
Ne also for the rescous° of the toun,
Ne made him thus in armes for to madde,°
But only, lo, for this conclusioun,
To liken° hir the bet for his renoun;
Fro day to day in armes so he spedde,°
That al the Grekes as the deeth° him dredde.
 
And fro this° forth tho refte° him love his sleep,
And made his mete° his foo;° and eek° his sorwe
Gan multiplie, that, whoso toke keep,°
It shewed in his hewe,° bothe eve and morwe;
Therfor a title° he gan him for to borwe°
Of other siknesse, lest of him men wende°
That the hote fir of love him brende.°
 
And seide, he hadde a fever and ferde amis;°
But how it was, certain, can I not seye,
If that his lady understood not this,
Or feined hir she niste,° oon of the tweie;
But wel I rede° that, by no maner weie,
Ne semed it as that she of him roughte,°
Nor of his peine, or whatsoever he thoughte.
 
But than fel to this Troilus such wo,
That he was wel neigh wood;° for ay his drede
Was this, that she som wight° had loved so,
That never of him she wolde have taken hede;
For which him thoughte he felte his herte blede.
Ne of his wo ne dorste° he not biginne
To tellen it, for al this world to winne.
 
But whanne he hadde a space fro° his care,
Thus to himself ful ofte he gan to pleine;°
He saide, “O fool, now art thou in the snare,
That whilom japedest° at loves peine;
Now artow hent,° now gnaw thin owene cheine;
Thou were ay wont° eche lovere reprehende
Of thing fro which thou canst thee nat defende.
 
“What wol now every lover seyn of thee,
If this be wist, but ever in thin absence
Laughen in scorn, and seyn, ‘Lo, ther gooth he,
That is the man of so gret sapience,°
That held us loveres leest in reverence!
Now, thonked be God, he may goon in the daunce
Of hem that Love list° febly for to avaunce!’°
 
“But, O thou woful Troilus, God wolde,°
Sin° thow most loven thurgh thy destinee,
That thow beset° were on swich oon that sholde
Knowe al thy wo, al° lakkede hir pitee:
But al so cold in love, towardes thee,
Thy lady is, as frost in winter mone,
And thou fordoon,° as snow in fir is sone.
 
“God wolde I were arived in the port
Of deeth, to which my sorwe wil me lede!
A, Lord, to me it were a greet comfort;
Then were I quit of languisshing in drede.
For be° min hidde sorwe yblowe on brede°
I shal bijaped° been a thousand time
More than that fool of whos folie men rime.
 
“But now help God, and ye, swete, for whom
I pleine, ycaught, ye, never wight° so faste!°
O mercy, dere herte, and help me from
The deeth, for I, whil that my lif may laste,
More than myself wol love yow to my laste.
And with som freendly look gladeth me, swete,
Though never more thing ye me bihete!”°
 
This wordes and ful manie another to°
He spak, and called evere in his compleinte
Hir name, for to tellen hir his wo,
Til neigh that he in salte teres dreinte.°
Al was for nought, she herde nought his pleinte;
And whan that he bithoughte on° that folie,
A thousand fold his wo gan multiplie.
 
Biwailing° in his chambre thus allone,
A freend of his, that called was Pandare,
Com ones in unwar,° and herde him grone,
And sey° his freend in swich distresse and care:
“Allas!” quod he, “who causeth al this fare?°
O mercy, God! what unhap° may this mene?
Han now thus sone Grekes maad yow lene?°
 
“Or hastow som remors° of conscience,
And art now falle in som devocioun,
And wailest° for thy sinne and thin offence,
And hast for ferde° caught attricioun?°
God save hem that biseged han our toun,

⇓These wordes seide he for the nones° alle,

“What cas,”° quod Troilus, “or what aventure
Hath gided thee to see my languisshinge,°
That am refus° of euery creature?
But for the love of God, at my preyinge,°
Go henne° away, for certes, my deyinge

“But if thou wene° I be thus sik for drede,°

But though that I now tell thee it ne leste,°
Be thou nought wrooth, I hide it for the beste.”
 
This Pandare, that neigh malt° for wo and routhe,°
Ful often seide, “Allas! what may this be?
Now freend,” quod he, “if ever love or trouthe°
Hath been, or is, bitwixen° thee and me,

“I wole parten with thee° al thy peine,

Hid not thy wo fro me, but telle it blive.”°
 
Than gan this sorwful Troilus to sike,°
And seide him thus, “God leve° it be my beste
To telle it thee; for, sith it may thee like,°
Yet wole I telle it, though min herte breste;°
And wel wot° I thou mayst do me no reste.°

“Suffiseth this, my fulle freend Pandare,

And with that Pandare of his wordes stente;

And of that word took hede° Troilus,

And with that thought he gan ful sore sike,°

To whom Pandare answerde, “If thee like,°
The best is that thou telle me thy wo;

“Ye, so thou seyst,” quod Troilus tho, “allas!

Ful hard were it to helpen in this cas,
For wel finde I that Fortune is my fo,

Quod Pandarus, “Than blamestow Fortune

And yet thou hast this comfort, lo, pardee!°
That, as hir joyes moten overgone,°
So mote hir sorwes passen everichone.
 
“For if hir wheel stinte° anything to torne,°

And with that word he gan him for to shake,
And seide, “Theef,° thou shalt hir name telle.”
But tho° gan sely° Troilus for to quake°
As though men sholde han lad him into helle,

But out of Latin in my tonge it write.
 
Wherfore I nil° have neither thank ne blame
Of al this werk, but pray° yow mekely,
Disblameth° me, if any word be lame,
For as min auctor seide, so seye I.
Eek° though I speke of love unfelingly,°
No wonder is, for it no thing of newe° is;
A blind man can nat juggen wel in hewis.°
 
Ye knowe eek,° that in forme of speche is chaunge
Withinne a thousand yeer, and wordes tho°

And spedde° as wel in love as men now do;
Eek for to winne love in sondry° ages,
In sondry londes, sondry ben usages.°
 
And forthi if it happe in any wise,
That here be any lovere in this place
That herkeneth,° as the story wol devise,°
How Troilus com to his lady grace,°
And thenketh, so nolde I nat° love purchace,
Or wondreth on his speche and his doinge,
I noot;° but it is me° no wonderinge;
 
For every wight which that to Rome went,
Halt nat o path,° or alwey o manere.
Eek in some lond were al the gamen shent,°
If that they ferde° in love as men don here,
As thus, in open doing or in chere,
In visitinge, in forme, or seide hir sawes;°
Forthi men seyn, ech contree hath his° lawes.
 
Eek scarsly been ther in this place three
That have in love seid lik° and doon in al;
For to thy purpos this may liken thee,°
And thee right nought, yet al is seid or shal;
Eek som men grave° in tree, som in stoon wal,

In May, that moder is of monthes glade,
That fresshe floures, blewe, and white, and rede,
Ben quike again, that winter dede° made,
And ful of bawme° is fletinge° every mede;°
Whan Phebus doth his brighte bemes sprede
Right in the white Bole,° it so bitidde°
As I shal singe, on Mayes day the thridde,
 
That Pandarus, for° al his wise speche,
Felte eek his part of loves shottes kene,°
That, coude he never so wel of loving preche,
It made his hewe aday ful ofte° grene;°
So shoop° it, that him fil° that day a tene°
In love, for which in wo to bedde he wente,
And made, er° it was day, ful many a wente.°
 
The swalwe° Proignè, with a sorwful lay,°
Whan morwe com, gan make hir weimentinge,°
Why she forshapen° was; and ever lay
Pandare abedde, half in a slomberinge,
Til she so neigh° him made hir chiteringe°
How Tereus gan forth hir suster take,°
That with the noise of hir he gan awake;
 
And gan to calle,° and dresse him° up to rise,
Remembringe him his erand was to done
From Troilus, and eek his greet emprise;°
And caste° and knew in good plit° was the mone
To doon viage,° and took his wey ful sone
Unto his neces paleis° ther biside.
Now Janus, god of entree, thou him gide!
 
Whan he was come unto his neces place,
“Wher is my lady?” to hir folk quod he;
And they him tolde; and he forth in gan pace,°
And fond two othere ladies sete° and she
Withinne a paved parlour;° and they three
Herden a maiden reden hem° the geste°
 
Of the Sege of Thebes, whil hem leste.
Quod Pandarus, “Ma dame, God yow see,°
With al your book and al the companie!”
“Ey, uncle min, welcome ywis,”° quod she,
And up she roos, and by the hond in hie°
She took him faste,° and seide, “This night thrie,°
To goode mote° it turne, of yow I mette!”°
And with that word she doun on bench him sette.
 
“Ye, nece, ye shal fare wel the bet,°
If God wole, al this yeer,” quod Pandarus;
“But I am sory that I have yow let°
To herknen of° your book ye preisen thus;
For Goddes love, what seith it? tel it us.
Is it of love? O, som good ye me lere!”°
“Uncle,” quod she, “your maistresse is not here!”
 
With that they gonnen° laughe, and tho° she seide,
“This romaunce is of Thebes, that we rede;
And we han herd how that king Laius deide
Thurgh° Edippus his sone, and al that dede;
And here we stenten° at these lettres rede,°
How the bisshop, as the book can telle,
Amphiorax, fil thurgh the ground to helle.”
 
Quod Pandarus, “Al this knowe I myselve,
And al th’assege° of Thebes and the care;°
For herof been ther° maked bokes twelve:—
But lat be this, and tel me how ye fare;
Do wey your barbe,° and shew your face bare;
Do wey° your book, ris up, and lat us daunce,
And lat us don° to May som observaunce.”
 
“I? God forbede!” quod she, “Be ye mad?”
Is that a widewes lif, so God you save?°
By God, ye maken me right sore adrad,
Ye ben so wilde, it semeth as ye rave!
It satte me wel bet° ay° in a cave
To bidde,° and rede on° holy seintes lives:
Lat maidens gon to daunce, and yonge wives.”
 
“As ever thrive I,” quod this Pandarus,
“Yet coude I telle a thing to doon you pleie.”°
“Now uncle dere,” quod she, “tel it us
For Goddes love; is than the assege aweye?°
I am of Grekes so fered° that I deie.”
“Nay, nay,” quod he, “as ever mote I thrive!°
It is a thing wel bet than swiche five.”°
 
“Ye, holy God!” quod she, “What thing is that?
What? bet than swiche five? Ey,° nay, ywis!°
For al this world ne can I reden° what
It sholde been; som jape,° I trowe,° is this.
And but° yourselven telle us what it is,
My wit is for to arede° it al to lene;°
As help me God, I noot° nat what ye mene.”
 
“And I your borow,° ne never shal, for me,°
This thing be told to yow, as mote I thrive!”
“And why so, uncle min? why so?” quod she.
“By God,” quod he, “that wole I telle as blive;°
For prouder womman were ther noon on live,°
And° ye it wiste,° in al the toun of Troye;
I jape° nought, as ever have I joye!”
 
Tho gan she wondren more than biforn
A thousand fold, and doun hir eyen caste;
For never, sith° the time that she was born,
To knowe thing desired she so faste;°
And with a sik° she seide him at the laste,
“Now, uncle min, I nil° yow nought displese,
Nor axen° more, that may do yow disese.”°
 
So after this, with many wordes glade,
And freendly tales, and with mery chere,
Of this and that they pleide, and gunnen wade°
In many an unkouth° glad and deep matere,
As freendes doon, whan they ben met yfere;°
Til she gan axen him how Ector ferde,
That was the tounes wal and Grekes yerde.°
 
“Ful wel, I thanke it God,” quod Pandarus,
“Save in his arm he hath a litel wounde;
And eek his fresshe° brother Troilus,
The wise worthy Ector the secounde,
In whom that every vertu list abounde,°
As alle trouthe and alle gentillesse,
Wisdom, honour, fredom,° and worthinesse.”
 
“In good feith, eem,”° quod she, “that liketh me;°
They faren wel, God save hem bothe two!°
For trewelich I holde it greet deintee°
A kinges sone in armes wel to do,
And been of good condiciouns° therto;
For greet power and moral vertu here
Is selde yseye in o persone yfere.”°
 
“In good feith, that is sooth,”° quod Pandarus;
But, by my trouthe,° the king hath sones tweie,
That is to mene, Ector and Troilus,
That certainly, though that I sholde deie,°
They been as voide of vices, dar I seye,
As any men that liveth under the sonne,
Hir might is wide yknowe,° and what they conne.°
 
Of Ector nedeth it nought° for to telle;
In al this world ther nis° a bettre knight
Than he, that is of worthinesse welle;°
And he wel° more vertu hath than might.
This knoweth many a wis and worthy wight.°
The same pris° of Troilus I seye,
God help me so, I knowe not swiche tweie.”
 
“By God,” quod she, “of Ector that is sooth;
Of Troilus the same thing trowe I;
For dredelees,° men tellen° that he dooth
In armes day by day so worthily,
And bereth him her at hoom so gentilly°
To every wight, that al the pris hath he
Of hem that me were levest° preised be.”°
 
“Ye sey right sooth, ywis,” quod Pandarus;
“For yesterday, whoso° had with him been,
He might han wondred upon Troilus;
For never yet so thikke a swarm of been°
Ne fleigh,° as Grekes for him gonne fleen;°
And thorugh the feld, in every wightes ere,°
Ther nas° no cry but ‘Troilus is there!’
 
“Now here, now ther, he hunted hem so faste,
Ther nas but° Grekes blood; and Troilus,
Now hem he hurte, and hem° al doun he caste;
Ay° where he wente it was arayed° thus:
He was hir° deeth, and sheld and lif for us;
That as° that day ther dorste noon° withstonde,
Whil that he held his blody swerd in honde.
 
Therto° he is the freendlieste man
Of grete estat,° that ever I saw my live;
And wher him list,° best felawshipe can°
To suche as him thinketh° able for to thrive.”°
And with that word tho Pandarus, as blive,
He took his leve, and seide, “I wol go henne”:°
“Nay, blame have I,° min uncle,” quod she thenne.
 
“What eileth° yow to be thus wery sone,°
And namelich° of wommen? wol ye° so?
Nay, sitteth down; by God, I have to done°
With yow, to speke of wisdom° er ye go.”
And every wight that was aboute hem tho,
That herde that, gan fer awey to stonde,
Whil they two hadde al that hem liste in honde.°
 
Whan that hir tale° al brought was to an ende
Of hir estat and of hir governaunce,
Quod Pandarus, “now is it time I wende;°
But yet, I seye, ariseth,° lat us daunce,
And cast your widwes habit to mischaunce:°
What list yow° thus yourself to disfigure,
Sith° yow is tid° thus faire an aventure?”
 
“A! wel bithought!° for love of God,” quod she,
“Shal I not witen° what ye mene of° this?”
“No, this thing axeth laiser,”° tho quod he,
“And eek me wolde muche greve,° ywis,

Yet were it bet° my tonge for to stille
Than seye a sooth° that were ayeins your wille.
 
“For, nece, by the goddesse Minerve,
And Jupiter, that maketh the thondre ringe,
And by the blisful Venus that I serve,

Withoute paramours,° to my witinge,°

“Ywis,° min uncle,” quod she, “grant mercy;
Your freendship have I founden° evere yit;

And, with the grace of God, emforth my wit,°

But, for the love of God, I yow beseche,

And with that word hir uncle anoon hir kiste,

With that she gan hir eyen° doun to caste,

And loked on hir in a besy wise,°

“Yes, yes,” quod he, “and bet wole° er° I go;

“For to every wight som goodly aventure°

And come ayein anoon and stood him by,
And seide, ‘Awake, ye slepen al to longe;
It semeth nat that love dooth yow longe,°
 
“ ‘That slepen so that no man may yow wake.
Who sey° evere or° this so dul a man?’
‘Ye, freend,’ quod he, ‘do ye your hedes ake°
For love, and lat me liven as I can.’
But though that he for wo was pale and wan,
Yet made he tho° as fresh° a contenaunce,
As though he shulde have led the newe daunce.°
 
“This passed forth,° til now, this other day,
It fel° that I com roming al allone
Into his chaumbre, and fond° how that he lay
Upon his bed; but man so sore grone°
Ne herde I never,° and what that was his mone,
Ne wiste I nought;° for, as I was cominge,
Al sodeinly he lefte his compleininge.
 
⇓“Of which I took somewhat suspecioun,°
And neer I com,° and fond he wepte sore;
And God so wis be my savacioun,
As nevere of thing° hadde I no routhe° more.
For neither with engin,° ne with no lore,°
Unethes° mighte I fro the deth him kepe;
⇑That yet fele I min herte for him wepe.
 
“And God wot,° nevere, sith° that I was born,

Ne never was to wight so depe ysworn,°
Or° he me tolde who might been his leche.°
But now to yow rehersen° al his speche,
Or alle his woful wordes for to soune,
Ne bid me not,° but ye wol° see me swowne.
 
“But for to save his lif, and elles nought,°
And to non° harm of yow, thus am I driven;
And for the love of God that us hath wrought,
Swich chere him dooth,° that he and I may liven.
Now have I plat° to yow min herte schriven;°
And sin° ye woot° that min entente is clene,

“And right good thrift,° I pray to God, have ye,

And be° ye wis, as ye ben fair to see,
Wel in the ring than is the ruby set.
Ther were never° two so wel ymet,°

“Nay, therof spak I not, a, ha!” quod she,
“As help me God, ye shenden° every deel!”°
“O mercy, dere nece,” anoon quod he,
“Whatso I spak, I mente nought but weel,°
By Mars the god, that helmed is of steel;
Now beth nought wrooth, my blood,° my nece dere.”
“Now wel,” quod she, “foryeven be it° here!”
 
With this he took his leve, and hoom he wente;
And Lord, how he was glad and wel bigoon!°
Criseyde aroos, no lenger she ne stente,°
But streght into hir closet° wente anoon,
And sette hir doun as stille as any stoon,
And every word gan up and doun to winde,°
That he had seid, as it com hir to minde;°
 
And wex° somdel astonied° in hir thought,
Right for the newe cas;° but whan that she
Was ful avised,° tho fond she right nought
Of peril, why she oughte afered° be.
For man may love, of possibilitee,°
A womman so, his herte may tobreste,°
And she nought love ayein,° but if hir leste.°
 
But as she sat allone and thoughte thus,
Th’ascry° aroos at skarmish° al withoute,
And men cride in the strete, “See, Troilus
Hath right now put to flight the Grekes route!”°
With that gan al hir meinee° for to shoute,
“A! go we see,° caste up the yates° wide;
For thurgh this strete he moot to palais ride;
 
“For other wey is fro the yate noon
Of Dardanus, ther° open is the cheine.”
With that com he and al his folk° anoon
An esy pas° ridinge, in routes° tweine,
Right as his happy° day was, sooth to seyne,°
For which, men say, may nought disturbed° be
That shal bitiden of° necessitee.
 
This Troilus sat on his baye° stede,
Al armed, save his hed, ful richely,
And wounded was his hors, and gan to blede,
On whiche he rood a pas,° ful softely;
But swich a knightly sighte, trewely,
As was on him,° was nought, withouten faile,°
To loke on Mars, that god is of bataile.
 
So lik a man of armes and a knight
He was to seen,° fulfild° of heigh prowesse;
For bothe he hadde a body and a might
To doon a thing, as wel as hardinesse;°
And eek to seen him in his gere him dresse,°
So fresh, so yong, so weldy° semed he,
It was an heven upon him for to see.°
 
His helm tohewen° was in twenty places,
That by a tissew heng, his bak bihinde,°
His sheld todasshed° was with swerdes and maces,
In which men mighte many an arwe finde
That thirled° hadde horn° and nerf° and rinde;°
And ay the peple cride, “Here cometh our joye,
And, next° his brother, holder up of Troye!”
 
For which he wex a litel reed for shame,
Whan he the peple upon him herde crien,
That to biholde it was a noble game,
How sobreliche he caste doun his yën.
Criseyda gan al his chere° aspien,°
And leet so softe° it in hir herte sinke,
That to hirself she seid, “Who yaf° me drinke?”°
 
For of hir owene thought she wex al reed,
Remembringe hir right thus, “Lo, this is he
Which that min uncle swereth he moot be deed,
But° I on him have mercy and pitee.”
And with that thought, for pure ashamed,° she
Gan in hir heed to pulle, and that as faste,
Whil he and al the peple forby paste,°
 
And gan to caste° and rollen up and doun
Withinne hir thought his excellent prowesse,
And his estat,° and also his renoun,
His wit, his shap, and eek his gentillesse;
But most hir favour° was, for° his distresse
Was al for hir, and thoughte it was a routhe°
To sleen swich oon,° if that he mente° trouthe.
 
Now mighte som envious jangle° thus,
“This was a sodein love, how mighte it be
That she so lightly° loved Troilus
Right for° the firste sighte; ye, pardee?”
Now whoso seith so, mote he never ythee!°
For every thing, a ginning hath it nede°
Er al be wrought,° withouten any drede.°
 
For I sey nought that she so sodeinly
Yaf him hir love, but that she gan encline°
To like him first, and I have told yow why;
And after that, his manhod and his pine°
Made love withinne hir for to mine,°
For which, by proces and by good servise,
He gat° hir love, and in no sodein wise.
 
And also blisful Venus, wel araied,
Sat in hir seventh hous° of hevene tho,
Disposed wel, and with aspectes paied,°
To helpen sely° Troilus of° his wo.
And, sooth to seyn, she nas nat al a fo°
To Troilus in his nativitee;
God woot that wel the soner° spedde° he.
 
Now lat us stinte of° Troilus a throwe,°
That rideth forth,° and lat us tourne faste
Unto Criseyde, that heng hir heed ful lowe,
Theras° she sat allone, and gan to caste°
Wheron she wolde apointe hir° at the laste,
If it so were hir eem° ne wolde cesse,°
⇑For Troilus, upon hir for to presse.
 
And, Lord! so she gan in hir thought argue
In this matere of which I have yow told,
And what to doon best were, and what eschue,
That plited° she ful ofte in many fold.°
Now was hir herte warm, now was it cold,
And what she thoughte somwhat shal I write,
As to° min auctor listeth for to endite.°
 
She thoughte wel, that Troilus° persone
She knew by sighte and eek his gentillesse,
And thus she seide, “Al were it nought to done,°
To graunte him love, yet, for his worthinesse,
It were honour, with pley and with gladnesse,
In honestee, with swich a lord to dele,°
For min estat,° and also for his hele.°
 
⇓“Eek, wel wot I my kinges sone is he;
And sith° he hath to see me swich delit,

Now were I° wis, me hate to purchace,°
Withouten nede,° ther I may stonde in grace?
 
“In every thing, I woot,° ther lith° mesure.
For though a man forbede° dronkenesse,
He nought forbet° that every creature
Be drinkelees for alwey, as I gesse;°
Eek sith° I woot for me is his distresse,
I ne oughte not for that thing him despise,
Yif it is so, he meneth in good wise.°
 
“And eek I knowe, of° longe time agoon,°

N’avauntour,° seith men, certein, is he noon;
To wis is he to do so gret a vice;

He shal me never binde in swiche a clause.°
 
“Now set a cas,° the hardest° is, ywis,

“Ek wot I wel he worthy is to have

For out and out he is the worthieste,
Save° only Ector, which that° is the beste.
And yet his lif al lith° now in my cure,°
But swich is love, and eek min aventure.°
 
“Ne me to love,° a wonder is it nought;
For wel wot° I myself, so God me spede,°
Al wolde I° that no man wist° of my thought,
I am oon the faireste,° out of drede,°
And goodlieste, whoso taketh hede;°
And so men seyn in al the toun of Troye.
What wonder is though he of me have joye?
 
“I am min owene woman, wel at ese,°
I thank it God, as after min estate;°
Right yong, and stonde unteid° in lusty lese,°
Withouten jalousie or swich debate;

For either they ben ful of jalousie,

“What shal I doon? to what fin° live I thus?

What, par dieux!° I am nought religious!°
And though that I min herte sette at reste
Upon this knight, that is the worthieste,
And kepe alwey min honour and my name,
By alle right,° it may do me no shame.”
 
But right as whan the sonne shineth brighte,
In March, that chaungeth ofte time his face,
And that a cloud is put with wind to flighte
Which oversprat° the sonne as for a space,
A cloudy thought gan thorugh hir soule pace,°
That overspradde hir brighte thoughtes alle,
So that for fere° almost she gan to falle.
 
⇓That thought was this, “Allas! sin° I am free,
Sholde I now love, and putte in jupartie°
My sikernesse,° and thrallen° libertee?
Allas! how dorste° I thenken that folie?
May I nought wel in other folk° aspie°
Hir dredful° joye, hir constreint,° and hir peine?
Ther loveth noon, that she nath° why° to pleine.°
 
“For love is yet the moste stormy lif,
Right of himself,° that ever was bigonne;
For evere som mistrust, or nice strif,°

“Also these wikked tonges been so prest°
To speke us harm, eek men be so untrewe,
That, right anoon° as cessed is hir lest,°
So cesseth love, and forth to love a newe:
But harm ydoon is doon, whoso it rewe.°
For though these men for love hem first torende,°
Ful sharp° biginning breketh ofte at ende.
 
“How ofte time hath it yknowen be,

⇓And after that, hir thought gan for to clere,
And seide, “He which that nothing undertaketh,
Nothing ne acheveth, be him looth or dere.”°
And with an other thought hir herte quaketh;
Than slepeth hope, and after drede awaketh;
Now hoot, now cold; but thus, bitwixen tweie,
She rist° hir up, and went hir for to pleye.°
 
Adoun the steire° anoonright° tho she wente
Into hir gardin, with hir neces three,
And up and doun ther made many a wente,°
Flexippe, she, Tharbe, and Antigone,

And othere of hir wommen, a grete route,°
Hir folwede in the gardin al aboute.
 
This yerd was large, and railed° al the aleies,°
And shadwed wel with blosmy bowes grene,
Ibenched° newe, and sonded al the weyes,°
In which she walketh arm in arm bitwene;
Til at the laste Antigone the shene°
Gan on a Trojan lay to singe clere,
That it an heven° was hir vois to here.—
 
She seide, “O love, to whom I have and shal

“As he that is the welle° of worthinesse,

“Whom sholde I thanke but yow, god of love,

This is the righte lif that I am inne,
To flemen° al manere vice and sinne:
This doth me so to vertu for to entende,°
That day by day I in my wille amende.
 
“And whoso seith that for to love is vice,

He outher° is envious, or right nice,°
Or is unmighty,° for his shrewednesse,°
To loven; for swich maner folk, I gesse,
Defamen love, as no thing of him knowe;°
They speken, but they bent never his bowe.
 
“What,° is the sonne wers,° of kinde righte,°

Al dredde I° first to love him to biginne,

And of hir song right with that word she stente,°
And therwithal, “Now, nece,” quod Criseyde,
“Who made this song now with so good entente?”°
Antigone answerde anoon, and seide,
“Ma dame, ywis, the goodlieste° maide
Of greet estat in al the toun of Troye;
And let° hir lif in most honour and joye.”
 
“Forsothe,° so it semeth by hir song,”
Quod tho Criseyde, and gan therwith to sike,°
And seide, “Lord, is there swich blisse among
These loveres, as they conne° faire endite?”°
“Ye, wis,”° quod fresh Antigone the white,°
“For alle the folk that han or been on live°

Criseyde unto that purpos° nought answerde,
But seide, “Ywis, it wol be night as faste.”°
But every word which that she of° hir herde,
She gan to prenten° in hir herte faste;°
And ay gan love hir lasse° for to agaste°
Than it dide erst, and sinken in hir herte,
That she wex somwhat able to converte.°
 
The dayes honour, and the hevenes eye,

So whan it liked° hir to goon to reste,
And voided° weren they that voiden oughte,

Hir wommen sone unto hir bed hir broughte.
Whan al was hust,° than lay she stille, and thoughte
Of al this thing the manere and the wise.
Reherce° it nedeth nought, for ye ben wise.
 
A nightingale, upon a cedre grene,
Under the chambre wal ther as° she lay,
Ful loude sang ayein° the mone shene,°
Paraunter,° in his briddes wise,° a lay
Of love, that made hire herte fresh and gay.

And dide his herte into hir brest to goon,°
Of which she nought agroos° ne nothing smerte,°
And forth he fleigh,° with herte left for herte.
 
Now lat hir slepe, and we our tales holde°
Of Troilus, that is to paleis riden,°

And in his chambre sit,° and hath abiden
Til two or three of his messages° yeden°
For Pandarus, and soughten him ful° faste,

This Pandarus com leping in at ones°

But° Troilus, that hath caught him an hete?”°
And gan to jape,° and seide, “Lord, ye swete!°
But ris, and lat us soupe° and go to reste.”
And he answerde, “Do we as thee leste.”
 
⇓With al the haste goodly° that they mighte,
They spedde hem° fro the souper unto bedde;
And every wight out at the dore him dighte°
And wher him list° upon his wey he spedde;
But Troilus, that thoughte his herte bledde
For wo, til that he herde som tidinge,
He seide, “Freend, shal I now wepe or singe?”
 
Quod Pandarus, “Ly stille, and lat me slepe,

But right° as floures, thorugh the colde of night
Yclosed, stoupen° on hir stalkes lowe,
Redressen hem° ayein° the sonne bright,
And spreden on hir kinde cours° by rowe;°
Right so gan tho his eyen up to throwe
This Troilus, and seide, “O Venus dere,
Thy might, thy grace, yheried° be it here!”
 
And to Pandare he held up bothe his hondes,
And seide, “Lord, al thin be that I have;
For I am hool,° al brosten° been my bondes;

“Al esily,° now, for the love of Marte,”°
Quod Pandarus, “For every thing hath time;

“Touching° thy lettre, thou art wis ynough,

Ne scrivenish° or craftily° thou it write;
Beblotte° it with thy teres eek a lite;°
And if thou write a goodly word al softe,°
Though it be good, reherce° it not to ofte.
 
“For though° the beste harpour upon live°

This counseil liked wel to° Troilus;
But, as a dreedful° lover, he seid this: —
“Allas, my dere brother Pandarus,
I am ashamed for to write, ywis,
Lest of min innocence I seide amis,°
Or that she nolde° it for despit receive;°
Thanne were I° deed, ther mighte it nothing weive.”°
 
To that Pandare answerde, “If thee lest,°
Do that° I seye, and lat me therwith gon;
For by that Lord that formed est and west,
I hope of it to bringe answere anon
Right of hir hond, and if that thou nilt noon,°
Lat be; and sory mote he been his live,°
Ayeins° thy lust° that° helpeth thee to thrive.”°
 
Quod Troilus, “Depardieux,° I assente;
Sin° that thee list, I will arise and write;
And blisful God preie ich, with good entente,
The viage,° and the lettre I shal endite,
So spede it;° and thou, Minerva, the white,°
Yif° thou me wit my lettre to devise”:
And sette him doun, and wroot right in this wise.° —
 
First he gan hir his right° lady calle,
His hertes lif,° his lust, his sorwes leche,°

To telle al how, it axeth° muchel space.
 
And after this, ful lowly° he hir praide°
To be nought wrooth,° though he, of° his folie,
So hardy° was to hir to write, and seide,
That love it made,° or elles moste° he die,
And pitously° gan mercy for to crie;
And after that he seide, and lei° ful loude,°
Himself was litel worth, and lesse he coude;°
 
And that she sholde han° his conning° excused,
That litel was, and eek he dredde° hir so,
And his unworthinesse he ay acused;°
And after that, than gan he telle his wo;
But that was endeles, withouten ho;°
And seide, he wolde in trouthe° alwey him holde; —
And radde° it over, and gan the lettre folde.
 
And with his salte teres gan he bathe
The ruby in his signet,° and it sette
Upon the wex deliverliche° and rathe;°
Therwith a thousand times, er he lette,°
He kiste tho the lettre that he shette,°
And seide, “Lettre, a blisful destenee
Thee shapen is,° my lady shal thee see.”
 
This Pandar took the lettre, and that bitime°
Amorwe,° and to his neces paleis sterte,°
And faste he swoor, that it was passed prime,
And gan to jape,° and seide, “Ywis, min herte,
So fresh° it is, although it sore smerte,°
I may not slepe nevere a Mayes morwe;°
I have a joly wo, a lusty° sorwe.”
 
Criseyde, whan that she hir uncle herde,
With dreedful° herte, and desirous to here
The cause of his cominge, thus answerde,
“Now by your feith,° min uncle,” quod she, “dere,
What maner windes gideth° yow now here?
Tel us your joly wo and your penaunce,°
How ferforth° be ye put° in loves daunce.”
 
“By God,” quod he, “I hoppe° alwey° bihinde!”
And she to laugh,° it thoughte° hir herte breste.°
Quod Pandarus, “Loke alwey that ye finde
Game in min hood,° but herkneth, if yow leste;°
Ther is right now come into toune a geste,°
A Greek espie,° and telleth newe thinges,
For which come I to telle yow tidinges.
 
“Into the gardin go we, and ye shal here,
Al prevely,° of this a long sermoun.”°
With that they wenten arm in arm yfere°
Into the gardin from the chaumbre doun.
And whan that he so fer° was that the soun°
Of that° he spake, no man here mighte,
⇑He seide hir thus, and out the lettre plighte,°
 
“Lo, he that is al hoolly° youres free°
Him recomaundeth lowly° to your grace,
And sente you this lettre here by me;
Aviseth you on it, whan ye han space,
And of som goodly° answer yow purchace;°
Or, help me God, so pleinly° for to seyne,
He may not longe liven for° his peine.”
 
Ful dredfully° tho gan she stonde stille,
And took it nought, but al hir humble chere
Gan for to chaunge, and seide, “Scrit ne bille,°
For love of God, that toucheth swich matere,
Ne bringeth me noon; and also, uncle dere,
To min estat° haveth more reward,° I preie,
Than to his lust;° what sholde I more seye?
 
“And loketh now if this be resonable,
And letteth° nought, for favour° ne for slouthe,
To seyn a sooth;° now were it covenable°
To min estat, by God, and by your trouthe,
To taken it, or to han of him routhe,°
In harming of myself or in repreve?°
Ber it ayein,° for him that ye on leve!”°
 
This Pandarus gan on hir for to stare,
And seide, “Now is this the grettest wonder
That ever I sei!° lat be this nice fare!°
To deethe mote° I smiten° be with thonder,
If, for the citee which that stondeth yonder,
Wolde I a lettre unto yow bringe or take
To harm of yow; what list yow° thus it make?°
 
“But thus ye faren,° wel neigh alle and some,°
That he that most desireth yow to serve,
Of him ye recche leest° wher he bicome,°
And whether that he live or elles sterve.°
But for al that that ever I may deserve,
Refuse it nought,” quod he, and hente° hir faste,°
And in hir bosom the lettre doun he thraste,°
 
⇓And seide hir, “Now cast it away anoon,
That folk may seen and gauren° on us tweie.”°
Quod she, “I can abide° til they be goon,”
And gan to smile, and seide him, “Em, I preie,
Swich answere as yow list yourself purveie,°
For trewely I nil° no lettre write.”
⇑“No? than wol I,” quod he, “so ye endite.”°
 
Therwith she lough, and seide, “Go we° dine.”
And he gan at himself to jape faste,°
And seide, “Nece, I have so greet a pine°
For love, that every other day I faste”—
And gan his beste japes forth to caste;°
And made hir so to laughe at his folie,
That she for laughter wende for to die.°
 
And whan that she was comen into halle,
“Now, em,” quod she, “we wol go dine anoon”;
And gan some of hir women to hir calle,
And streight into hir chaumbre gan she goon;
But of hir besinesses,° this was oon
Amonges othere thinges, out of drede,°
Ful prively° this lettre for to rede;
 
Avised° word by word in every line,
And fond° no lak, she thoughte he coude good;°
And up° it putte, and went hir in to dine.
And Pandarus, that in a study° stood,
Er he was war,° she took him by the hood,
And seide, “Ye were caught er that ye wiste”;°
“I vouche sauf,”° quod he, “do what yow liste.”°
 
Tho wesshen° they, and sette hem doun and ete;
And after noon ful sleyly° Pandarus
Gan drawe him to the window next the strete,
And seide, “Nece, who hath arayed° thus
The yonder hous, that stant aforyein° us?”
“Which hous?” quod she, and gan for to biholde,°
And knew it wel, and whos it was him tolde,
 
And fillen forth in° speche of thinges smale,
And seten in the window° bothe tweie.
Whan Pandarus saw time unto his tale,°
And saw wel that hir folk were alle aweye,
“Now, nece min, tel on,” quod he, “I seye,
How liketh° yow the lettre that he wrote?
Can he theron?° for, by my trouthe, I noot.”°
 
Therwith al rosy hewed° tho wex she,
And gan to humme, and seide, “So I trowe.”°
“Aquite° him wel, for Goddes love,” quod he;
“Myself to medes° wol the lettre sowe,”°
And held his hondes up, and sat on knowe,°
“Now, goode nece, be it never so lite,°
Yif° me the labour, it to sowe and plite.”°
 
“Ye, for I can not write,”° quod she tho;
“And eek° I noot° what I shold to him seye.”
“Nay, nece,” quod Pandare, “sey not so;
Yet at the leste° thanketh him, I preie,
Of his good wil, and doth° him not to deie.
Now for the love of me, my nece dere,
Refuseth not at this time my preyere.”°
 
“Depardieux,”° quod she, “God leve° al be wel!
God help me so, this is the firste lettre
That ever I wroot, ye, al or any del.”°
And into a closet,° for t’avise hir° bettre,
She wente allone, and gan hir herte unfettre°
Out of disdaines prison but a lite;
And sette hir doun, and gan a lettre write,
 
Of which to telle in short° is min entente
Th’effect,° as fer as I can understonde: —
She thonked him of al that he wel mente
Towardes hir, but holden him in honde°
She nolde nought,° ne make hirselven bonde°
In love, but as his suster, him to plese,
She wolde ay fain,° to doon his herte an ese.°
 
She shette° it, and to Pandare gan goon,°
There as he sat and loked into strete,
And doun she sette hir by him on a stoon
Of jaspre,° upon a quisshin° gold ybete,°
And seide, “As wisly° help me God the grete,
I never dide a thing with more peine
Than write this, to which ye me constreine.”°
 
⇓And took it him: he thonked hir and seide,
“God woot, of thing ful often° looth° bigonne
Cometh ende good;° and nece min, Criseyde,
That ye to him of hard° now ben ywonne°
Oughte he be glad, by God and yonder sonne!
Forwhy° men seith, ‘Impressiounes lighte°
Ful lightly° been ay redy to° the flighte.’
 
“But ye han pleyed tiraunt neigh° to longe,
And hard was it your herte for to grave;°
Now stint,° that ye no longer on it honge,°
Al wolde ye the forme of daunger save;
But hasteth yow to doon him joye have;°
For trusteth wel, to longe ydoon hardnesse°
Causeth despit° ful often, for° distresse.”
 
And right as they declamed° this matere,
Lo, Troilus, right at the stretes ende,
Com riding with his tenthe some yfere,°
Al softely,° and thiderward gan bende°
Theras° they sete,° as was his wey to wende°
To paleisward; and Pandare him aspide,
And seide, “Nece, ysee who cometh here ride!°
 
“O flee not in, he seeth us, I suppose;°
Lest he may thinke that ye him eschuwe.”°
“Nay, nay,” quod she, and wex as reed° as rose.
With that he gan hir humbly to saluwe,°
With dreedful° chere, and ofte his hewes muwe;°
And up his look debonairly° he caste,
And bekked on° Pandare, and forth he paste.
 
God woot if he sat on his hors aright,
Or goodly° was besein,° that ilke° day!
God woot wher° he was lik a manly knight!
What° sholde I drecche,° or telle of his aray?°
Criseyde, which that al these thinges say,°
To telle in short, hir liked al yfere,°
His persone, his aray, his look, his chere,
 
His goodly° manere and his gentillesse,
So wel, that never, sith° that she was born,
Ne hadde she swich routhe of° his distresse;
And howso° she hath hard ben herbiforn,°
To God hope I,° she hath now caught° a thorn.
She shal not pulle it out this nexte wike;°
God sende mo° swich thornes on to pike!°
 
Pandare, which that° stood hir faste by,°
Felte iren hoot,° and he bigan to smite,°
And seide, “Nece, I pray yow hertely,
Tel me that° I shal axen yow a lite.°
A womman, that were of his deeth to wite,°
Withoute his gilt,° but for hir lakked routhe,°
Were it wel doon?” Quod she, “Nay, by my trouthe!”
 
“God help me so,” quod he, “ye sey me sooth.
Ye felen° wel yourself that I not lie;°
Lo, yond he rit!”° Quod she, “Ye, so he dooth.”
“Wel,” quod Pandare, “as I have told yow thrie,°
Lat be your nice shame° and your folie,
And spek with him in esing of his herte;
⇑Lat nicetee° not do yow bothe smerte.”°
 
But theron° was to heven° and to done;°
Considered al thing,° it may not be;
And why? For shame;° and it were eek to° sone
To graunten him so greet a libertee.
For plainly° hir entente, as seide she,
Was for to love him unwist,° if she mighte,
And guerdon° him with no thing but with sighte.
 
But Pandarus thoughte, “It shal not be so,
If that I may;° this nice° opinioun
Shal not be holden° fully yeres two.”
What sholde I make of this a long sermoun?
He moste assente on that conclusioun
As for the time;° and whan that it was eve,
And al was wel, he roos and took his leve.
 
And on his wey ful fast homward he spedde,
And right for joye he felte his herte daunce;
And Troilus he fond alone abedde,
That° lay as don these loveres, in a traunce,
Bitwixen hope and derk desesperaunce.°
But Pandarus, right at his incomminge,
He song,° as who seith,° “Lo! sumwhat° I bringe.”
 
And seide, “Who is in his bed so sone
Yburied° thus?” “It am I, freend,” quod he.
“Who, Troilus? nay help me so the mone,”°
Quod Pandarus, “thou shalt arise and see
A charme that was sent right now to thee,
The which can helen° thee of thin accesse,°
If thou do forth° with al thy besinesse.”°
 
“Ye, through the might of God!” quod Troilus.
And Pandarus gan him the lettre take,°
And seide, “Pardee, God hath holpen° us;
Have here a light, and loke on al this blake.”°
But ofte gan the herte glade° and quake°
Of Troilus, whil that he gan it rede,
So as° the wordes yave him hope or drede.°
 
But finally, he took al for the beste
That she him wroot, for sumwhat he biheld
On which, him thoughte,° he mighte his herte reste,
Al° covered she the wordes under sheld.°
Thus to the more worthy° part he held,
That, what for hope and Pandarus biheste,°
His grete wo foryede° he at the leste.
 
But as we may alday° ourselven° see,
Through° more wode° or col,° the more fir;
Right so encrees of hope, of what it be,°
Therwith ful ofte encreseth eek desir;
Or, as an ook° cometh of a litel spir,°
So through this lettre, which that she him sente,
Encresen gan desir, of which he brente.°
 
Wherfore I seye alwey, that day and night
This Troilus gan to desiren more
Than he dide erst,° thurgh hope, and dide his might
To pressen on,° as by° Pandarus lore,°
And writen to hir of his sorwes sore
Fro day to day; he leet it not refreide,°
That by Pandare he wroot somwhat or seide;
 
And dide also his othere observaunces
That to a lovere longeth° in this cas;°
And, after that° these dees° turnede on chaunces,°
So was he outher° glad or seide “Allas!”
And held after his gestes° ay his pas;°
And aftir swiche answeres as he hadde,
So were his dayes sory outher° gladde.
 
But to Pandare alwey was his recours,°
And pitously gan ay til him° to pleine,
And him bisoughte of° rede° and som socours;°
And Pandarus, that sey° his wode° peine,
Wex wel neigh° deed for routhe,° sooth to seyne,°
And bisily° with al his herte caste°
Som of his wo to sleen,° and that as faste;°
 
And seide, “Lord, and freend, and brother dere,
God woot° that thy disese dooth me wo.°
But woltow stinten° al this woful chere,°
And, by my trouthe, or° it be dayes two,
And God toforn,° yet shal I shape° it so,
That thou shalt come into a certain place,
Theras° thou mayst thyself hir preie of grace.°
 
“And certainly, I noot° if thou it wost,°
But tho that° been expert in love it seye,
It is oon of the thinges that furthereth most,°
A man to have a leiser° for to preie,°
And siker° place his wo for to biwreie;°
For in good herte° it moot som routhe° impresse,°
To here and see the giltles in distresse.
 
“Paraunter° thenkestow:° though it be so
That Kinde° wolde doon hir° to biginne
To han a maner routhe° upon my wo,
Seith Daunger,° ‘Nay, thou shalt me nevere winne’;°
So reuleth° hir hir hertes goost° withinne,
That, though she bende,° yet she stant° on rote;°
What in effect is this unto my bote?°
 
“Thenk hereayeins,° whan that the sturdy ook,
On which men hakketh ofte, for the nones,°

The grete sweigh° doth it come al at ones,°
As doon these rokkes or these milne stones.°
For swifter cours cometh thing that is of wighte,°

“And reed° that boweth doun for every blast,°

It nedeth me nought° thee longe to forbise.°

⇓“But, Troilus, yet tel me, if thee lest,°
A thing now which that I shal axen thee;
Which is thy brother that thou lovest best
As in° thy verray hertes privetee?”°
“Ywis,° my brother Deiphebus,” quod he.
“Now,” quod Pandare, “er° houres twyes twelve,°
He shal thee ese,° unwist° of it himselve.
 
“Now lat m’alone,° and werken as I may,”
Quod he; and to Deiphebus wente he tho°
Which hadde his lord and grete freend ben ay;
Save° Troilus, no man he loved so.
To telle in short, withouten wordes mo,
Quod Pandarus, “I pray yow that ye be
Freend to a cause which that toucheth° me.”
 
“Yis, pardee,” quod Deiphebus, “wel thow wost,°
In al that ever I may, and God tofore,°
Al nere it but° for man I love most,
My brother Troilus; but sey wherfore
It is; for sith° that day that I was bore,

Ayeins° a thing that mighte thee forthinke.”°
 
Pandare gan him thonke,° and to him seide,
“Lo, sire, I have a lady in this toun,
That is my nece, and called is Criseyde,
Which som men wolden doon oppressioun,°
And wrongfully have hir possessioun:°
Wherfor I of your lordship° yow biseche
To been our freend,° withoute more speche.”
 
Deiphebus him answerde, “O, is not this,
That thow spekest of to me thus straungely,°
Crisëyda, my freende?” He seide, “Yis.”
“Than nedeth,” quod Deiphebus hardely,°
“Namore to speke, for trusteth wel, that I
Wol be hir champioun with spore° and yerde;°
I roughte nought° though° alle hir foos° it herde
 
“But tel me, thou that woost° al this matere,
How I might best availen?° now lat see.”
Quod Pandarus, “If ye, my lord so dere,
Wolden as now° don this honour to me,
To prayen° hir tomorwe, lo, that she
Com unto yow hir pleintes to devise,°
Hir adversaries wolde of it agrise.°
 
“And if I more dorste preie as now,
And chargen yow to have° so greet travaile,°

That mighten to hir cause bet availe,°
Than, woot I wel, she mighte never faile
For to be holpen,° what at your instaunce,°
What with° hir othere freendes governaunce.”
 
Deiphebus, which that comen was of kinde°
To al honour and bountee° to consente,°
Answerde, “It shal be doon; and I can finde
Yet gretter help to this in min entente.°
What wolt thow seyn, if I for Eleine sente
To speke of this? I trowe° it be the beste;
For she may leden° Paris as hir leste.°
 
“Of Ector, which that is my lord, my brother,

It nedeth nought his helpes for to crave;°
He shal be swich,° right as we wole him have.°
 
“Spek thou thyself also to Troilus
On my bihalve, and pray him with us dine.”
“Sire, al this shal be doon,” quod Pandarus;
And took his leve, and never gan to fine,°
But° to his neces hous, as streit° as line,
He com; and fond hir fro the mete° arise;
And sette him doun, and spak right in this wise.°
 
He seide, “O veray° God, so have I ronne!°
Lo, nece min, see ye nought how I swete?°
I noot° whether ye the more thank me conne.°
Be ye nought war° how that fals Poliphete

“I? no,” quod she, and chaunged al hir hewe.
 
“What° is he more aboute,° me to drecche°

No fors of that,° lat him have al yfere;°
 
“Withouten° that, I have ynough° for us.”
“Nay,” quod Pandare, “it shal no thing be so.
For I have been right now at Deiphebus,
And Ector, and mine othere lordes mo,°
And shortly maked° eche of hem his fo;
That, by my thrift,° he shal it never winne
For ought he can,° whan that so he biginne.”
 
And as they casten° what was best to done,
Deiphebus, of his owene curtasie,°
Com hir to preie,° in his propre persone,°
To holde° him on the morwe companie
At diner, which she nolde not denie,°
But goodly° gan to his preiere° obeie.°
He thonked hir, and wente upon his weie.
 
Whanne this was doon, this Pandare up anoon,°
To telle in short, and forth gan for to wende°
To Troilus, as° stille as any stoon,
And al this thing he tolde him, word and ende;°
And how that he Deiphebus gan to blende;°
And seide him, “Now is time, if that thou conne,°
To bere thee° wel tomorwe, and al is wonne.
 
“Now spek, now prey, now pitously compleine;
Lat not° for nice shame,° or drede, or slouthe;
Som time a man mot° telle his owene peine;
Bileve it, and she shal han on thee routhe;°
Thou shalt be saved by thy feith, in trouthe.
But wel wot° I, that thou art now in drede;
And what it is, I leie,° I can arede.°
 
“Thow thinkest now, ‘How sholde I doon al this?
For by my cheres° mosten folk aspie,°

Yet hadde I lever° unwist° for sorwe die.’
Now think not so, for thou dost greet folie.
For I right now have founden o manere°
Of sleighte,° for to coveren° al thy chere.
 
“Thow shalt gon over night,° and that as blive,°
Unto Deiphebus hous, as thee to pleie,°

Forwhy° thou semest sik, soth for to seye.°
Sone after that, doun in thy bed thee leye,°
And sey, thow mayst no lenger up endure,
And lie right there, and bide thin aventure.°
 
“Sey that thy fever is wont° thee for to take
The same time, and lasten til amorwe;°
And lat see now how wel thou canst it make,°
For, pardee,° sik is he that is in sorwe.
Go now, farewel! and, Venus here to borwe,°
I hope, and thou this purpos holde ferme,
Thy grace° she shal fully ther conferme.”
 
Quod Troilus, “Ywis,° thou nedelees
Counseilest me, that sikliche I me feine!°
For I am sik in ernest,° doutelees,
So that wel neigh I sterve° for the peine.”
Quod Pandarus, “Thou shalt the bettre pleine,
And hast° the lasse need° to countrefete;
For him men demen° hoot that men seen swete.°
 
“Lo, holde thee at thy triste cloos,° and I
Shal wel the deer unto thy bowe° drive.”
Therwith he took his leve al softely,°
And Troilus to paleis wente blive.°
So glad ne was he nevere in al his live;
And to Pandarus reed° gan al assente,
And to Deiphebus hous at night he wente.
 
What nedeth yow to tellen° al the chere°
That Deiphebus unto his brother made,
Or his accesse,° or his siklich° manere,
How men gan him with clothes° for to lade,°
Whan he was leid,° and how men wolde him glade?°
But al for nought, he held forth ay the wise
That ye han herd Pandare er° this devise.
 
But certein is, er Troilus him leide,°
Deiphebus had him prayed, over night,°
To been a freend and helping° to Criseyde.
God woot, that he it grauntede anonright,
To been hir fulle° freend with al his might.
But swich a nede was° to preie° him thenne,
As for to° bidde° a wood° man for to renne.°
 
The morwen° com, and neighen gan° the time
Of meel tid,° that the faire quene Eleine
Shoop hir° to been, an houre after the prime,°
With Deiphebus, to whom she nolde feine;°
But as his suster, hoomly,° sooth to seyne,
She com to diner in hir plain entente.°
But° God and Pandare wiste° al what this mente.
 
Come eek Criseyde, al innocent° of this,
Antigone, hir sister Tarbe also;
But flee we now prolixitee° best is,°
For love of God, and lat us faste go
Right to the effect,° withoute tales mo,°
Why al this folk assembled in this place;
And lat us of hir saluinges° pace.°
 
Gret honour dide hem Deiphebus, certein,
And fedde hem wel with al that mighte like.°
But evermore, “Allas!” was his refrein,
“My goode brother Troilus, the sike,°
Lith yet”°—and therwithal he gan to sike;°
And after that, he peined him to glade°
Hem° as he mighte, and chere good he made.°
 
Compleined° eek Eleine of his siknesse
So feithfully,° that pitee was to here,°
And every wight gan waxen° for accesse°
A leche° anoon, and seide, “In this manere
Men curen folk; this charme° I wol yow lere.”°
But there sat oon, al list hir nought to teche,°
That° thoughte, “Best coude I yet been his leche.”°
 
After compleint, him gonnen they to preise,
As folk don yet, whan som wight hath bigonne
To preise a man, and up with pris° him reise°
A thousand fold yet hyer° than the sonne:—
“He is, he can, that° fewe lordes conne.”°
And Pandarus, of that° they wolde afferme,
He not forgat° hir° preising to conferme.
 
Herde al this thing Criseyde wel ynough,
And every word gan for to notifie;°
For which with sobre chere° hir herte lough;°
For who is that ne wolde hir glorifie,°
To mowen° swich a knight don° live or die?
But al passe° I, lest ye to longe dwelle;°
For for o fin° is al that ever I telle.°
 
The time com fro diner for to rise,
And, as hem oughte,° arisen everychoon,°
And gonne a while of this and that devise.°
But Pandarus brak° al this speche anoon,
And seide to Deiphebus, “Wol ye goon,°
If youre wille be, as I yow preide,°
To speke here of the nedes of Criseyde?”
 
Eleine, which that by the hond hir helde,
Took first the tale,° and seide, “Go we blive”;°
And goodly° on Criseyde she bihelde,°
And seide, “Joves° lat him never thrive,°
That dooth yow harm, and bringe him sone of live!°
And yeve° me sorwe, but° he shal it rewe,°
If that I may,° and alle folk be trewe.”°
 
“Tel thou thy neces cas,”° quod Deiphebus
To Pandarus, “For thou canst best it telle.” —
“My lordes and my ladies, it stant° thus;
What° sholde I lenger,” quod he, “do yow dwelle?”°
He rong° hem out a proces° lik a belle,°
Upon hir fo, that highte° Poliphete,
So hëinous,° that men mighte on it spete.°
 
Answerde of this° ech worse of hem° than other,
And Poliphete they gonnen thus to warien,°
“Anhonged° be swich oon, were° he my brother;
And so he shal, for it ne may not varien.”°
What° sholde I lenger in this tale° tarien?°
Pleinly,° alle at ones,° they hir highten,°
To been hir helpe in al that ever° they mighten.
 
Spak than Eleine, and seide, “Pandarus,
Woot ought° my Lord, my brother, this matere,
I mene, Ector? or woot it Troilus?”
He seide, “Ye, but wol ye now me here?°
Me thinketh° this, sith° Troilus is here,
It were° good, if that ye° wolde assente,°
She tolde hirself him° al this, er she wente.
 
“For he wole have the more hir grief at herte,°
By cause, lo, that she a lady° is;
And, by your leve, I wol but° in right sterte,°
And do yow wite,° and that anoon, ywis,
If that he slepe, or wole ought° here of this.”
And in he lepte, and seide him in his ere,
“God have thy soule, ybrought° have I thy bere!”°
 
To smilen of this gan tho Troilus,
And Pandarus, withoute rekeninge,°
Out wente anoon to Eleine and Deiphebus,
And seide hem, “So there be no taryinge,
Ne more pres,° he wol wel° that ye bringe
Crisëyda, my lady, that is here;
And as he may enduren,° he wol here.
 
“But wel ye woot, the chaumbre is but lite,°
And fewe folk may lightly° make it warm;°
Now loketh ye° (for I wol have no wite,°
To bringe in prees° that mighte doon him harme

Wher° it be bet° she bide til eftsones;°
Now loketh ye, that knowen what to doon is.°
 
“I sey for me, best° is, as I can knowe,
That no wight in ne wente° but ye tweie,°
But° it were I, for I can, in a throwe,°
Reherce hir cas, unlik that° she can seye;
And after this, she may him ones preie
To ben good lord, in short, and take hir leve;
This may not muchel° of his ese° him reve.°
 
“And eek, for she is straunge,° he wol forbere°
His ese, which that° him thar nought° for yow;
Eek other thing,° that toucheth not to here,°
He wol° me telle, I woot it wel right now,
That secret is, and for the tounes prow.”°
And they, that no thing knewe of this entente,
Withoute more,° to Troilus in they wente.
 
Eleine in al hir goodly softe wise,°
Gan him saluwe,° and womanly to pleie,°
And seide, “Ywis, ye moste alweyes° arise!
Now faire brother, beth al hool, I preie!”
And gan hir arm right over his sholder leie,
And him with al hir wit to recomforte;°
As she best coude, she gan him to disporte.°
 
So after this quod she, “We yow biseke,°
My dere brother, Deiphebus, and I,
For love of God, and so doth Pandare eke,
To been good lord and freend, right hertely,°
Unto Criseyde, which that certeinly

That° can hir cas° wel bet than I declare.”
 
This Pandarus gan newe his tunge affile,°
And al hir cas reherce, and that anoon;
Whan it was seid, sone after, in a while,
Quod Troilus, “As sone as I may goon,°
I wol right fain° with al my might ben oon,°

“Good thrift° have ye,” quod Eleyne the quene.
 
Quod Pandarus, “And it your wille be,°
That she° may take hir leve,° er° that she go?”
“Or elles° God forbede,” tho quod he,
“If that she vouche sauf° for to do so.”
And with that word quod Troilus, “Ye two,

To yow have I to speke of o° matere,
 
“To been avised by your reed° the bettre”:—
And fond,° as hap was,° at his beddes heed,

He preyede hem anoon on it avise.°
 
Deiphebus gan this lettre to unfolde

Now lat hem rede,° and turne we anoon
To Pandarus, that gan ful faste prie°
That al was wel, and out he gan to goon
Into the grete chambre, and that in hie,°
And seide, “God save al this companie!
Com, nece min; my lady quene Eleine
Abideth° yow, and eek my lordes tweine.
 
“Ris, take with yow your nece Antigone,
Or whom yow list,° or no fors,° hardily;°

And loke° that ye thonke humblely

Lest we to longe his restes him bireve.”°
 
Al innocent° of Pandarus entente,
Quod tho Criseyde, “Go we,° uncle dere”;
And arm in arm inward with him she wente,
Avised° wel hir wordes and hir chere;°
And Pandarus, in ernestful° manere,
Seide, “Alle folk, for Goddes love, I preie,
Stinteth° right here, and softely yow pleie.
 
Aviseth yow° what folk ben here withinne,
And in what plit° oon is, God him amende!°
And inward° thus “Ful softely° biginne;

But now to yow, ye lovers that ben here,
Was Troilus nought in a cankedort,°
That lay, and mighte whispringe of hem here,°
And thoughte, “O lord, right now renneth° my sort°

And was° the firste time he shulde° hir preie

O verray cause of hele° and of gladnesse,

In hevene and helle, in erthe and salte see

God loveth, and to love wol nought werne;°
And in this world no lives° creature,

To which gladnes, who nede hath,° God him bringe!°

⇓Lay al this mene while° Troilus,
Recordinge° his lessoun in this manere,
“Ma fey!”° thought he, “Thus wole I seye and thus;
Thus wole I pleine° unto my lady dere;
That word is good, and this shal be my chere;°
This nil I° not foryeten in no wise.”
God leve him werken° as he gan devise.°
 
And Lord, so that° his herte gan to quappe,°
Heringe hir come, and shorte for to sike!°
And Pandarus, that ladde hir by the lappe,°
Com ner,° and gan in at the curtin° pike,°
And seide, “God do bote° on alle sike!°
See, who is here yow comen to visite;
Lo, here is she that is your deeth to wite.”°
 
Therwith it semed as he wepte almost;
“A ha,”° quod Troilus so rewfully,
“Wher° me be wo,° O mighty God, thou wost!°
Who is al there? I see nought trewely.”°
“Sir,” quod Criseyde, “it is Pandare and I.”
“Ye, swete herte? allas, I may nought rise
To knele, and do yow honour in som wise.”°
 
And dressede° him upward, and she right tho
Gan bothe here hondes softe° upon him leye,
“O, for the love of God, do ye not so
To me,” quod she, “ey! What is this to seye?°
Sir, come am I to yow for causes tweie;°
First, yow to thonke, and of your lordshipe° eke
Continuaunce° I wolde yow biseke.”
 
This Troilus, that° herde his lady preye
Of lordship him, wex° neither quik° ne deed,
Ne mighte o° word for shame to it seye,
Although° men sholde smiten of° his heed.
But Lord, so he wex sodeinliche° reed,
And sire, his lesson, that he wende conne,°
To preyen° hir, is thurgh his wit yronne.°
 
Criseyde al this aspyede° wel ynough,
For she was wis, and lovede him never the lasse,
Al nere° he malapert,° or made it tough,°
Or° was to bold, to singe a fool a masse.°
But whan his shame gan somwhat to passe,
His resons,° as° I may my rimes holde,
I yow wol telle, as techen° bokes olde.°
 
In chaunged° vois, right for° his verrey drede,°
Which vois eek quook,° and therto his manere
Goodly abaist,° and now his hewes° rede,
Now pale, unto Criseyde, his lady dere,
With look doun cast and humble yolden° chere,
Lo, the alderfirste° word that him asterte°
Was, twyes, “Mercy, mercy, swete herte!”
 
And stinte° a whil, and whan he mighte out bringe,
The nexte word was, “God wot,° for I have,
As feithfully as I have had konninge,°
Ben youres, also God my sowle save;°
And shal, til that I, woful wight, be grave.°
And though I dar ne can° unto yow pleine,°
Ywis, I suffre nought the lasse peine.
 
Thus muche as now,° O wommanliche wif,°

That shal I wreke° upon min owne lif
Right sone, I trowe, and doon your herte an ese,°
If with my deeth your herte I may apese.°
But sin that ye han herd me somwhat seye,°
Now recche° I never how sone that I deye.”
 
Therwith his manly sorwe to biholde,
It mighte han maad an herte of stoon to rewe;°
And Pandare weep as he to watre wolde,°
And poked ever his nece newe and newe,°
And seide, “Wo bigon° ben hertes trewe!
For love of God, make of this thing an ende,
Or slee° us bothe at ones, er° that ye wende.”°
 
“I? what?” quod she, “By God and by my trouthe,°
I noot nought° what ye wilne° that I seye.”
“I? what?” quod he, “that ye han on him routhe,°
For Goddes love, and doth him nought to deie.”°
“Now thanne thus,” quod she, “I wolde him preye
To telle me the fin° of his entente;°
Yet° wiste° I never wel what that he mente.”
 
“What that I mene, O swete herte dere?”
Quod Troilus, “O goodly° fresshe° free!°
That, with the stremes° of your eyen clere,
Ye wolde somtime freendly on me see,°
And thanne agreën that I may ben he,
Withoute braunche° of vice in any wise,
In trouthe alwey to doon yow my servise

With al my wit and al my diligence,
And I to han, right as yow list,° comfort,
Under your yerde,° egal° to min offence,

And I to ben your verray° humble trewe,°

And, with good herte, al holly° your talent°

Quod Pandarus, “Lo, here an hard request,
And resonable, a lady for to werne!°
Now, nece min, by natal Joves fest,°
Were I a god, ye sholde sterve° as yerne,°
That heren° wel, this man wol nothing yerne°
But your honour, and seen him almost sterve,°
And been so looth° to suffren° him yow serve.”°
 
With that she gan hir eyen on him caste
Ful esily,° and ful debonairly,°
Avising hir,° and hyed° not to faste
With never a word, but seide him softely,
“Min honour sauf,° I wol wel trewely,°
And in swich forme as he can now devise,
Receiven° him fully to my servise,
 
“Biseching him, for Goddes love, that he
Wolde, in honour of trouthe and gentilesse,
As I wel mene,° eek mene wel to me,
And min honour, with wit° and besinesse,°

From hennesforth, ywis, I nil not feine:°

“But nathelees, this warne I yow,” quod she,
“A kinges sone although ye be, ywis,

“And shortly, derë herte and al my knight,

If I be she that may yow do gladnesse,
For every wo ye shal recovere° a blisse”;°
And him in armes took, and gan him kisse.
 
Fil° Pandarus on knees, and up his yën
To heven threw, and held his hondes hie,
“Immortal god!” quod he, “that mayst nought dyen,
Cupide I mene, of this mayst glorifie;°
And Venus, thou mayst° make melodie;

With that Eleine and also Deiphebus

In wrecchednesse, in filthe, and in vermine,°
Caitif to° cruel king Agamenoun;
And this, in alle the temples of this toun,
Upon the goddes alle, I wol thee swere,
Tomorwe day,° if that thee liketh here.°
 
“And that thou hast so muche ydoon° for me,
That I ne may it never more deserve,
This knowe I wel, al° mighte I now for thee
A thousand times on a morwen° sterve,°
I can no more,° but that I wol thee serve
Right as thy sclave,° whiderso° thou wende,
For evermore, unto my lives ende!
 
“But here, with al min herte, I thee biseche,
That never in me thou deme° swich folie°
As I shal seyn; me thoughte,° by thy speche,
That this, which thou me dost for companie,°
I sholde wene° it were a bauderie;°
I am nought wood,° al if I lewed be;°
It is not so, that woot I wel, pardee.
 
“But he that goth,° for gold or for richesse,°
On swich message,° calle him what thee list
And this that thou dost, calle it gentilesse,°
Compassioun, and felawship, and trist;°
Departe it so,° for widewhere° is wist°
How that there is diversitee° requered
Bitwixen thinges like,° as I have lered.°
 
“And, that° thou knowe I thenke nought ne wene°
That this servise a shame be or jape,°
I have my faire suster Polixene,
Cassandre, Eleine, or any of the frape;°
Be she never so faire or wel yshape,°
Tel me, which thou wilt of everichone,°
To han for thin, and lat me thanne allone.°
 
“But sin that thou hast don me this servise,
My lif to save, and for noon hope of mede,°
So, for the love of God, this grete emprise°
Parforme it out;° for now is moste nede.°
For high and low,° withouten any drede,
I wol alwey thine hestes° alle kepe;
Have now good night, and lat us bothe slepe.”
 
Thus held him ech of other° wel apaied,°
That al the world ne mighte it bet amende;°
And, on the morwe, whan they were araied,°
Ech to his owene nedes gan entende.°
But Troilus, though as the fir he brende°
For sharp desir of hope and of plesaunce,
He not forgat° his wise governaunce.°
 
⇓But in himself with manhod° gan restreine
Ech rakel° dede and ech unbridled chere,°
That alle tho that liven, sooth to seyne,
Ne sholde han wist,° by word or by manere,
What that he mente, as touching° this matere.
From every wight as fer° as is the cloude°
He was, so wel dissimulen° he coude.
 
And al the whil which that I yow devise,°
This was his lif; with al his fulle might,
By day he was in Martes high servise,
This is to seyn, in armes as a knight;
And for the more° part, the longe° night
He lay, and thoughte how that he mighte serve
His lady best, hir thank° for to deserve.
 
Nil I nought° swerë, although he lay softe,°
That in his thought he nas sumwhat disesed,°
Ne that he tornede° on his pilwes° ofte,
And wolde of that him missed han ben sesed;°
But in swich cas man is nought alwey plesed,
For ought I wot,° no more than was he;
That can I deme of possibilitee.°
 
But certein is,° to purpos for to go,°
That in this while, as writen is in geste,°
He say° his lady somtime; and also
She with him spak, whan that she dorste° or leste,°
And by hir bothe avis,° as was the beste,
Apointeden° ful warly° in this nede,
So as they dorste, how they wold procede.
 
But it was spoken in so short a wise,
In swich await° alwey, and in swich fere°
Lest any wight divinen° or devise°
Wolde of hem two, or to it leye an ere,°
That al this world so leef° to hem ne were°
As that° Cupido wolde hem grace sende
To maken of hir° speche aright° an ende.
 
But thilke litel° that they spake or wroughte,°
His wise goost° took ay of al swich hede,
It semed hir,° he wiste° what she thoughte
Withouten word, so that it was no nede
To bidde him ought to done, or ought forbede;°
For which hir thought that love, al come it° late,
Of alle joye hadde opned hir the yate.°
 
And shortly of this proces° for to pace,
So wel his werk and wordes he bisette,°
That he so ful stood in his lady grace,°
That twenty thousand times, or she lette,°
She thonked God she° ever with him mette;
So coude he° him governe in swich servise,
That al the world ne mighte it bet devise.°
 
Forwhy° she fond him so discreet in al,
So secret, and of swich obeisaunce,°
That wel she felte he was to hir a wal
Of steel, and sheld from every displesaunce;°
That, to ben in his gode governaunce,°
So wis he was, she was no more afered,°
I mene, as fer as oughte ben° requered.
 
And Pandarus, to quike° alwey° the fir,
Was ever ylike prest° and diligent;
To ese° his frend was set al his desir.
He shof° ay on, he to and fro was sent;
He lettres bar° whan Troilus was absent.
That never man, as in° his freendes nede,
Ne bar him° bet than he, withouten drede.°
 
But now, paraunter,° som man waiten° wolde
That every word, or sonde,° or look, or chere°
Of Troilus that I rehersen° sholde,
In al this while, unto his lady dere;
I trowe it were a long thing for to here;
Or of what wight° that stant° in swich disjointe,°
His wordes alle, or every look, to pointe.°
 
For sothe,° I have not herd it doon er° this,
In storie noon,° ne no man here, I wene;
And though I wolde° I coude not,° ywis;
For ther was som epistel° hem bitwene,
That wolde, as seith min auctor, wel contene°
Neigh° half this book, of which him list not°write;
How sholde I thanne a line of it endite?°
 
But to the grete effect:° than sey I thus,
That stonding in concord and in quiete
Thise ilke° two, Criseyde and Troilus,
As I have told, and in this time swete,°
Save only° often mighte they not mete,
Ne laiser° have hir speches to fulfelle,°
That it befel° right as I shal yow telle,
 
That Pandarus, that ever dide his might°
Right for the fin° that I shal speke of here,
As° for to bringe to his hous som night
His faire nece, and Troilus yfere,°
Wheras° at leiser al this heigh matere,
Touching hir love, were at the fulle° upbounde,°
Hadde out of doute a time to it° founde.
 
For he with greet deliberacioun
Hadde every thing that herto mighte availe°
Forncast,° and put in execucioun,
And neither laft,° for cost ne for travaile;°
Come if hem lest, hem sholde no thing faile;°
And for to been in ought° espyed there,
That, wiste he wel, an inpossible° were.
 
Dredelees,° it cleer was in the wind°
Of every pie° and every lette-game;°
Now al is wel, for al the world is blind
In this matere, bothe fremed° and tame.
This timber is al redy up to frame;°
Us lakketh° nought but° that we witen° wolde
A certein houre, in which she comen sholde.
 
And Troilus, that al this purveiaunce,°
Knew at the fulle,° and waitede on it° ay,°
Hadde hereupon eek made gret ordenaunce,°
And founde his cause,° and therto his aray,°
If that he were missed, night or day,
Therwhile° he was aboute this servise,
That he was goon to doon his sacrifise
 
And moste° at swich a temple alone wake,°
Answered of° Appollo for° to be;
And first, to seen the holy laurer° quake,
Er that Apollo spak out of the tree,
To telle him next whan Grekes sholden flee,
And forthy lette him no man,° God forbede,
But preye Apollo helpen in this nede.
 
Now is ther litel more for to done,
But Pandare up,° and shortly for to seyne,
Right sone upon the chaunging of the mone,°
Whan lightles is the world a night or tweine,
And that the welken° shoop him for° to reine,
He streight amorwe° unto his nece wente;
Ye han wel herd the fin° of his entente.
 
Whan he was come, he gan anoon to pleye
As he was wont, and at himself° to jape;
And finally, he swor and gan hir seye,
By this and that, she sholde him not escape,
Ne lenger doon him° after hir to cape;°
But certeinly she moste, by hir leve°
Come soupen° in his hous with him at eve.
 
At which she lough, and gan hir faste°excuse,
And seide, “It raineth; lo, how sholde I goon?”
“Lat be,”° quod he, “ne stond not thus to muse;°
This moot° be doon, ye shal be ther anoon.”
So at the laste herof they felle at oon,°
Or elles, softe° he swor° hir in hir ere,
He nolde never come ther she were.°
 
Soone after this she to him gan to rowne,°
And asked him if Troilus were there?
He swor hir, “Nay, for he was out of towne,”
And seide, “Nece, I pose° that he were,
Yow thurfte° never have the more fere.°
For rather than men mighte him ther aspie,
Me were lever° a thousandfold to die.”
 
Nought list° min auctor fully to declare
What that she thoughte whan he seide so,
That Troilus was out of town yfare,°
As if° he seide therof sooth° or no;
But that, withoute await,° with him to go,
She graunted him, sith° he hir that bisoughte,°
And, as his nece, obeyed as hir oughte.
 
But nathelees, yet gan she him biseche,
Although with him to goon it was no fere,°
For to be war of goosish° peples speche,
That dremen° thinges which that never were,
And wel avise him° whom he broughte there;
And seide him,° “Em,° sin° I mot° on yow triste,
Loke° al be wel, for I do that yow liste.”°
 
He swor hir, “Yis, by stokkes° and by stones,°
And by the goddes that in heven dwelle,
Or elles were him lever,° soule and bones,
With Pluto king as depe been in helle
As Tantalus!” What sholde I more telle?
Whan al was wel, he roos and took his leve,
And she to souper° com, whan it was eve,
 
With a certain° of hir owne men,
And with hir faire nece Antigone,
And othere of hir wommen nine or ten;
But who was glad now, who, as trowe ye,°
But Troilus, that stood and mighte it see
Thurghout° a litel windowe in a stewe,°
Ther° he bishet,° sin° midnight, was in mewe,°
 
Unwist of° every wight but of° Pandare?
But to the point; now whan she was ycome°
With alle joye, and alle frendes fare,°
Hir em anoon in armes hath hir nome,°
And after to the souper, alle and some,°
Whan time was, ful softe° they hem sette;
God wot, ther was no deintee° for to fette.°
 
And after souper gonnen they to rise,
At ese wel, with hertes fresshe° and glade,
And wel was him that coude best devise°
To liken hir,° or that hir laughen made.
He song; she pleide; he tolde a tale of Wade.°
But at the laste, as° every thing hath ende,
She took hir leve, and nedes° wolde wende.°
 
But O, Fortune, executrice° of wierdes,°
O influences of thise hevenes hie!
Soth° is, that, under God, ye ben our hierdes,°
Though to us bestes° been the causes wrie.°
This mene I now, for she gan° hoomward hie,°
But execut° was al biside hir leve°
The goddes wil; for which she moste bleve.°
 
The bente° mone with hir hornes pale,
Saturne and Jove in Cancro° joined were,
That swich a rain from heven gan avale,°
That every maner womman that was there
Hadde of that smoky° rein a verray fere;°
At which Pandare tho lough,° and seide thenne,
“Now were it time° a lady to go henne!°
 
“But goode nece, if I mighte ever plese
Yow any thing, than prey I yow,” quod he,
“To doon min herte° as now° so greet an ese
As for to dwelle here al this night with me,
Forwhy° this is your owen hous, pardee.
For, by my trouthe, I sey it nought agame,°
To wende as now, it were to me a shame.”°
 
Criseyde, whiche that coude° as muche good
As half a world, tok hede of his preiere;
And sin it ron,° and al was on a flood,°
She thoughte, “As good chep° may I dwellen here,
And graunte it gladly with a freendes chere,
And have a thank,° as° grucche° and thanne abide;
For hoom to goon it may nought wel bitide.”°
 
“I wol,”° quod she, “min uncle leef° and dere,
Sin that yow list,° it skile° is to be so;
I am right glad with yow to dwellen here;
I seide but agame,° I wolde go.”
“Ywis, graunt mercy, nece!” quod he tho;
“Were it a game or no, soth° for to telle,
Now am I glad, sin that yow list° to dwelle.”°
 
Thus al is wel; but tho bigan aright°
The newe daunce, and al the feste° again;
But Pandarus, if goodly hadde he might,°
He wolde han hyed° hir to bedde fain,°
And seide, “Lord, this is an huge rain!
This were a weder° for to slepen inne;
And that I rede° us sone to biginne.
 
“And nece, woot ye° wher I wol yow leye,°
For that° we shul not liggen° fer asonder,°
And for° ye neither shullen,° dar I seye,
Heren° noise of reines nor of thondre?
By God, right in my lite° closet yonder.
And I wol° in that outer hous° allone
Be wardein° of yow° wommen everichone.
 
“And in this middel chaumbre that ye see
Shul youre wommen slepen wel and softe;°
And there besidin° shal yourselve be;
And if ye liggen° wel tonight, com ofte,
And careth not what weder° is onlofte.°
The win° anon,° and whan so that yow leste,°
So go we° slepe, I trowe° it be the beste.”
 
Ther nis no more,° but hereafter sone,
The voidè° dronke, and travers drawe° anon,
Gan every wight, that hadde nought to done°
More in that place, out of the chaumber gon.
And evermo so sternelich° it ron,°
And blew therwith so wonderliche loude,
That wel neigh no man heren other° coude.
 
Tho Pandarus, hir em, right as him oughte,
With women swiche as were hir most aboute,°
Ful glad unto hir beddes side hir broughte,
And toke his leve, and gan ful lowe loute,°
And seid, “Here at this closet dore withoute,°
Right overthwart,° your wommen liggen alle,
That, whom yow liste of hem,° ye may here calle.”
 
So whan that she was in the closet° leid,°
And alle hir wommen forth by ordenaunce°
Abedde° weren, ther as I have seid,
There was no more to skippen° nor to traunce,°
But boden° go to bedde, with mischaunce,°
If any wight was steringe° anywhere,
And late hem° slepe that° abedde were.
 
But Pandarus, that wel coude° eche a del°
The olde daunce,° and every point therinne,
Whan that he sey° that alle thing was wel,
He thoughte he wolde upon his werk biginne,
And gan the stewe dore al softe° unpinne,°
And stille as stoon, withouten lenger lette,°
By Troilus adoun right he him sette.°
 
And, shortly to the point right for to gon,
Of al this werk° he tolde him word and ende,°
And seide, “Make thee° redy right anon,
For thou shalt into heven° blisse wende.”
“Now blisful Venus, thou me grace sende,”
Quod Troilus, “for never yet° no nede
Hadde I er° now, ne halvendel° the drede.”°
 
Quod Pandarus, “Ne drede thee° never a del,°
For it shal ben right as thou wilt desire;
So thrive I,° this night shal I make it wel,
Or casten° al the gruwel° in the fire.”
“Yit blisful Venus, this night thou me enspire,”°
Quod Troilus, “as wis° as I thee serve,
And ever bet° and bet shal, til I sterve.°
 
“And if I hadde, O Venus ful of mirthe,
Aspectes badde° of Mars or of Saturne,
Or thou combust° or let° were in my birthe,
Thy fader° prey al thilke° harm disturne°
Of grace,° and that I glad ayein may turne,
For love of him thou lovedest in the shawe,°
I mene Adoon,° that with the boor° was slawe.°
 
“O jove eek, for the love of faire Europe,
The whiche° in forme of bole° away thou fette;°
Now help, O Mars, thou with thy blody cope,°
For love of Cipris, thou me nought ne lette;°
O Phebus, thenk whan Dane° hirselven shette°
Under the bark, and laurer wex° for drede,°
Yet for hir love, O help now at this nede!
 
“Mercurie, for the love of Hierse° eke,
For which Pallas was with Aglauros° wrooth,°
Now help, and eek Diane, I thee biseke,°
That this viage° be not to thee looth.°
O fatal sustren,° which, er° any clooth°
Me shapen was,° my destenè° me sponne,°
So helpeth to this werk that is bigonne!”
 
Quod Pandarus, “Thou wrecched mouses herte,
Art thou agast° so that° she wol thee bite?
Why, don° this furred cloke upon thy sherte
And folowe me, for I wol han the wite;°
But bid,° and lat me go bifore a lite.”°
And with that word he gan undo a trappe,°
And Troilus he broughte in by the lappe.°
 
The sterne° wind so loude gan to route°
That no wight other noise mighte here;
And they that layen at the dore withoute,
Ful sikerly° they slepten alle yfere;°
And Pandarus, with a ful sobre chere,
Goth to the dore anon withouten lette,°
Theras° they laye, and softely it shette.°
 
And as he has come° ayeinward° prively,°
His nece awook, and asked “Who goth there?”
“My dere nece,” quod he, “it am° I;
Ne wondreth not,° ne have of it no fere”;°
And ner he com, and seide hir° in hir ere,
“No word, for love of God I yow biseche;
Lat no wight rise° and heren° of our speche.”
 
“What! which wey be ye comen,° benedicite?”°
Quod she, “And how thus unwist of hem° alle?”
“Here at this secre° trappe dore,” quod he.
Quod tho Criseyde, “Lat me som wight calle.”
“Ey! God forbede that it sholde falle,”°
Quod Pandarus, “That ye swich foly wroughte!°
They mighte deme° thing they nevere er° thoughte!
 
“It is nought good a sleping hound to wake,
Ne yeve a wight° a cause to devine;°
Your wommen slepen alle, I undertake,°
So that, for hem,° the hous men mighte mine;°
And slepen wolen° til the sonne shine.
And whan my tale ybrought° is to an ende,
Unwist,° right as I com,° so wol I wende.°
 
“Now nece min, ye shul wel understonde,”
Quod he, “so as ye wommen demen alle,°
That for to holde in love a man in honde,°
And him hir ‘leef ’° and ‘dere herte’ calle,
And maken him an howve° above a calle,°
I mene, as love an other in this while,°
She doth hirself a shame,° and him a gile.°
 
“Now wherby that° I telle yow al this?
Ye woot° yourself, as wel as any wight,
How that your love al fully graunted is
To Troilus, the worthieste knight,
Oon of this world,° and therto trouthe plight,°
That, but° it were on him along,° ye nolde
Him never falsen,° whil ye liven sholde.
 
“Now stant it thus,° that sith° I fro yow wente,°
This Troilus, right platly° for to seyn,
Is thurgh a goter,° by a privé wente,°
Into my chaumbre come° in al this rein,
Unwist of° every maner wight, certein,
Save° of myself, as wisly have I° joye,
And by that feith I shal° Priam of Troye!
 
“And he is come in swich peine and distresse
That, but° he be al fully wood° by this,
He sodeinly mot° falle into wodnesse,°
But if° God helpe;° and cause why° this is:
He seith him told is, of° a freend of his,
How that ye sholde love° oon° hatte° Horaste,
For sorwe of which this night shalt been° his laste.”
 
Criseyde, which that al this wonder herde,
Gan sodeinly aboute hir herte colde,°
And with a sik° she sorwfully answerde,
“Allas! I wende,° whoso° tales tolde,
My dere herte wolde me not holde°
So lightly° fals! allas! conceites° wronge,
What harm they doon, for now live I to longe!
 
“Horaste! allas! and falsen° Troilus?
I knowe him not, God help me so,” quod she;
“Allas! what wikked spirit tolde him thus?
Now certes, em, tomorwe, and° I him see,
I shal therof as ful excusen me°
As ever dide womman, if him like”;°
And with that word she gan ful sore sike.°
 
“O God!” quod she, “so° worldly selinesse,°
Which clerkes callen fals felicitee,
Ymedled° is with many a° bitternesse!
Ful anguisshous° than is, God woot,” quod she,
“Condicioun° of vein prosperitee;°
For either joyes comen nought yfere,°
Or elles no wight° hath hem alwey° here.
 
“O brotel° wele° of mannes joye unstable!
With what° wight° so thou be, or how° thou pleye,
Either he woot° that thou, joye, art muable,°
Or woot it not, it moot ben oon of tweie;°
Now if he woot it not, how may he seye
That he hath verray° joye and selinesse,
That is of° ignoraunce ay° in derknesse?
 
“Now if he woot that joye is transitorie,
As° every joye of worldly thing mot° flee,
Than every time he that hath in memorie,
The drede of lesing° maketh him that he
May in no parfit selinesse be.
And if to lese° his joye he set a mite,°
Than semeth it that joye is worth ful lite.°
 
“Wherfore I wol deffine° in this matere,
That trewely, for ought° I can espie,°
Ther is no verray wele° in this world here.
But O, thou wikked serpent Jalousie,
Thou misbeleved° and envious folie,°
Why hastow Troilus me mad untriste,°
That never yet agilte him,° that I wiste?”°
 
Quod Pandarus, “Thus fallen is this cas.”°
“Why, uncle min,” quod she, “who tolde him this?
Why doth my dere herte thus, allas?”
“Ye woot, ye° nece min,” quod he, “what is;
I hope al shal be wel that is amis.
For ye may quenche° al this, if that yow leste,°
And doth right so, for I holde° it the beste.”
 
“So shal I do tomorwe, ywis,” quod she,
“And God toforn°, so that it shal suffise.”
“To-morwe? allas, that were a fair,”° quod he,
“Nay, nay, it may not stonden° in this wise;°
For, nece min, thus writen clerkes wise,
That peril is with drecching° in ydrawe;°
Nay, swich abodes° been nought worth an hawe.°
 
“Nece, alle thing hath time,° I dar avowe;
For whan a chaumbre afir is, or an halle,
Wel more nede is,° it sodeinly rescowe°
Than to dispute, and axe amonges alle°
How is this candele in the straw yfalle?°
A! benedicite!° for al among that fare°
The harm is doon, and farewel feldefare!°
 
“And, nece min, ne take it not agreef,°
If that ye suffre him° al night in this wo,
God help me so, ye hadde him never leef,°
That dar I seyn, now there is but we two;
But wel I woot, that ye wol not do so;
Ye been to wis° to do so gret folie,°
To putte his lif al night in jupartie.”°
 
“Hadde I him never leef?° By God, I wene°
Ne hadde I never thing so leef,”° quod she.
“Now by my thrift,”° quod he, “that shal be sene;
For, sin ye make this ensample of me,
If I al night wolde him in sorwe see°
For al the tresour in the toun of Troye,
I bidde God, I nevere mote° have joye!
 
Now loke° thanne, if ye, that been his love,
Shul putte al night his lif in jupartie°
For thing of nought!° Now, by that God above,
Nought only this delay comth° of folie,
But of malice, if that° I shal nought lie.
What, platly,° and° ye suffre him in distresse,
Ye neither bountee doon ne gentilesse!”°
 
Quod tho Criseyde, “Wole° ye doon o thing,
And ye therwith shal stinte° al his disese;°
Have here, and bereth him° this blewe ringe,
For ther is nothing mighte him bettre plese,
Save° I myself, ne more° his herte apese;°
And sey° my dere herte, that his sorwe
Is causeles, that shal be seen tomorwe.”
 
“A ring?” quod he, “ye, hasel—wodes shaken!°
Ye, nece min, that ring moste han° a stoon
That mighte dede men alive maken;
And swich a ring, trowe° I that ye have noon.
Discrecioun out of your heed is goon;
That fele I now,” quod he, “and that is routhe;°
O time ylost,° wel maystow° cursen slouthe!°
 
“Wot ye not wel° that noble and heigh corage°
Ne sorweth not, ne stinteth° eek for lite?°
But if a fool were in a jalous rage,
I nolde° setten at° his sorwe a mite,°
But feffe° him with a fewe wordes white°
Another day, whan that I mighte him finde.
But this thing stont al in another kinde.°
 
“This° is so gentil° and so tendre of herte,
That with his deeth he wol his sorwes wreke;°
For trusteth wel, how sore° that him smerte,°
He wol to yow no jalous wordes speke.
And forthy,° nece, er that his herte breke,°
So spek yourself to him of this matere;
For with o word ye may his herte stere.°
 
“Now have I told what peril he is inne,
And his coming unwist of° every wight;
Ne,° pardee,° harm may ther be noon ne sinne;
I wol myself be with yow al this night.
Ye knowe eek how it is your owne knight,
And that, by right, ye moste upon him triste,°
And I al prest° to fecche him whan yow liste.”°
 
This accident° so pitous° was to here,
And eek so lik a sooth,° at prime face,°
And Troilus hir knight to hir so dere,
His privé° coming, and the siker° place,
That, though° that she dide him as thanne° a grace,°
Considered° alle thinges as they stode,
No wonder is, sin° she dide al for gode.
 
Criseyde answerde, “As wisly° God at reste
My sowle bringe, as me is for him wo!°
And em, ywis, fain° wolde I doon the beste,°
If that I hadde a grace° to do so.
But whether that ye dwelle° or for him go,
I am, til God me bettre minde sende,
At dulcarnon,° right at my wittes ende.”
 
Quod Pandarus, “Ye,° nece, wol ye here?
Dulcarnon° called is ‘fleminge of wrecches’;°
It semeth hard, for° wrecches wol not lere°
For verray slouthe° or othere wilful tecches;°
This seid° by hem that be not worth two fecches.°
But ye ben wis, and that we han on honde°
Nis neither hard, ne skilful° to withstonde.”
 
“Thanne, em,” quod she, “doth herof° as yow list;°
But er he come I wil up first arise;
And, for the love of God, sin al my trist°
Is on yow two, and ye ben bothe wise,
So wircheth° now in so discreet a wise,
That I honour may have, and he plesaunce;
For I am here al in your governaunce.”°
 
“That is wel seid,” quod he, “my nece dere,
Ther good thrift on° that wise gentil herte!
But liggeth° stille, and taketh° him right here,
It nedeth not° no ferther for him sterte;°
And ech of yow ese otheres sorwes smerte,°
For love of God; and, Venus, I thee herie;°
For sone hope I we shulle ben alle merie.”
 
This Troilus ful sone on knees him sette
Ful sobrely,° right by hir beddes heed,
And in his beste wise his lady grette;°
But Lord, so° she wex° sodeinliche reed!°
Ne, though° men sholden smiten of° hir heed,
She coude nought a word aright° out bringe
So sodeinly, for° his sodein cominge.
 
But Pandarus, that so wel coude fele°
In every thing, to pleye° anoon bigan,
And seide, “Nece, see how this lord can knele!
Now, for your trouthe,° seeth° this gentil man!”
And with that word he for a quisshen° ran,
And seide, “Kneleth now, whil that yow leste,°
Ther° God your hertes bringe sone° at reste!”
 
Can I not seyn,° for° she bad him not rise,
If sorwe it putte out of hir remembraunce,°
Or elles if she toke it in the wise°
Of duëtee,° as for° his observaunce;°
But wel finde I she dide him ° this plesaunce,°
That she him kiste, although she siked° sore;
And bad him sitte adoun withouten more.°
 
Quod Pandarus, “Now wol ye wel biginne;
Now doth him° sitte, gode nece dere,
Upon your beddes side al there withinne,°
That ech of yow the bet° may other here.”
And with that word he drow him° to the fere,°
And took a light, and fond his contenaunce°
As for to loke upon° an old romaunce.
 
Criseyde, that was Troilus° lady right,°
And cleer° stood on a ground of sikernesse,°
Al° thoughte she, hir servaunt and hir knight
Ne sholde° of right° non untrouthe° in hir gesse,
Yet nathelees,° considered° his distresse,
And that love is in cause° of swich folie,
Thus to him spak she of his jelousie:
 
“Lo, herte min, as wold the excellence
Of love, ayeins the which that° no man may,
Ne oughte eek goodly° maken resistence
And eek bicause I felte wel and say°
Your grete trouthe,° and servise every day,
And that your herte al min was, sooth to seyne,
This droof° me for to rewe upon° your peine.
 
“And your goodnesse have I founde alwey° yit,
Of whiche, my dere herte and al my° knight,
I thonke it° yow, as fer as I have wit,°
Al° can I nought° as muche as it were right;
And I, emforth° my conninge° and my might,
Have and ay shal, how sore° that me smerte,°
Ben to yow trewe and hool,° with al min herte;
 
“And dredelees,° that shal be founde at preve.°—
But, herte min, what al this is to seyne°
Shal wel be told, so that° ye noght yow greve,°
Though I to yow right on yourself compleine.°
For therwith mene I finally the peine,
That halt° your herte and min in hevinesse,
Fully to sleen, and every wrong redresse.
 
“My goode min,° not I forwhy° ne how
That jalousie, allas! that wikked wivere,°
Thus causelees is cropen° into yow;
The harm of which I wolde fain° delivere!°
Allas! that he, al hool, or of him slivere,°
Shuld have his refut° in so digne° a place,
Ther Jove° him sone out of your herte arace!°
 
“But O, thou Jove, O auctor° of nature,
Is this an honour to thy deitee,°
That folk ungiltif° suffren here injure,°
And who that giltif is, al quit° goth he?
O were it leful° for to pleine on° thee,
That undeserved° suffrest jalousie,
And that I wolde upon thee pleine and crie!°
 
“Eek al my wo is this, that folk now usen°
To seyn right thus, ‘Ye,° jalousie is love!’
And wolde a busshel venim° al excusen,
For that° o grein° of love is on it shove!°
But that wot° heighe God that sit° above,
If it be liker° love, or hate, or grame;°
And after° that, it oughte° bere his° name.
 
“But certein is, som maner jalousie
Is excusable more than som, ywis.°
As whan cause is,° and som swich fantasie°
With pietee° so wel repressed is,
That it unnethe° dooth or seith amis,
But goodly° drinketh up° al his distresse;
And that excuse I, for the gentilesse.°
 
“And som° so ful of furie is and despit,°
That it sourmounteth° his repressioun;
But herte min,° ye be not in that plit,°
That thanke I God, for which your passioun
I wol not calle it but° illusioun,
Of habundaunce° of love and bisy cure,°
That dooth° your herte this disese° endure.
 
“Of which I am right° sory, but not wrooth;
But, for my devoir° and your hertes reste,°
Wherso yow list, by ordal° or by ooth,°
By sort,° or in what wise° so yow leste,°
For love of God, lat preve it° for the beste!
And if that I be giltif,° do me deie,°
Allas! what mighte I more doon or seye?”
 
With that a fewe brighte teres newe
Out of hir eyen fille,° and thus she seide,
“Now God, thou wost, in thought ne dede untrewe°
To Troilus was never yet Criseyde.”
With that hir heed doun in the bed she leide,
And with the shete° it wreigh,° and sighed sore,
And held hir pees;° not o word spak she more.
 
But now help God to quenchen° al this sorwe,
So hope I that he shal, for he best may;
For I have seyn, of° a ful misty morwe°
Folwen ful ofte° a mery someres day;
And after winter folweth grene May.
Men seen alday,° and reden° eek in stories,
That after sharpe shoures° been victories.
 
This Troilus, whan he hir wordes herde,
Have ye no care,° him liste not to slepe;°
For it thoughte him° no° strokes of a yerde°
To here or seen Criseyde his lady wepe;
But wel he felte aboute his herte crepe,
For every teer which that Criseyde asterte,°
The crampe of deeth, to streine° him by the herte.
 
And in his minde he gan the time acurse°
That he cam there, and that that he was born;
For now is wikke° yturned into worse,
And al that labour he hath doon biforn,°
He wende° it lost, he thoughte he nas but lorn.°
“O Pandarus,” thoughte he, “allas! thy wile°
Serveth of nought, so weilawey the while!”°
 
And therwithal° he heng adoun the° heed,
And fil on knees,° and sorwfully he sighte;°
What mighte he seyn? he felte he nas but deed,°
For wrooth was she that° shulde his sorwes lighte.°
But nathelees, whan that he speken mighte,°
Than seide he thus, “God woot,° that of this game,
Whan al is wist,° than am I not to blame!”
 
Therwith the sorwe so his herte shette,°
That from his eyen° fil ther not a tere
And every spirit his vigour° inknette,°
So° they astoned° and oppressed were.
The feling of his sorwe, or of his fere,
Or of ought elles,° fled was out of towne;°
And doun he fel al sodeinly aswowne.°
 
This was no litel sorwe for to see;
But al was hust,° and Pandare up as faste,°
“O nece, pees,° or we be lost,” quod he,
Beth nought agast”;° but certein, at the laste,
For this or that,° he into bedde him caste,°
And seide, “O theef,° is this a mannes herte?”
And of he rente al° to his bare sherte;
 
And seide, “Nece, but° ye helpe us now,
Allas, your owne Troilus is lorn!”°
“Ywis, so wolde I, and I wiste° how,
Ful fain,”° quod she; “allas! that I was born!”
“Ye, nece, wol ye pullen out the thorn
That stiketh in° his herte?” quod Pandare;
“Sey ‘al foryeve,’° and stint° is al this fare!”°
 
“Ye, that to me,” quod she, “ful lever were°
Than al the good° the sonne aboute gooth”;°
And therwithal° she swoor him in his ere,
“Ywis,° my dere herte, I am nought wrooth,
Have here my trouthe° and many another ooth;
Now speek to me, for it am I, Criseyde!”
But al for nought; yet mighte he not abreide.°
 
Therwith his pous° and pawmes° of his hondes
They gan to frote,° and wete° his temples tweine,
And, to deliveren° him from bittre bondes,
She ofte him kiste; and, shortly for to seyne,
Him to revoken° she dide al hir peine.
And at the laste, he gan his breeth to drawe,
And of his swough° sone after that adawe,°
 
And gan bet° minde and reson to him take,
But wonder sore° he was abaist,° ywis.
And with a sik,° whan he gan bet awake,
He seide, “O mercy, God, what thing is this?”°
“Why do ye with yourselven° thus amis?”°
Quod tho Criseyde, “Is this a mannes game?°
What, Troilus! wol ye do thus, for shame?”
 
And therwithal hir arm over him she leide,°
And al foryaf,° and ofte time him keste.°
He thonked hir, and to hir spak, and seide
As fil to purpos for° his herte° reste.
And she to that answerde him as hir leste;°
And with hir goodly° wordes him disporte°
She gan, and ofte his sorwes to comforte.
 
Quod Pandarus, “For ought I can espyen,°
This light nor I ne serven here of nought;°
Light is not good for sike° folkes yën.°
But for the love of God, sin° ye be brought
In thus good plit,° lat now non° hevy thought
Ben hanginge in the hertes of yow tweie”:
And bar° the candel to the chimeneie.°
 
Sone after this, though it no nede were,°
Whan she swich othes as hir list devise°
Hadde of him take,° hir thoughte tho° no fere,°
Ne cause eek non,° to bidde him thennes rise.
Yet lesse thing than othes may suffise
In many a cas; for every wight,° I gesse,
That loveth wel meneth° but° gentilesse.
 
But in effect she wolde wite° anoon°
Of what man, and eek where, and also why
He jelous was, sin° ther was cause noon;
And eek the signe,° that he took it by,
She bad him that to telle hir bisily,°
Or elles, certein, she bar him on honde,°
That this was doon of malis, hir to fonde.°
 
Withouten more, shortly for to seyne,
He moste obeye unto his lady heste;°
And for the lasse harm, he moste feine.°
He seide hir, whan she was at swiche a feste°
She mighte on him han loked at the leste;°
Not I not° what, al dere ynough a risshe,°
As he that nedes moste° a cause fisshe.°
 
Criseyde answerde, “Swete,° al° were it so,
What harm was that, sin° I non ivel mene?
For, by that God that wroghte° us bothe two,
In alle thinge is min entente° clene.
Swich arguments ne been not worth a bene;°
Wol ye the childish jalous° contrefete?°
Now were it worthy° that ye were ybete.”°
 
Tho Troilus gan sorwfully to sike,°
Lest she be wrooth, him thoughte° his herte deide;
And seide, “Allas! upon my sorwes sike°
Have mercy, swete herte min, Criseyde!
And if that, in tho wordes that I seide,
Be any wrong, I wol no more trespace;°
Do what yow list, I am al in your grace.”°
 
Criseyde answerde, “Of gilt misericorde!°
That is to seyn, that I foryeve al this;
And evermore on this night yow recorde,°
And beth wel war ye do no more amis.”
“Nay, dere herte min,” quod he, “ywis.”°
“And now,” quod she, “that I have do yow smerte,°
Foryeve it me, min owene swete herte.”
 
This Troilus, with blisse of that supprised,°
Put al in Goddes hond, as he that° mente
No thing but wel; and, sodeinly avised,°
He hir in armes faste to him hente.°
And Pandarus, with a ful good entente,
Leide him° to slepe, and seide, “If ye ben wise,
Swowneth° not now, lest more folk arise.”°
 
What mighte or may the sely° larke seye,
Whan that the sparhauk° hath it in his foot?°
I can no more,° but of thise ilke tweie,°
To whom this tale sucre° be or soot,°
Though that I tarie° a yeer, somtime I moot,°
After min auctor, tellen hir gladnesse,
As wel as I have told hir hevinesse.
 
Criseyde, which that° felte hir thus ytake,°
As writen clerkes in hir bokes olde,
Right as an aspes leef° she gan to quake,
Whan she him felte hir in his armes folde.
But Troilus, al hool° of cares colde,°
Gan thanken tho the blisful goddes sevene;
Thus sondry° peines bringen folk to hevene.
 
This Troilus in armes gan hir streine,°
And seide, “O swete, as ever mote I goon,°
Now be ye caught, now is ther but° we tweine;°
Now yeldeth° yow, for other boot° is noon.”
To that Criseyde answerde thus anoon,°
“N’adde I er now,° my swete herte dere,
Ben yolde,° ywis, I were now not here!”°
 
O! sooth is seid,° that heled for to be
As of° a fevre or other greet siknesse,°
Men moste° drinke, as men may often see,
Ful bittre drink; and for to han gladnesse,
Men drinken ofte peine and greet distresse;
I mene it here, as for this aventure,°
That thorugh a peine hath founden al his° cure.
 
And now swetnesse semeth more sweet,
That° bitternesse assayed° was biforn;
For out of wo in° blisse now they flete.°
Non swich they felten, sith they were born;
Now is this bet,° than bothe two be lorn!°
For love of God, take every womman hede°
To werken° thus, if it comth to the nede.°
 
Criseyde, al quit° from every drede and tene,°
As she that° juste cause hadde him to triste,°
Made him swich feste,° it joye was to sene,
Whan she his trouthe° and clene° entente wiste.
And as aboute a tree, with many a twiste,°
Bitrent° and writh° the sote° wodebinde,°
Gan eche of hem in armes other° winde.
 
And as the newe abaisshed° nightingale,
That stinteth° first whan she biginneth singe,
Whan that she hereth any herde° tale,°
Or in the hegges any wight steringe,°
And after siker° dooth hir vois out ringe;
Right so Criseyde, whan hir drede stente,°
Opned hir herte, and tolde him hir entente.
 
And right as he° that seeth his deeth yshapen,°
And deye moot,° in ought that° he may gesse,°
And sodeinly rescous° doth him escapen,°
And from his deeth is brought in sikernesse,°
For al this world, in swich present gladnesse
Was Troilus, and hath his lady swete;
With worse hap° God lat us nevere mete!°
 
Hir armes smale,° hir streighte bak and softe,
Hir sides longe, fleshly,° smothe, and white
He gan to stroke, and good thrift bad° ful ofte
Hir snowish° throte, hir brestes rounde and lite;°
Thus in this hevene he gan him to delite,
And therwithal° a thousand time hir kiste;
That, what to done, for joye unnethe° he wiste.°
 
Than seide he thus, “O, Love,° O, Charitee,
Thy moder eek, Citherea° the swete,
After thyself next heried° be she,
Venus mene I, the welwilly° planete;
And next yow, Imenëus,° I thee grete;
For never man was to yow goddes holde°
As I, which ye han brought fro cares colde.
 
Benigne Love, thou holy bond of thinges,
Whoso wol° grace, and list thee nought honouren,°
Lo, his desir wol flee withouten winges.
For, noldestow° of bountee° hem socouren°
That° serven best and most alwey labouren,

But if° thy grace passed° our desertes.°
 
And for thou me, that coude leest deserve

And me bistowed in so heigh a place
That thilke boundes° may no blisse pace,°
I can° no more, but laude° and reverence
Be to thy bounte° and thin excellence!”
 
And therwithal Criseyde anoon he kiste,
Of which, certein, she felte no disese.°
And thus seide he, “Now wolde God° I wiste,°
Min herte swete, how I yow mighte plese!
What man,” quod he, “was ever thus at ese
As I, on whom the faireste and the beste
That ever I say,° deineth° hir herte reste.°
 
Here may men seen that mercy passeth° right;°
The experience of that is felt in me,
That am unworthy to° so swete a wight.°
But herte min, of your benignitee,°
So thinketh, though that I unworthy be,
Yet mot I nede° amenden° in som wise,
Right° thourgh the vertu of your heigh servise.°
 
And for the love of God, my lady dere,
Sin° God hath wrought me for° I shal yow serve,
As thus° I mene, that ye wol be my stere,°
To do me live,° if that yow liste,° or sterve,°
So techeth me how that I may deserve
Your thank,° so that I, thurgh min ignoraunce,
Ne do no thing that yow be displesaunce.°
 
For certes, fresshe° wommanliche wif,°
This dar I seyn, that trouthe° and diligence,
That shal ye finden in me al my lif,
Ny wol not,° certein, breken your defence;°
And if I do, present or in absence,
For love of God, lat slee me° with the dede,
If that it like° unto your womanhede.”°
 
“Ywis,” quod she, “min owne hertes list,°
My ground° of ese,° and al min herte dere,

But late us falle awey° fro this matere;°
For it suffiseth, this that seid is here.

Of hir delit, or joyes oon the leste°

But juggeth, ye that han ben at the feste,°

That al this thing but nice dremes° were;
For which ful ofte ech of hem seide, “O swete,

And, Lord! so° he gan goodly° on hir see,°
That never his look ne bleinte° from hir face,
And seide, “O dere herte, may it be
That it be sooth,° that ye ben in this place?”
“Ye, herte min, God thank I of his grace!”
Quod tho Criseyde, and therwithal° him kiste,

This Troilus ful ofte hir eyen° two

Therwith he gan hir faste° in armes take,
And wel° an hundred times gan he sike,°
Nought swiche sorwful sikes as men make

⇓Sone after this they spake of sondry° thinges,

But wel I woot° a broch,° gold and asure,°
In whiche a ruby set was lik° an herte,
⇑Criseyde him yaf,° and stak° it on his sherte.
 
Lord! trowe ye,° a coveitous,° a wrecche,

They wol sey “Yis,” but Lord! so that° they lie,

They callen love a woodnesse° or folie,
But it shal falle hem° as I shal yow rede;°

⇑Of° al that souneth into° gentilnesse.°
 
But whan the cok, comune° astrologer,

In armes streine,° and seide in this manere:—
 
“O cruel day,° accusour of the joye
That night and love han stole° and faste ywryen,°
Acursed be thy coming into Troye,
For every bore° hath oon of thy bright yën!°
Envious day, what list thee° so to spyen?
What hastow° lost, why sekestow° this place,
Ther God° thy light so quenche,° for his grace?
 
“Allas! what° han thise loveres thee agilt,°
Dispitous° day? thin be the pine° of helle!
For many a lovere hastow shent,° and wilt;°
Thy pouring° in wol nowher lete hem dwelle.
What proferestow° thy light here for to selle?
Go selle it hem° that smale seles° graven;°

⇓And eek the sonne Titan gan he chide,°
And seide, “O fool, wel may men thee dispise,
That hast the dawing° al night by thy side,
And suffrest hir° so sone up fro° thee rise,
For to disesen° loveres in this wise.
What! hold your° bed ther, thou, and eek thy morwe!
I bidde God, so° yeve° yow bothe sorwe!”
 
Therwith ful sore he sighte,° and thus he seide,
“My lady right,° and of my wele° or wo
The welle° and rote,° O goodly min, Criseyde,
And shal I rise, allas! and shal I go?
Now fele I that min herte moot atwo!°
For how sholde I my lif an houre save,
Sin° that with yow is al the lif I have?
 
“What shal I doon, for certes, I not° how,
Ne whanne, allas! I shal the time see,
That in this plit° I may be eft° with yow;
And of my lif, God woot, how that shal be,
Sin° that desir right now so biteth° me,
That I am deed anoon, but° I retourne.
⇑How sholde I longe, allas! fro yow sojourne?°
 
“But nathelees, min owen lady bright,

As ye in min, the which° thing, trewely,

Yet sholde I bet enduren al my peine.”
 
To that Criseyde answerde right anoon,°
And with a sik° she seide, “O herte dere,
The game,° ywis, so ferforth° now is goon,
That first shal Phebus° falle fro his spere,°
And every egle° been the dowves° fere,°

“Ye be so depe° inwith° min herte grave,°

“And that ye me wolde han as faste° in minde

And, if I wiste soothly° that to finde,°
God mighte not a point my joyes eche!°
But, herte min, withoute more speche,°

For I am thin, by God and by my trouthe!
 
“Beth glad forthy,° and live in sikernesse;°
Thus seide I never er this, ne shal to mo;°
And if to yow it were a gret gladnesse

As fain° wolde I as ye, it were so,

And him in armes took, and ofte keste.°
 
Agains° his wil, sin° it mot nedes be,°
This Troilus up roos, and faste him cledde,°
And in his armes took his lady free°
An hundred time, and on his wey him spedde,
And with swich wordes as his herte bledde,°
He seide, “Farewel, my dere herte swete,
Ther God° us graunte sounde° and sone to mete!”
 
To which no word for sorwe she answerde,
So sore gan his parting hir destreine;°
And Troilus unto his palais ferde,°
As woo bigon° as she was, sooth to seyne;
So hard him wrong° of sharp desir the peine
For to ben eft° there he was in plesaunce,
That it may never out of his remembraunce.°
 
Retorned to his real° palais, sone
He softe° into his bed gan for to slinke,°
To slepe longe, as he was wont to done,
But al for nought; he may wel ligge and winke,°
But sleep ne may° ther in his herte sinke;°
Thinking how she, for whom desir him brende,°
A thousandfold was worth more than he wende.°
 
And in his thought gan up and doun to winde°

Criseyde also, right in the same wise,°
Of Troilus gan in hir herte shette°

Thonking° Love he° so wel hir bisette;°
Desiring eft to have hir herte dere

⇓Pandare amorwe° which that comen was°

Seide, “Al this night so reined it, allas!

Al night,” quod he, “hath rein so do me wake,°
That som of us, I trowe, hir hedes ake.”°
 
And ner he com, and seid, “How stont it now°
This mery° morwe, nece, how can ye fare?”°
Criseyde answerd, “Never the bet for yow,°
Fox that ye been, God yeve° your herte care!°
God helpe me so, ye caused al this fare,°

O! whoso seeth° yow knoweth yow ful lite!”°
 
With that she gan hir face for to wrie°
With the shete,° and wex for shame al reed;°
And Pandarus gan under for to prie,°
And seide, “Nece, if that I shal ben deed,
Have here a swerd, and smiteth of° min heed.”
With that his arm al sodeinly he thriste°
Under hir nekke, and at the laste° hir kiste.
 
I passe al that which chargeth nought° to seye,
What! God° foryaf° his deeth,° and she also
Foryaf, and with hir uncle gan to pleye,
For other cause° was ther noon than so.
But of this thing° right to the effect° to go,
Whan time was, hom til° hir hous she wente,
⇑And Pandarus hath fully his entente.°
 
Now torne we ayein to Troilus,
That resteles° ful longe° abedde lay,
And prevely° sente after Pandarus,
To him to come in al the haste he may.
He com anoon,° nought ones seide he “Nay,”
And Troilus ful sobrely° he grette,°
And doun upon his beddes side him sette.
 
This Troilus, with al the affeccioun
Of frendes love that herte may devise,
To Pandarus on kneës fil adoun,
And er that° he wolde of the place° arise,
He gan him thonken in his beste wise;
A hondred sithe° he gan the time blesse,
That he was born to bringe him fro distresse.
 
He seide, “O frend, of frendes the alderbeste°
That ever was, the sothe for to telle,°
Thou hast in hevene ybrought° my soule at reste
Fro Flegiton,° the fery° flood of helle;
That, though I mighte a thousand times selle,°

Saw never yet, my lif° that dar I leye,°
So inly° fair and goodly as is she,
Whos I am al, and shal, til that I deie;
And, that I thus am hires, dar I seye,

Of love, and eek thy kinde bisinesse.°
 
Thus hastow° me no litel thing iyive,°
For which to thee obliged be for ay°

For elles deed° hadde I be many a day.”°
And with that word doun in his bed he lay,
And Pandarus ful sobrely° him herde
Til al was seid, and thanne he him answerde:
 
“My dere frend, if I have doon° for thee
In any cas,° God wot, it is me leef;°
And am as glad as man may of it be,
God help me so; but tak now not agreef°
That° I shal seyn, be war of this mischeef,°

That thou thyself ne cause it nought to misse.°
 
⇓For of fortunes sharp° adversitee

Be not to rakel,° though thou sitte warme,°
For if thou be, certein, it wol thee harme.
 
“Thou art at ese,° and hold thee wel therinne.°

For worldly joye halt not but by a wir;°
That preveth wel,° it brest° alday so ofte;
Forthy° nede is° to werke with it softe.”°
 
Quod Troilus, “I hope, and God toforn,°
My dere frend, that I shal so me bere,°
That in my gilt ther shal no thing be lorn,°
Ny nil not rakle° as for to greven here;°
It nedeth not this matere ofte stere;°
For wistestow° min herte wel, Pandare,
⇑God woot, of this thou woldest litel care.”°
 
Tho gan he telle him of his glade night.
And wherof° first his herte dredde,° and how,
And seide, “Freend, as I am trewe knight,
And by that feith I shal° to God and yow,

“I noot° myself not wisly° what it is;

Pandare answerde, and seide thus, that he
That ones° may in heven blisse be,
He feleth other weyes,° dar I leye,
Than thilke time he first herde of it seye.°
 
This is o word for al;° this Troilus
Was never ful to speke° of this matere,
And for to preisen unto Pandarus
The bountee° of his righte° lady dere,
And Pandarus to thanke and maken chere.°
This tale ay was span newe to biginne°

Sone after this, for that° fortune it wolde,°
Icomen was° the blisful time° swete,

Ther° he was erst,° Criseyde his lady mete;
For which he felte his herte in joye flete;°
And feithfully gan alle the goddes herie;°
And lat see now° if that he can be merie.
 
And holden° was the forme and al the wise,°
Of hir cominge, and eek of his also,
As it was erst, which nedeth nought° devise.°
But plainly° to the effect° right for to go,
In joye and seurte° Pandarus hem two
Abedde° broughte, whan hem bothe leste,°
And thus they ben in quiete and in reste.
 
Nought nedeth it to yow,° sin they ben met,°
To aske at me° if that they blithe° were;
For if it erst° was wel, tho° was it bet
A thousandfold, this nedeth not° enquere.
Agon° was every sorwe and every fere;
And bothe, ywis, they hadde, and so they wende,°
As muche joye as hert may comprehende.°
 
This is no litel thing of for to seye,
This passeth° every wit for to devise;
For eche of hem gan otheres° lust° obeye;
Felicitee, which that thise clerkes wise
Commenden° so, ne may not here suffise.°
This joye may not writen been with inke,
This passeth al that herte may bithinke.°
 
But cruel day, so welawey° the stounde!°
Gan for to aproche, as they by signes knewe,
For whiche hem thoughte felen° dethes°wounde;
So wo was hem,° that changen gan hir hewe,
And day they gonnen to dispise al newe,
Calling it traitour, envious, and worse,
And bitterly the dayes light they curse.
 
Quod Troilus, “Allas! now am I war

And seyn,° that “Thorugh thy medling is yblowe°

⇓For which he gan deliberen,° for the beste,°
That though the lordes wolde that she wente,°
He wolde late hem graunte what hem leste,°
And telle his lady first what that they mente.°
And whan that she had seid him hir entente,°
Therafter wolde he werken° also blive,°
Though al the world ayein° it wolde strive.
 
Ector, which that wel the Grekes herde,
For Antenor how they wolde han Criseyde,
Gan it withstonde,° and sobrely° answerde:—
“Sires, she nis no° prisoner,” he seide;
“I noot° on yow who that this charge° leide,

“That is so wis, and eek so bold baroun,°

For which delibered° was by parlement,
For° Antenor to yelden up Criseyde,
And it pronounced by the president,°
Altheigh that Ector “Nay” ful ofte preide.°
And finaly, what wight° that it withseide,°
It was for nought, it moste been,° and sholde;°
For substaunce° of the parlement it wolde.°
 
Departed out of parlement echone,°
This Troilus, withoute wordes mo,
Unto his chaumbre spedde him faste allone,
But if it were° a man° of his or two,
The whiche he bad° out faste for to go,
Bicause he wolde slepen,° as he seide,
And hastely upon his bed him leide.
 
And as in winter leves been biraft,°
Eche after other, til the tree be bare,
So that ther nis° but bark and braunche ylaft,°
Lith Troilus, biraft° of ech welfare,°
Ybounden° in the blake bark° of care,
Disposed wood° out of his wit to breide,°
So sore him sat° the chaunginge° of Criseyde.
 
He rist him° up, and every dore he shette°
And windowe eek, and tho this sorweful man
Upon his beddes side adoun him sette,°
Ful lik a deed° image pale and wan;°
And in his brest the heped° wo bigan
Outbreste,° and he to werken° in this wise
In his woodnesse, as I shal yow devise.
 
Right as the wilde bole° biginneth springe
Now here, now there, ydarted° to the herte,
And of° his deeth roreth° in compleininge,°
Right so gan he about the chaumbre sterte,°
Smiting° his brest ay with his fistes smerte;°
His heed to the wal, his body to the grounde
Ful ofte he swapte,° himselven to confounde.°
 
His eyen two, for pitee of° his herte,

“O deeth, allas! why niltow° do me deye?°
Acursed be the day which that° nature

But after, whan the furie and the rage
Which that his herte twiste° and faste threste,°
By lengthe of time somwhat gan asswage,°
Upon his bed he leide him doun to reste;
But tho bigonne his teres more outbreste,°
That wondir is, the body may suffise°
To half this wo, which that I yow devise.
 
Than seide he thus, “Fortune! allas the while!°
What° have I doon, what have I thus agilt?°

Pandare, which that in the parlement
Had herd what every lord and burgeis° seide,
And how ful graunted was, by oon assent,°
For Antenor to yelden so Criseyde,
Gan wel neigh wood° out of his wit to breide,°
So that, for wo, he niste° what he mente;°
But in a rees° to Troilus he wente.
 
A certein knight, that for the time kepte°
The chaumbre dore, undide it him anoon;°
And Pandare, that ful tendreliche wepte,
Into the derke chaumbre, as stille as stoon,
Toward the bed gan softely° to goon,
So confus, that he niste° what to seye;
For verray° wo his wit was neigh aweye.
 
And with his chere° and loking° al totorn,°

And on his pitous face he gan biholden;°
But Lord, so often gan his herte colden,°

That neither mighte o° word for sorwe seye.
 
But at the laste this woful Troilus,
Ney° deed for smert,° gan bresten° out to rore,
And with a sorwful noise he seide thus,
Among his sobbes and his sikes sore,°
“Lo! Pandare, I am deed, withouten more.°
Hastow nought herd at parlement,” he seide,
“For° Antenor how lost is my Criseyde?”
 
This Pandarus, ful deed° and pale of hewe,
Ful pitously answerde and seide, “Yis!

Thise wordes seide he for the nones° alle,
To helpe his freend, lest he for sorwe deide.
For doutelees, to doon his wo to falle,°

But Troilus, that neigh° for sorwe deide,
Tok litel hede° of al that ever he mente;°
Oon ere it herde, at other out it wente—
 
But at the laste he answerde and seid, “Freend,

This Troilus in teres gan distille,°
As licour° out of a lambek° ful faste;
And Pandarus gan holde his tunge stille,
And to the ground his eyen doun he caste.
But nathelees, thus thoughte he at the laste,
“What, parde,° rather than my felaw° deie,
Yet shal I somwhat° more unto him seye”:
 
And seide, “Freend, sin° thou hast swich distresse,

To this answerde him Troilus ful softe,°
And seide, “Parde,° leve° brother dere,
Al this have I myself yet thought ful ofte,
And more thing than thou devisest° here.
But why this thing is laft,° thou shalt wel here;
And whan thou me hast yeve an audience,°

“First, sin thou wost° this toun hath al this werre

“Yet drede I most hir herte to pertourbe°

Thus weping that° he coude never cesse,

Pandare answerde, “Freend, thou mayst, for me,°

“And though thy lady wolde a lite° hir greve,°

Why sholde than for ferd° thin herte quake?
Thenk eek how Paris hath, that is thy brother,

“Forthi° tak herte, and thenk, right as° a knight,

This Troilus gan with tho wordes quiken,°
And seide, “Freend, graunt mercy, ich assente;

Ne peine noon° ne may me so tormente,

“Forthi° ris up, as nought ne were,° anoon,

The swifte Fame, which that false thinges

Fro man to man, and made this tale al newe,°
How Calkas doughter, with hir brighte hewe,°

For, God it wot,° hir herte on other thing° is,
Although the body sat among hem there.
Hir advertence° is alwey° elleswhere;
For Troilus ful faste° hir soule soughte;
Withouten word, alwey on him she thoughte.
 
Thise wommen, that thus wenden° hir to plese,
Aboute nought° gonne alle hir tales spende;°

As she that,° al this mene while, brende°
Of other passioun than that they wende,°
So that she felte almost hir herte deie
For wo, and wery° of that companie.
 
For which no lenger mighte she restreine
Hir teres, so they gonnen up to welle,
That yeven° signes of the bitter peine
In whiche hir spirit was, and moste dwelle,°
Remembring hir, fro heven unto which helle
She fallen was, sith° she forgoth° the sighte
Of Troilus, and sorowfully she sighte.°
 
And thilke foles° sittinge hir aboute

Bicause that she sholde out of that route°
Departe, and never pleye° with hem more.
And they that hadde yknowen hir of yore°
Seye° hir so wepe, and thoughte it kindenesse,°
And eche of hem wepte eek for hir distresse;
 
And bisily they gonnen hir conforten
Of thing, God wot,° on which she litel thoughte;
And with hir tales wenden° hir disporten,°
And to be glad they often hir bisoughte.°
But swich an ese° therwith they hir wroughte
Right as° a man is esed° for to fele,°
For ache of heed,° to clawen° him on his hele!°
 
But after al this nice vanitee°
They took hir leve, and hoom they wenten alle.
Criseyde, ful of sorweful pitee,°
Into hir chaumbre up wente out of the halle,
And on hir bed she gan for deed° to falle,
In purpos° never thennes for to rise;
And thus she wroughte,° as I shal yow devise.°
 
Hir ounded° heer, that sonnish° was of hewe,
She rente,° and eek hir fingres longe and smale°
She wrong° ful ofte, and bad God on hir rewe,°
And with the deeth to doon bote on hir bale.°
Hir hewe, whilom bright, that tho was pale,
Bar° witnes of hir wo and hir constreinte;°
And thus she spak, sobbinge, in hir compleinte:°
 
“Alas!” quod she, “out of this regioun°

And born in corsed° constellacioun,°

Therwith the teres from hir eyen two
Doun fille,° as shour° in Aperill, ful swithe;°

She held hirself a forlost° creature.
 
⇓She seid, “How shal he doon, and Ich° also?

How sholde a fish withoute water dure?°
What is Criseyde worth, from° Troilus?
How sholde a plaunte or lives° creature

“I shal don thus, sin neither swerd ne darte°

Pandare, which that sent from Troilus
Was to Criseyde, as ye han herd devise,°
That for the beste it was accorded° thus,
And he ful glad to doon him that servise,
Unto Criseyde, in a ful secree wise,°
Theras she lay in torment and in rage,°
Com hir to telle al hoolly his message.
 
And fond° that she hirselven gan to trete°
Ful pitously; for with hir salte teres
Hir brest, hir face ybathed was ful wete;
The mighty° tresses of hir sonnish heres,°

Of deeth, which that hire herte gan desire.

For if Criseyde hadde erst° compleined sore,°
Tho gan she pleine° a thousand times more.
 
And in hir aspre° pleinte thus she seide,
“Pandare first of joyes mo than two

“And thou, my suster, ful of discomfort,”

Torned hir° tho Criseyde, a wo makinge°

“Allas!” quod she, “what wordes may ye bringe?

Aboute hir eyen two a purpre° ring
Bitrent,° in sothfast° tokninge° of hir peine,
That to biholde it was a dedly° thing,
For which Pandare mighte not restreine
The teres from his eyen for to reine.
But nathelees, as he best mighte, he seide
From Troilus thise wordes to Criseyde.
 
“Lo, nece, I trowe° ye han herd al how
The king, with othere lordes, for the beste,°

That cause is of this sorwe and this unreste.
But how this cas doth Troilus moleste,°

“For which we han so sorwed, he and I,

⇓This, short and pleine, th’effect of my message,
As ferforth° as my wit can comprehende.
For ye, that been of torment in swich rage,°
May to no long prologe as now° entende;°
And herupon° ye may answere him sende.
And, for the love of God, my nece dere,
⇑So leef° this wo er° Troilus be here.”
 
“Gret is my wo,” quod she, and sighte sore,°
As she that° feleth dedly sharp distresse;
“But yet to me his sorwe is muchel° more,
That love° him bet° than he himself, I gesse.
Allas! for me hath he swich hevinesse?
Can he for me so pitously compleine?
Ywis,° this sorwe doubleth al my peine.
 
“Grevous to me, God wot,° is for to twinne,”°
Quod she, “but yet it harder is to me
To seen that sorwe which that he is inne;
For wel wot I, it wol my bane° be;
And deie I wol in certain,”° tho quod she;
“But bidde him come, er deeth, that thus me threteth,°
Drive out that goost,° which in min herte beteth.”°
 
Thise wordes seid, she on hir armes two
Fil gruf,° and gan to wepe pitously.
Quod Pandarus, “Allas! why do ye so,
Sin° wel ye wot° the time is faste by,°
That he shal come? Aris up hastely,
That he yow nat biwopen° thus ne finde,
But° ye wol han him wood° out of his minde!
 
“For wiste he° that ye ferde° in this manere,

“Go,” quod Criseyde, “and uncle, trewely,

Him for to glade,° I shal don al my peine,°

Goth Pandarus, and Troilus he soughte,
Til in a temple he fond him allone,
As he that of his lif no lenger roughte;°
But to the pitouse goddes everichone°
Ful tendrely he preide, and made his mone,
To doon him° sone out of this world to pace;°
For wel he thought ther was non other grace.°
 
⇓And shortly, al the sothe° for to seye,
He was so fallen in despeir that day,
That outrely° he shoop him° for to deie.
For right thus was his argument alwey:
He seide, he nas but loren,° wailawey!°
“For al that comth,° comth by necessitee;
Thus to be lorn,° it is my destinee.
 
“For certainly, this wot I wel,” he seide,
“That forsight of divine purveiaunce°
Hath seyn alwey me to forgon° Criseyde,
Sin God seeth every thing, out of doutaunce,°
And hem desponeth,° thourgh his ordenaunce,°
In hir merites° sothly° for to be,
As they shul comen by predestinee.°
 
“But nathelees, allas! whom shal I leve?°
For ther ben grete clerkes° many oon,°

And som men seyn that nedely° ther is noon;°
But that free chois is yeven° us everichoon.°
O, welaway!° so sleie° arn clerkes olde,

“For som men seyn, if God seth° al biforn,°

Than moot it fallen,° though men hadde it sworn,°
That° purveiaunce° hath seyn bifore to be.
Wherfor I seye, that from eterne° if he
Hath wist° biforn° our thought eek as° our dede,
We have no free chois, as these clerkes rede.°
 
“For other thought nor other dede also
Might never be, but swich as purveiaunce,°
Which may not ben deceived never mo,°
Hath feled° biforn, withouten° ignoraunce.
For if ther mighte been a variaunce°
To writhen° out fro Goddes purveyinge,°
Ther nere no° prescience of thing cominge;
 
“But it were rather an opinioun
Uncertein, and no stedfast forseinge;°
And certes, that were° an abusioun,°
That God shuld han no parfit cleer witinge°

But swich an errour upon° God to gesse°
Were fals and foul, and wikked corsednesse.°
 
“Eek this is an opinioun of somme
That han hir top° ful heighe and smothe yshore;°
They seyn right thus, that thing is not to come
For that° the prescience° hath seyn bifore
That it° shal come; but they seyn, that therfore°
That it° shal come, therfore the purveiaunce°
Wot° it biforn withouten ignoraunce;
 
“And in this manere this necessitee
Retorneth° in his part° contrarie° again.
For needfully° bihoveth it not° to be
That thilke° thinges fallen° in certain°
That ben purveied;° but nedely,° as they seyn,
Bihoveth it° that thinges, whiche that falle,°
That they in certain ben purveyed alle.°
 
“I mene, as though I laboured me° in this,
To enqueren° which thing cause of which thing be;
As whether that the prescience of God is
The certain cause of the necessitee
Of thinges that to comen been,° pardee;
Or if necessitee of thing cominge
Be cause certein of the purveyinge.°
 
“But now ne enforce I me nat° in° shewinge
How the ordre of causes stant;° but wel wot° I,
That it bihoveth° that the bifallinge°
Of thinges wist° biforen° certeinly
Be necessarie, al seme it not therby°
That prescience° put falling° necessaire
To thing to come,° al falle it foule or faire.°
 
“For if ther sit a man yond° on a see,°
Than by necessitee bihoveth it°
That, certes, thin opinioun soth be,°
That wenest° or coniectest° that he sit;
And fertherover° now ayenward° yit,
Lo, right so it is of the part contrarie,°
As thus; (now herkne,° for I wol not tarie°):
 
“I sey, that if the opinioun of thee
Be sooth,° for that he sit, than seye I this,
That he mot° sitten by necessitee;
And thus necessitee in either° is.
For in him nede of sitting is,° ywis,°
And in thee nede of sooth;° and thus, forsothe,
Ther moot° necessitee ben in yow bothe.
 
“But thou mayst seyn, the man sit not therfore,°
That thin opinion of his sitting soth° is;
But rather, for° the man sit ther bifore,°
Therfore° is thin opinion sooth, ywis.
And I seye, though the cause of sooth° of this
Comth of° his sitting, yet necessitee
Is entrechaunged,° bothe in him and thee.
 
Thus in this same wise,° out of doutaunce,°
I may wel maken, as it semeth me,
My resoninge° of Goddes purveiaunce,°
And of the thinges that to comen be;
By whiche reson° men may wel ysee,
That thilke° thinges that in erthe falle,°
That by necessitee they comen alle.
 
“For although that, for thing shal come,° ywis,
Therfore is it purveied,° certainly,
Nat that it comth for° it purveied° is:
Yet nathelees, bihoveth it° nedfully,
That thing to come° be purveied,° trewely;
Or elles, thinges that purveied be,
That they bitiden° by necessitee.
 
“And this suffiseth right ynow,° certein,
For to destroye our free chois every del.°—
But now is this abusion° to seyn,
That fallinge° of the thinges temporel°
Is cause of Goddes prescience eternel.
Now trewely, that is a fals sentence,°
That thing to come shold cause his prescience.
 
“What mighte I wene,° and° I had swich a thought,
But that God purveith° thing° that is to come
For that° it is to come, and elles° nought?
So mighte I wene that thinges alle and some,°
That whilom° been bifalle° and overcome,°
Ben cause of thilke soverein° purveiaunce,°
That forwot° al withouten ignoraunce.
 
“And over al this,° yet seye I more herto,
That right° as whan I woot° ther is a thing,
Ywis, that thing mot° nedefully° be so;
Eek right so, whan I woot a thing coming,°
So mot it come; and thus the bifalling°
Of thinges that ben wist° bifore the tide,°
They mow° not been eschewed° on no side.”°
 
Than seide he thus, “Almighty Jove in trone,°
That wost of al this thing the soothfastnesse,°
Rewe° on my sorwe, or do me deye° sone,
Or bring Criseyde and me fro this distresse.”
And whil he was in al this hevinesse,
Disputing with himself in this matere,
Com Pandare in, and seide as ye may here.
 
“O mighty God,” quod Pandarus, “in trone,

“And yet this is a wonder° most of alle,

Min herte seith, ‘Certein, she shal not wende’;°
And forthi put thin herte a while in reste;°
⇑And hold° this purpos, for it is the beste.”
 
This Troilus answerde, and sighte sore,°
“Thou seyst right wel,° and I wil do right° so”;
And what him liste,° he seide unto it° more.
And whan that it was time for to go,
Ful prevely° himself, withouten mo,°
Unto hir com,° as he was wont° to done;
And how they wroughte,° I shal yow telle sone.
 
Soth is,° that whan they gonne first to mete,

That neither of hem other mighte grete,

The lasse wofulle° of hem bothe niste°

As I seide erst,° for wo and for sobbinge.
 
Tho woful teres that they leten falle
As bittre weren, out of teres kinde,°
For peine, as is ligne aloës° or galle.°
So bittre teres weep° nought, as I finde,
The woful Mirra through the bark and rinde.°
That in this world ther nis° so hard an herte,
That nolde han rewed° on hir peines smerte.
 
But whan hir° woful wery gostes° tweine
Retorned been theras° hem oughte dwelle,
And that somwhat to waiken° gan the peine°
By lengthe of pleinte,° and ebben° gan the welle
Of hire teres, and the herte unswelle,°
With broken vois, al hoors° forshright,° Criseyde
To Troilus thise ilke° wordes seide:
 
“O Jove, I deie, and mercy I beseche!°
Help, Troilus!” and therwithal° hir face
Upon his brest she leide, and loste speche;
Hir woful spirit from his° propre place,
Right with the word, alwey up point to pace.°
And thus she lith° with hewes pale and grene,
That whilom° fresh and fairest was to sene.
 
This Troilus, that on hir gan biholde,°
Clepinge° hir name (and she lay as for deed,°
Withoute answere, and felte hir limes° colde,
Hir eyen throwen° upward to° hir heed),
This sorwful man can now noon other reed,°
But ofte time hir colde mouth he kiste;
Wher° him was wo,° God and himself it wiste!°
 
He rist him up,° and long streight° he hir leide;
For signe of lif, for ought° he can or may,
Can he noon finde in nothing° on Criseyde,
For which his song ful ofte is “Weilaway!”
But whan he saugh that specheles she lay,
With sorwful vois, and herte of blisse al bare,°
He seide how she was fro this world yfare!°
 
So after that he longe hadde hir compleined,°
His hondes wrong,° and seid that° was to seye,
And with his teres salte hir brest bireined,°
He gan tho teris wipen of° ful dreie,°
And pitously gan for the soule preie,
And seide, “O Lord, that set art in thy trone,°
Rewe eek on° me, for I shal folwe hir sone!”
 
She cold was and withouten sentement,°
For aught he woot,° for breeth ne felte he noon;
And this was him° a preignant° argument
That she was forth out of this world agoon;°
And whan he seigh ther was non other woon,°
He gan hir limes° dresse° in swich manere
As men don hem that shul be leid on bere.°
 
And after this, with sterne and cruel herte,
His swerd anoon out of his shethe he twighte,°
Himself to sleen,° how sore that him smerte,°
So that his sowle hir sowle folwen mighte,
Theras° the doom° of Minos wolde it dighte;°
Sin love and cruel Fortune it ne wolde,°
That in this world he lenger liven sholde.
 
Than seide he thus, fulfild° of heigh desdain,°
“O cruel Jove, and thou, Fortune adverse,
This al and som,° that falsly have ye slain
Criseyde, and sin ye may do me no werse,
Fy on your might and werkes so diverse!°
Thus cowardly ye shul me never winne;°
Ther shal no deeth me fro my lady twinne.
 
“For I this world, sin ye han slain hir thus,
Wol lete,° and folwe hir spirit lowe or hie;°
Shal never lover seyn that Troilus
Dar not, for fere, with his lady die;
For certein, I wol bere° hir companie.
But sin ye wol not suffre° us liven° here,
Yet suffreth that our soules ben yfere.°
 
“And thou, citee, whiche that I leve in wo,

And Attropos, make redy thou my bere!°
And thou, Criseyde, o swete herte dere,
Receive now my spirit!” wolde he seye,°
With swerd at herte, al redy for to deie.
 
But as God wolde, of swough° therwith sh’abreide,°
And gan to sike, and “Troilus” she cride;
And he answerde, “Lady min Criseyde,
Live ye yet?” and leet his swerd doun glide.°
“Ye, herte min, that thanked be° Cupide!”
Quod she, and therwithal° she sore sighte;°
And he bigan to glade hir° as he mighte;
 
Took hir in armes two, and kiste hir ofte,
And hir to glade he dide al his entente;°
For which hir goost, that flikered° ay onlofte,°
Ayein° into hir herte al softe° wente
But at the laste, as that° hir eyen glente°
Aside, anoon she gan his swerd aspie,°
As it lay bare, and gan for fere° crie,
 
And asked him, why he it hadde out drawe?°
And Troilus anoon the cause hir tolde,
And how himself therwith he wolde have slawe.°
For which Criseyde upon him gan biholde,°
And gan him in hire armes faste° folde,

But torne° he moste, and it was eek° to done.°
 
And right with that was Antenor ycome
Out of the Grekes ost,° and every wight°
Was of it glad, and seide he was welcome.
And Troilus, al° nere° his herte light,°
He peined him° with al his fulle might°
Him to withholde of° wepinge at the leste,°
And Antenor he kiste, and made feste.°
 
And therwithal he moste his leve take,
And caste his eye upon° hir pitously,°
And neer° he rood, his cause for to make,°
To take hir by the honde al sobrely.°
And Lord! so she gan wepen tendrely!°
And he ful softe and sleighly° gan hir seie,°
“Now hold your day,° and dooth me not° to deie.”
 
With that his courser° torned he aboute°
With face pale, and unto Diomede
No word he spak, ne noon of al his route;°
Of which the sone of Tideus took hede,°
As he that coude° more than the crede°
In swich a craft, and by the reine hir hente;°
And Troilus to Troy homwarde he wente.
 
⇓This Diomede, that ladde hir by the bridel,
Whan that he saw the folk of Troye aweye,°
Thoughte, “Al my labour shal not been on idel,°
If that I may, for somwhat shal I seye.
For at the worste it may yet shorte° our weye.
I have herd seid, eek times twiës° twelve,
‘He is a fool that wol foryete himselve.’ ”°
 
But natheles this thoughte he wel ynough,
“That certainly I am aboute nought°
If that I speke of love, or make it tough;°
For douteles, if she have in hir thought
Him that I gesse, he may not been ybrought
So soon awey;° but I shal finde a mene,°
That she not wite° as yet shal what I mene.”°
 
This Diomede, as he that coude his good,°
Whan time was,° gan fallen forth in speche°
Of this and that, and axed why she stood
In swich disese,° and gan hir eek biseche,
That if that he encrese mighte or eche°
With any thing hir ese,° that she sholde
Comaunde it him, and seide he doon it wolde.°
 
For trewely he swoor hir,° as a knight,
That ther nas thing° with whiche he mighte hir plese,
That he nold° doon his peine° and al his might°
To doon it, for to doon hir herte an ese.°
And preyede hir, she wolde hir sorwe apese°
And seide, “Ywis,° we Grekes con have joye
To honouren yow, as wel as folk of Troye.”
 
He seide eek thus, “I woot, yow thinketh straunge,°
No wonder is, for it is to yow newe,
Th’aqueintaunce of these Troyanes to chaunge,°
For folk of Grece, that ye never knewe.
But wolde never God but if° as trewe
A Greek ye shulde among us alle finde
As any Troian is, and eek° as kinde.
 
“And by the cause° I swer yow right, lo, now,
To been your freend, and helply,° to my might,°
And for that° more acqueintaunce eek of yow
Have ich had than another straunger wight,°
So fro this forth° I pray yow, day and night,
Comaundeth me, how° sore° that me smerte,°
To doon al that may like unto° your herte;
 
“And that ye me wolde as your brother trete,
And taketh not my frendship in despit;°
And though your sorwes be for thinges grete,
Noot° I not why, but out of more respit,°
Min herte hath for to amende° it greet delit.
And if I may your harmes not redresse,°
I am right° sory for your hevinesse.
 
“And though ye Troians with us Grekes wrothe°

And, for the love of god, my lady free,°

For trewely, ther can no wight° yow serve,

“And nere it° that we been so neigh° the tente

Criseyde unto that purpos° lite° answerde,

That, in effect, she nought his tales° herde,
But here and there, now here a word or two.
Hir thoughte° hir sorwful herte brast atwo.

But natheles she thonked Diomede
Of al his travaile,° and his goode chere,°

She seide eek, she was fain° with him to mete,°
And stood forth mewet,° milde, and mansuete.°
But here I leve hir with hir fader dwelle,°
And forth° I wol of Troilus yow telle.
 
To Troye is come this woful Troilus,
In sorwe aboven° alle sorwes smerte,°
With felon° look, and face dispitous.°
Tho° sodeinly doun from his hors he sterte,°
And thorugh his paleis, with a swollen herte,
To chambre he wente; of nothing took he hede,°
Ne noon to him dar speke a word for drede.°
 
And there his sorwes that he spared° hadde
He yaf° an issue° large, and “Deeth!” he cride;
And in his throwes° frenetik and madde
He cursed Jove, Appollo, and eek Cupide,
He cursed Ceres, Bacus, and Cipride,°
His burthe,° himself, his fate, and eek nature,
And, save° his lady, every creature.
 
To bedde he goth, and weileth° there and torneth
In furie, as dooth he, Ixion, in helle;
And in this wise° he neigh° til day sojorneth.
But tho bigan his herte a lite° unswelle°
Thorugh teres which that gonnen up to welle;
And pitously he cride upon° Criseyde,
And to himself right thus° he spak, and seide:—
 
“Wher is min owene lady lief° and dere,
Wher is hir white brest, wher is it, where?
Wher ben hir armes and hir eyen° clere,°
That yesternight° this time with me were?
Now may I wepe allone many a tere,
And graspe° aboute I may, but in this place,
Save a pilowe, I finde nought t’enbrace.°
 
“How° shal I do? Whan shal she com ayein?°

As wolde God,° ich hadde as tho° be slein!
O herte min, Criseyde, O swete fo!

“How shulde I thus ten dayes ful endure,

How shal she doon eek,° sorwful creature?

Swich wo for me? O pitous,° pale, and grene°

And whan he fil in° any slomeringes,°
Anoon biginne he sholde° for to grone,

This Pandar, that of° al the day biforn

Although he on his heed° it hadde ysworn,°
For with the king Priam alday was he,
So that it lay not in his libertee°

To Troilus, whan that he for him sente.
 
For in his herte he coude wel devine,°
That Troilus al night for sorwe wook;°
And that he wolde telle him of his pine,°
This knew he wel ynough, withoute book.°
For which to chaumbre streight the wey he took,
And Troilus tho sobreliche° he grette,°
And on the bed ful sone he gan him sette.°
 
“My Pandarus,” quod Troilus, “the sorwe

“But whider is thy reed,”° quod Troilus,

“By God, my conseil is,” quod Pandarus,
“To ride and pleye us with king Sarpedoun.”
So longe of this they speken up and doun,
Til Troilus gan at the laste° assente
To rise, and forth to Sarpedoun they wente.
 
This Sarpedoun, as° he that honourable
Was ever° his live, and ful of heigh largesse,°
With al that mighte yserved been on table,

For ever in oon° his herte piëtous

On hir was ever al that his herte thoughte.
Now this, now that, so faste° imagininge,

Or for to here on instrumentz so pleye.
For she, that of his herte berth° the keye,

And seide, “Leve° brother Pandarus,

For Goddes love, lat us now sone at eve°

Therwith he caste on Pandarus his yë°
With chaunged face, and pitous° to biholde;
And whan he mighte his time aright° aspie,°
Ay as he rood,° to Pandarus he tolde

In whiche he whilom hadde al his plesaunce.°
“Lo, yond° saugh I min owene lady daunce;

Than thoughte he thus, “O blisful lord Cupide,

And after this he to the yates° wente
Theras° Criseyde out rood° a ful good paas,°
And up and doun ther made he many a wente,°
And to himself ful ofte he seide “Allas!
From hennes° rood my blisse and my solas!°
As wolde blisful God° now, for his joye,
I mighte hir seen ayein come into Troye.
 
“And to the yonder hille I gan hire gide°
Allas! and there I took of hir my leve!°
And yond° I saugh hir to hir fader ride,
For sorwe of which min herte shal tocleve.°
And hider° hoom I com° whan it was eve;
And here I dwelle outcast from alle joye,
And shal, til I may seen hir eft° in Troye.”
 
And of° himself imagined he ofte
To ben defet,° and pale, and waxen lesse°
Than he was wont,° and that men seide softe,
“What may it be? who can the sothe° gesse
Why Troilus hath al this hevinesse?”°
And al this nas but° his malencolie,
That he hadde of° himself swich fantasie.°
 
Another time imaginen he wolde
That every wight that wente by the weye°
Had of him routhe,° and that they seyen sholde,
“I am right sory Troilus wol deie.”
And thus he droof a day yet forth° or tweye.°
As ye have herd, swich lif right gan he lede,°
As he that stood bitwixen° hope and drede.°
 
For which him liked° in his songes shewe
Th’encheson° of his wo, as he best mighte,
And make a song of wordes but a fewe,
Somwhat his woful herte for to lighte.°
And whan he was from° every mannes sighte,
With softe vois he, of his lady dere,
That absent was, gan singe as ye may here.°

“O sterre,° of which I lost have al the light,
With herte soor° wel oughte I to bewaile,°
That ever derk in torment, night by night,
Toward my deeth with wind in stere° I saile;
For which the tenthe night if that I faile°
The giding° of thy bemes° brighte an houre,°
My ship and me Caribdis wol° devoure.”
 
This song when he thus songen hadde,° soone
He fil° ayein into his sikes° olde;
And every night, as was his wone° to done,
He stood the brighte moone to beholde,
And al his sorwe he to the moone tolde;
And seide, “Ywis, whan thou art horned newe,°
I shal be glad, if al the world be trewe!
 
I saugh thin hornes olde° eek by the morwe,°
Whan hennes rood° my righte° lady dere,
That cause is of my torment and my sorwe;
For whiche, O brighte Lucina the clere,
For love of God, ren° faste aboute thy spere!°
For whan thin hornes newe ginne° springe,°
Than shal she come, that may my blisse bringe!”
 
The day is more, and lenger every night,
Than they be wont° to be, him thoughte tho;°
And that the sonne wente his° course unright°
By lenger wey than it was wont to go;
And seide, “Ywis, me dredeth° ever mo,°
The sonnes sone, Pheton, be onlive,°
And that his fadres cart° amis° he drive.”
 
Upon the walles faste° eek wolde he walke,
And on the Grekes ost° he wolde see,°
And to himself right thus he wolde talke,
“Lo, yonder is min owene lady free,°
Or elles yonder, ther tho° tentes be!
And thennes° comth this eir,° that is so sote,°
That in my soule I fele it doth me bote.°
 
“And hardely° this wind, that more and more
Thus stoundemele° encreseth° in my face,
Is of my ladies depe sikes° sore.
I preve° it thus, for in non other place
Of al this toun, save onliche° in this space,
Fele I no wind that souneth° so lik peine;
It seith, ‘Allas! why twinned° be we tweine?’ ”°
 
This longe time he driveth forth° right° thus,
Til fully passed was the ninthe night;
And ay biside him was this Pandarus,
That bisily° dide alle his fulle might°
Him to comforte, and make his herte light;
Yevinge° him hope alwey, the tenthe morwe
That she shal come, and stinten° al his sorwe.
 
Upon that other side eek was Criseyde,
With wommen fewe, among the Grekes stronge;
For which ful ofte° a day “Allas!” she seide,
“That I was born! Wel may min herte longe
After° my deeth; for now live I to longe!
Allas! and I ne may it not amende;°
For now is wors than ever yet I wende.°
 
⇓“My fader nil for nothing° do me grace°
To goon ayein, for nought I can him queme;°
And if so be° that I my terme° passe,
My Troilus shal in his herte deme°
That I am fals, and so it may wel seme.
Thus shal I have unthank° on every side;°
That I was born, so weylawey° the tide!°
 
“And if that I me putte° in jupartie,°
To stele° awey by nighte, and it bifalle°
That I be caught, I shal be holde° a spie;
Or elles, lo, this drede I most of alle,
If in the hondes of som wrecche° I falle,
I am but lost,° al be° min herte trewe;
Now mighty God, thou on my sorwe rewe!”°
 
Ful pale ywaxen was° hir brighte face,
Hir limes lene,° as she that° al the day
Stood whan she dorste,° and loked on the place
Ther° she was born, and ther she dwelt hadde ay.°
And al the night wepinge, allas! she lay.
And thus despeired, out of alle cure,°
⇑She ladde° hir lif, this woful creature.
 
Ful ofte a day she sighte° eek for destresse,
And in° hirself she wente ay portrayinge°
Of Troilus the grete worthinesse,
And alle his goodly° wordes recordinge°
Sin first that day hir love bigan to springe.°
And thus she sette hir woful herte afire
Thorugh remembraunce° of that° she gan desire.
 
In al this world ther nis° so cruel herte
That hir had herd compleinen in hir sorwe,
That nolde han wopen° for hir peines smerte,°
So tendrely she weep, bothe eve and morwe.°
Hir neded° none teres° for to borwe.
And this was yet the worste of al hir peine:
Ther was no wight to whom she dorste° hir pleine.°
 
Ful rewfully° she loked upon Troye,
Biheld the toures heighe and eek the halles;
“Allas!” quod she, “the plesaunce° and the joye
The which that now al torned° into galle° is,

O Troilus, what dostow° now,” she seide;
“Lord! whether yet thou° thenke upon Criseyde?
 
“Allas! I ne had trowed on° your lore,°

On time ypassed,° wel remembred me;°

But futur time, er I was in the snare,°

“But natheles, bitide what bitide,°

“For whoso wole of every word take hede,

For that that som men blamen ever yit,
Lo, other maner folk commenden it.
And as for me, for al swich variaunce,

But God it wot,° er° fully monthes two,

For bothe Troilus and Troye toun

For she wol take a purpos° for t’abide.°
 
This Diomede, of whom yow telle I gan,°
Goth now, withinne himself ay arguinge
With al the sleighte° and al that ever he can,°
How he may best, with shortest taryinge,°
Into his net Criseydes herte bringe.
To this entente° he coude never fine;°
To fisshen hir,° he leide out hook and line.
 
But natheles, wel° in his herte he thoughte,
That she nas nat° withoute a love in Troye.
For never, sithen° he hir thennes° broughte,
Ne coude he seen° her laughe or make joye.
He nist° how best hir herte for t’acoie.°
“But for t’assaie,”° he seide, “it nought ne greveth;°
⇑For he that nought n’assaieth,° nought n’acheveth”°
 
Yet seide he to himself upon a° night,
“Now am I not a fool, that woot° wel how°
Hir wo for love is of° another wight,°
And hereupon° to goon° assaye hir° now?
I may wel wite,° it nil not° been my prow.°
For wise folk in bokes it expresse,
‘Men shal not wowe° a wight° in hevinesse.’
 
“But whoso° mighte winnen swich a flour
From him, for whom she morneth° night and day,
He mighte seyn,° he were a conquerour.”
And right anoon,° as he that bold was ay,
Thoughte in his herte, “Hap, how hap may,°
Al sholde I° deye, I wole hir herte seche;°
I shal no more lesen° but° my speche.”
 
⇓This Diomede, as bokes us declare,°
Was in his nedes° prest° and corageous;
With sterne vois and mighty limes° square,°
Hardy, testif,° strong, and chevalrous
Of dedes,° lik his fader Tideus.
And som men seyn, he was of tunge large;°
And heir he was of Calidoine and Arge.
 
Criseyde mene° was of hir stature,°
Therto° of shap,° of face, and eek of chere,°
Ther mighte been no fairer creature.
And ofte time this was hir manere,
To gon ytressed with hir heres clere°

Which with a threde of gold she wolde binde.°
 
And, save° hir browes joineden yfere,°

But for to speken of hir eyen° clere,
Lo, trewely, they writen° that hir syen,°
That Paradis stood formed° in hir yën.
And with hir riche beautee evermore
Strof° love in hir ay, which of hem was more.°
 
She sobre° was, eek simple, and wis° withal,
The beste ynorisshed° eek that mighte be,
And goodly° of hir speche in general,
Charitable,° estatliche,° lusty,° and free;°
Ne never mo ne lakkede hir° pitee;
Tendre-herted, slidinge of corage;°
But trewely, I can not telle hir age.
 
And Troilus wel waxen° was in highte,
And complet° formed by° proporcioun
So wel, that kinde° it not amenden mighte;°
Yong, fresshe,° strong, and hardy° as lioun;
Trewe as steel in ech° condicioun;°
On of the beste enteched° creature,
That is, or shal, whil that the world may dure.°
 
And certainly in storie° it is yfounde,°
That Troilus was never unto° no wight,°
As in his time, in no degree° secounde
In durring don° that longeth to° a knight.
Al° mighte a geaunt passen° him of might,°

But for to tellen forth of° Diomede:—
It fil° that after, on the tenthe day,
Sin that° Criseyde out of the citee yede,°
This Diomede, as fresshe as braunche in May,
Com° to the tente theras° Calkas lay,
And feined him° with Calkas han to done;°
But what he mente,° I shal yow telle sone.
 
Criseyde, at shorte wordes° for to telle,
Welcomed him, and doun by hir him sette;°
And he was ethe° ynough to maken dwelle.°
And after this, withouten longe lette,°
The spices° and the win men forth hem fette;°
And forth° they speke of this and that yfere,°
⇑As freendes doon, of which som shal ye here.
 
He gan first fallen of the werre in speche°
Bitwixe hem° and the folk of Troye toun;
And of th’assege° he gan hir eek biseche,°
To telle him what was hir opinioun.
Fro that demaunde° he so descendeth doun°
To asken hir, if that hir straunge thoughte°
The Grekes gise,° and werkes that they wroughte.°
 
And why hir fader tarieth° so longe
To wedden hir unto som worthy wight.
Criseyde, that was in hir peines stronge°
For love of Troilus, hir owene knight,
As ferforth° as she conning° hadde or might,°
Answerde him tho; but, as of his entente,
It semed not she wiste° what he mente.°
 
But natheles, this ilke° Diomede
Gan in himself assure,° and thus he seide,
“If ich aright° have taken of yow hede,°
Me thinketh° thus, O lady min, Criseyde,
That sin I first hond on your bridel° leide,
Whan ye out come of Troye by the morwe,°
Ne coude I never seen yow° but° in sorwe.
 
“Can I not seyn what may the cause be
But if° for love of som Troyan it were,
The which right sore° wolde athinken° me
That ye, for any wight that dwelleth there,
Sholden° spille a quarter of a tere,°
Or pitously° yourselven so bigile;°
For dredelees,° it is nought worth the while.
 
“The folk of Troye, as who seith,° alle and some°
In preson been, as ye yourselven see;
For thennes° shal not oon on live° come
For al the gold bitwixen° sonne and see.
Trusteth wel, and understondeth me,
Ther shal not oon to mercy goon on live,
Al were he° lord of worldes twyës° five!
 
“Swich wreche° on hem, for fecching° of Eleyne,
Ther shal be take,° er that we hennes° wende,°
That Manes, which that goddes ben of peine,
Shal been agast° that Grekes wol hem shende.°
And men shul drede,° unto the worldes ende,
From hennes forth to ravisshe° any quene,
So cruel shal our wreche° on hem be sene.
 
“And but if° Calkas lede° us with ambages,°
That is to seyn, with double wordes slie,°
Swich as men clepe° a word with two visages,°
Ye shul wel knowen that I nought ne lie,°
And al this thing right seen° it with your yë,
And that anoon;° ye nil not° trow° how sone;
Now taketh heed,° for it is for to done.
 
“What wene° ye your wise fader wolde
Han yeven° Antenor for yow anoon,
If he ne wiste° that the citee sholde
Destroyed been? Why, nay, so mote I goon!°
He knew ful wel ther shal not scapen° oon
That° Troyan is; and for the grete fere,°
He dorste not,° ye dwelte° lenger there.
 
“What wol ye more,° lufsom° lady dere?
Lat Troye and Troyan fro your herte pace!°
Drif° out that bittre hope, and make good chere,°
And clepe ayein° the beautee of your face,
That ye with salte teres so deface.
For Troye is brought in swich a jupartie,°
That, it to save, is now° no remedie.
 
“And thenketh wel, ye shal in Grekes° finde,

And bet° to serven yow wol doon his might.°
And if ye vouche sauf,° my lady bright,
I wol ben° he to serven yow myselve,
Ye, lever° than be lord of Greces twelve!”
 
And with that word he gan to waxen reed,°
And in his speche a litel wight° he quook,°
And caste° aside a litel wight° his heed,
And stinte° a while; and afterward awook,°
And sobreliche° on hir he threw° his look,
And seide, “I am, al be it yow° no joye,
As gentil man° as any wight in Troye.
 
“For if my fader Tideus,” he seide,
“Ylived hadde,° I hadde been,° er this,
Of Calidoine and Arge a king, Criseyde!
And so hope I that I shal° yet, ywis.
But he was slain, allas! the more harm is,°
Unhappily° at Thebes al to rathe,°
Polimites and many a man to scathe.°
 
“But herte min,° sin that I am your man,°
And been the ferste° of whom I seche grace,°
To serven you as hertely° as I can,
And ever shal, whil I to live have space,°
So, er that I departe out of this place,
Ye wol me graunte, that I may tomorwe,
At bettre leiser,° telle yow my sorwe.”
 
What° shold I telle his wordes that he seide?
He spak ynow,° for o° day at the meste;°
It preveth wel,° he spak so that Criseyde
Graunted, on the morwe, at his requeste,
For to speken with him at the leste,°
So that° he nolde° speke of swich matere;
And thus to him she seide, as ye may here:
 
As she that° hadde hir herte on Troilus
So faste, that ther may it noon arace;°
And straungely° she spak, and seide thus:
“O Diomede, I love that ilke place
Ther° I was born; and Joves, for his grace,
Delivere° it soone of al that doth it care!°
God, for thy might, so leve° it wel to fare!°
 
“That Grekes wolde hir wraththe° on Troye wreke,°
If that they mighte, I knowe it wel, ywis.
But it shal not bifallen° as ye speke;
And God toforn,° and ferther over this,°
I wot° my fader wis and redy° is;
And that he me hath bought,° as ye me tolde,
So dere,° I am the more unto him holde.°
 
“That Grekes been of heigh condicioun,°

As worthy folk withinne Troye toun,
As conning,° and as parfit° and as kinde,
As been bitwixen° Orcades° and Inde.°
And that ye coude wel your lady serve,
I trowe° eek wel, hir thank° for to deserve.
 
“But as to speke of love, ywis,” she seide,
“I hadde a lord, to whom I wedded was,
The whos min herte al was,° til that° he deide;
And other love, as help me now Pallas,
Ther in min herte nis,° ne° never was.
And that ye been of noble and heigh kinrede,°

“And that doth me to han° so gret a wonder,
That ye wol scornen° any womman so.
Eek, God wot,° love and I be fer asonder;°
I am disposed bet,° so mote I go,°

What I shal after doon,° I can not seye;
But trewely, as yet me list not pleye.°
 
“Min herte is now in tribulacioun,
And ye in armes bisy,° day by day.
Hereafter, whan ye wonnen° han the toun,
Paraunter,° thanne so it happen may,°
That whan I see that I never er say,°
Than wole I werke° that I never wroughte!°
This word to yow ynough suffisen oughte.°
 
⇓“Tomorwe eek wol I speken with yow fain,°

If that I sholde of any Greek han routhe,°

“I sey not therfore that I wol yow love,

And therwithal° she caste hir eyen° doun,
And gan to sike,° and seide, “O Troye toun,
Yet bidde I God,° in quiete and in reste

But in effect, and shortly for to seye,
This Diomede al freshly newe° ayeyn
Gan pressen on,° and faste° hir mercy preye;°
And after this, the sothe for to seyn,°
Hir glove he took, of which he was ful fain.°
And finally, whan it was waxen eve,°
And al was wel, he roos° and took his leve.
 
The brighte Venus folwede° and ay taughte°
The wey, ther° brode° Phebus doun alighte;°
And Cinthea° hir char hors° overraughte°
To whirle out of the Lion, if she mighte;
And Signifer° his candeles° sheweth° brighte,
Whan that Criseyde unto hir bedde wente
Inwith° hir fadres faire brighte° tente.
 
Retorning° in hir soule ay up and doun
The wordes of this sodein° Diomede,
His greet estat,° and peril° of the toun,
And that she was allone and hadde nede
Of freendes help; and thus bigan to brede°
The cause why, the sothe for to telle,°
That she tok fully purpos° for to dwelle.°
 
⇓The morwe com, and goostly° for to spek,
This Diomede is come unto Criseyde,
And shortly, lest that ye my tale breke,°
So wel he for himselve° spak and seide,
That alle hir sikes sore° adoun he leide.
And finally, the sothe for to seyne,
He refte° hir of the grete° of al hir peine.
 
And after this the story telleth us,
That she him yaf° the faire baye stede,°
The which° he ones° wan of° Troilus;
And eek a broche° (and that was litel nede°)
That Troilus was,° she yaf this Diomede.
And eek, the bet° from sorwe him to releve,
She made him were° a pencel of hir sleve.°
 
I finde eek in the stories elleswhere,
Whan through the body hurt was Diomede
Of° Troilus, tho° weep° she many a tere,°
Whan that she saugh his wide woundes blede;°
And that she took to kepen him good hede,°
And for to hele him of his sorwes smerte.°
Men seyn, I not,° that she yaf° him hir herte.
 
But trewely, the story telleth us,
Ther made never womman more wo
Than she, whan that she falsed° Troilus.
She seyde, “Allas! for now is clene ago°
My name of trouthe° in love, for evermo!
For I have falsed oon, the gentileste°
That ever was, and oon the worthieste!°
 
“Allas, of me, unto the worldes ende,
Shal neither been ywriten° nor ysonge°
No good word, for thise bokes wol me shende.°
O, rolled shal I been on many a tonge;
Throughout the world my belle shal be ronge;°
And wommen most wol hate me of alle.
Allas, that swich a cas me sholde falle!°
 
“They wol seyn,° in as muche as in me is,°
I have hem° don dishonour,° weylawey!
Al be I not the first that dide amis,°
What helpeth that to do° my blame awey?
But sin° I see there is no bettre way,
And that to late is now for me to rewe,°
To Diomede algate° I wol be trewe.
 
But Troilus, sin I no better may,°
And sin that thus departen° ye and I,
Yet preye I° God, so yeve yow right good day°
As for° the gentileste, trewely,
That ever I say,° to serven feithfully,
And best can ay his lady honour° kepe”:—
And with that word she brast anon to wepe.°
 
“And certes, yow ne haten shal I never,°
And freendes love, that shal ye han of me,
And my good word,° al sholde I° liven ever.
And, trewely, I wolde sory be
For to seen yow in adversitee.
And giltelees,° I woot wel, I yow leve;°
But al shal passe; and thus take I my leve.”
 
But trewely, how longe it was bitwene,
That° she forsook° him for this Diomede,
Ther is non auctor° telleth it, I wene.
Take every man now to his bokes hede;°
He shal no terme° finden, out of drede.°
For though that he bigan to wowe° hir sone,°
Er he hir wan,° yet was ther more to done.°
 
Ne me ne list° this sely° womman chide°
Ferther° than the story wol devise.°
Hir name, allas! is publisshed° so wide,
That for hir gilt it oughte ynow suffise.°
And if I mighte excuse hir any wise,°
For she so sory was for hir untrouthe,°
⇑Ywis, I wolde excuse hir yet for routhe.°
 
This Troilus, as I biforn° have told,
Thus driveth forth,° as wel as he hath might.°
But often was his herte hoot and cold,
And namely,° that ilke ninthe night,
Which on the morwe° she hadde him bihight°
To come ayein: God wot,° ful litel° reste
Hadde he that night; nothing to slepe him leste.
 
The laurer-crouned° Phebus, with his hete,°
Gan, in his course ay upward as he wente,
To warmen of the est see° the wawes wete;°
And Nisus° doughter song with fresh entente,°
Whan Troilus his Pandare after sente;°
And on the walles of the toun they pleide,°
To loke if they can seen ought° of Criseyde.
 
Til it was noon, they stoden° for to see
Who that ther come; and every maner wight,°
That cam fro fer,° they seiden it was she,
Til that they coude knowen° him aright.°
Now was his herte dul, now was it light;
And thus bijaped° stonden for to stare
Aboute nought,° this Troilus and Pandare.
 
To Pandarus this Troilus tho° seide,
“For ought I° wot, bifor noon, sikerly,°
Into this toun ne comth nought here° Criseyde.
She hath ynow to done,° hardily,°
To twinnen° from hir fader, so trowe° I;
Hir olde fader wol yet make hir dine
Er that° she go; God yeve his herte pine!”°
 
Pandare answerde, “It may wel be, certein;°
And forthi° lat us dine, I thee biseche;°
And after noon than mayst thou come ayein.”
And hoom they go, withoute more speche;
And come° ayein, but longe may they seche°
Er that° they finde that they after cape;°
Fortune hem bothe thenketh for to jape.°
 
Quod Troilus, “I see wel now, that she

That er° she come, it wol neigh even° be.
Com forth,° I wol unto the yate° go.
Thise porters° been unkonninge° ever mo;
And I wol doon hem holden up° the yate
As nought ne were,° although she come late.”
 
The day goth faste, and after that comth° eve,
And yet com nought to Troilus Criseyde.
He loketh forth° by hegge,° by tree, by greve,°
And fer° his heed over the wal he leide.°
And at the laste° he torned him, and seide,
“By God, I woot hir mening° now, Pandare!
Almost, ywis, al newe was my care.°
 
“Now douteles, this lady can hir good;°
I woot, she meneth° riden prively.°
I comende hir wisdom, by min hood!°
She wol not maken peple nicely°
Gaure on hir,° whan she comth; but softely°
By nighte into the toun she thenketh° ride.
And, dere brother, thenk not long t’abide.°
 
“We han nought elles° for to don, ywis.
And Pandarus, now woltow trowen me?°
Have here my trouthe,° I see hir! yond° she is.
Heve up° thin eyen,° man! maystow° not see?”
Pandare answerde, “Nay, so mote I thee!°
Al wrong, by God; what seystow,° man, wher art?°
That I see yond nis but° a fare-cart.”°
 
“Allas, thou seist right sooth,”° quod Troilus;
“But hardely,° it is not al for nought
That in min herte I now rejoise thus.
It is ayeins° som good I have a thought.°
Noot I not° how, but sin that I was wrought,°
Ne felte I swich a confort,° dar° I seye;
She comth tonight, my lif, that dorste I leye!”°
 
Pandare answerde, “It may be, wel ynough”;
And held with him of° al that ever he seide;
But in his herte he thoughte, and softe lough,°
And to himself ful sobrely° he seide:
“From haselwode, ther Joly Robin pleide,
Shal come al that that thou abidest° here;
Ye,° farewel al the snow of ferne yere!”°
 
The wardein° of the yates° gan to calle
The folk which that without° the yates were,
And bad hem driven° in hir bestes° alle,
Or al the night they moste bleven° there.
And fer within° the night, with many a tere,
This Troilus gan hoomward for to ride;
For wel he seeth it helpeth nought° t’abide.
 
But natheles, he gladded him° in this:
He thoughte he misacounted° hadde his day,
And seide, “I understonde have al amis.°
For thilke° night I last Criseyde say,
She seide, ‘I shal ben° here, if that I may,
Er that the mone,° O dere herte swete!
The Lion passe,° out of° this Ariete.’°
 
“For which she may yet holde al hir biheste.”°
And on the morwe unto the yate° he wente,
And up and down, by west and eek by este,
Upon the walles made he many a wente.°
But al for nought; his hope alwey him blente;°
For which at night, in sorwe and sikes° sore
He wente him hoom, withouten any more.°
 
His hope al clene° out of his herte fledde,
He nath° wheron° now lenger for to honge;°
But for the peine him thoughte his herte bledde,
So° were his throwes° sharpe and wonder° stronge.
For when he saugh that she abood° so longe,
He niste° what he juggen of it° mighte,
Sin she hath broken that she him bihighte.°
 
The thridde, ferthe, fifte, sixte day
After tho dayes ten, of which I tolde,
Bitwixen° hope and drede his herte lay,
Yet somwhat trustinge on hir hestes° olde.
But whan he saugh she nolde° hir terme° holde,
He can now seen non other remedie,
But for to shape him° sone° for to die.
 
Therwith° the wikked spirit, God us blesse,
Which that men clepeth° wode° Jalousie,
Gan in him crepe, in al this hevinesse;
For which, bicause he wolde° soone die,
He ne eet ne dronk,° for° his malencolie,
And eek from every companie he fledde;
This was the lif that al the time he ledde.
 
He so defet° was, that no maner man°
Unneth° him mighte knowe ther° he wente;
So was he lene,° and therto° pale and wan,°
And feble, that° he walketh by potente;°
And with his ire° he thus himselven shente.°
And whoso axed him wherof him smerte,°
He seide, his harm° was al aboute° his herte.
 
Priam ful ofte,° and eek his moder dere,
His bretheren and his sustren° gonne him freine°
Why he so sorwful was in al his chere,°
And what thing was the cause of al his peine.
But al for nought; he nolde° his cause pleine,°
But seide, he felte a grevous° maladie
Aboute his herte, and fain° he wolde die.
 
So on a day he leide him doun to slepe,
And so bifel° that in his sleep him thoughte,
That in a forest faste he welk° to wepe
For love of hir that him these peines wroughte;°
And up and doun as he the forest soughte,°
He mette° he saugh a boor° with tuskes grete,
That slepte ayein° the brighte sonnes hete.°
 
And by this boor, faste° in his armes folde,°
Lay kissing ay his lady bright Criseyde:
For sorwe of which, whan he it gan biholde,
And for despit,° out of his slepe he breide,°
And loude he cried on° Pandarus, and seide,
“O Pandarus, now knowe I crop and rote!°
I nam but° deed, ther nis non other bote!°
 
“My lady bright Criseyde hath me bitrayed,
In whom I trusted most of any wight,
She elleswhere hath now hir herte apaied;°
The blisful goddes, through hir grete might,°
Han in my dreem yshewed° it ful right.°
Thus in my dreem Criseyde I have biholde”°—
And al this thing to Pandarus he tolde.
 
“O my Criseyde, allas! what subtiltee,°
What newe lust,° what beaute, what science,°
What wratthe of juste cause° have ye to° me?
What gilt of me,° what fel° experience
Hath fro me raft,° allas! thin advertence?°
O trust, O feith, O depe asëuraunce,°
Who hath me reft° Criseyde, al my plesaunce?
 
Allas! why leet° I you from hennes° go,
For which wel neigh° out of my wit I breide?°
Who shal now trowe° on any othes° mo?°
God wot I wende,° O lady bright, Criseyde,
That every word was gospel° that ye seide!
But who may bet bigilen,° if him liste,°
Than he on whom men weneth° best to triste?
 
What shal I doon,° my Pandarus, allas!
I fele now so sharpe a newe peine,
Sin that ther is no remedie in this cas,°
That bet° were it I with min hondes tweine°
Myselven slow,° than alwey thus to pleine.°
For through my deeth my wo sholde han an ende,
Ther every day with lif myself I shende.”°
 
Pandare answerde and seide, “Allas the while°
That I was born; have I not seid er this,
That dremes many a maner man° bigile?°
And why? for° folk expounden° hem amis.°
How darstow° seyn that fals thy lady is,
For° any dreem, right for° thin owene drede?°
Lat be° this thought, thou canst no° dremes rede.°
 
Paraunter,° ther° thou dremest of this boor,
It may so be° that it may signifie
Hir fader, which that old is and eek hoor,°
Ayein° the sonne lith,° on point° to die,
And she for sorwe ginneth° wepe and crie,
And kisseth him, ther° he lith° on the grounde;
Thus shuldestow° thy dreem aright° expounde.”°
 
“How mighte I thanne do?”° quod Troilus,
“To knowe of° this, ye, were it never so lite?”°
“Now seystow wisly,”° quod this Pandarus,
“My reed° is this, sin thou canst wel endite,°
That hastely a lettre thou hir write,
Thorugh which thou shalt wel bringen it aboute,
To knowe a sooth° of that° thou art in doute.
 
“And see now why; for this I dar wel seyn,
That if so is° that she untrewe be,
I can not trow° that she wol write ayein.°
And if she write, thou shalt ful sone° see,
As whether° she hath any libertee
To come ayein, or elles in som clause,°
If she be let,° she wol assigne a cause.
 
“Thou hast not writen hir° sin that she wente,

Now write hir thanne, and thou shalt fele° sone

Acorded° been to this conclusioun,°
And that anoon, these ilke° lordes two;
And hastely sit° Troilus adoun,
And rolleth° in his herte to and fro,
How he may best discriven hir° his wo.
And to Criseyde, his owene lady dere,
He wroot right thus, and seide as ye may here.
 
“Right fresshe° flour, whos I have been and shal,

This lettre forth was sent unto Criseyde,
Of which hir answere in effect° was this;
Ful pitously° she wroot ayein, and seide,
That also sone° as that she might, ywis,°
She wolde come, and mende al that was mis.°
And finally she wroot and seide him thanne,
She wolde come, ye,° but she niste° whanne.
 
But in hir lettre made she swich festes,°
That wonder was,° and swereth she loveth him best,
Of which he fond but botmelees bihestes.°
But Troilus, thou mayst now, est or west,
Pipe in an ivy leef,° if that thee lest;°
Thus gooth° the world; God shilde° us fro mischaunce,°
And every wight that meneth trouthe° avaunce!°
 
Encresen° gan the wo fro day to night
Of Troilus, for taryinge of Criseyde;
And lessen° gan his hope and eek his might,°
For which al doun he in his bed him leide;
He ne eet,° ne dronk,° ne sleep, ne word he seide,
Imagininge ay that she was unkinde;°
For which wel neigh° he wex° out of his minde.
 
This dreem, of which I told have eek biforn,°
May never come out of his remembraunce;°
He thoughte ay wel he hadde his lady lorn,°
And that Joves, of his purveiaunce,°
Him shewed hadde in sleep the signifiaunce°
Of hir untrouthe° and his disaventure,°
And that the boor was shewed him in figure.°
 
⇓For which he for Sibille° his suster sente,
That called was Cassandre eek al aboute;°
And al his dreem he tolde hir er he stente,°
And hir bisoughte° assoilen him the doute°
Of° the stronge boor, with tuskes stoute;°
And finally, withinne a litel stounde,°
Cassandre him gan right thus° his dreem expounde.°
 
She gan first smile, and seide, “O brother dere,
If thou a sooth° of this desirest knowe,°
Thou most° a fewe of olde stories here,°
To purpos,° how that fortune overthrowe
Hath lordes olde; through which, withinne a throwe,°
Thou wel this boor shalt knowe, and of what kinde°
He comen is, as men in bokes finde.
 
“Diane, which that wrooth° was and in ire
For Grekes nolde° doon hir sacrifise,°

For with a boor° as greet as oxe in stalle

“To slee this boor was al the contree reised,°

A maide,° oon of this world the best ypreised;°
And Meleagre, lord of that contree,
He loved so this fresshe maiden free
That with his manhod,° er he wolde stente,°
This boor he slow,° and hir the heed he sente;
 
“Of which, as olde bokes tellen us,

And of° this lord descended Tideus
By ligne,° or elles olde bokes lie;
But how this Meleagre gan to die
Thorugh his moder,° wol I yow not telle,
For al to long it were for to dwelle.”°
 
She toldë eek how Tideus, er she stente,°
Unto the stronge citee of Thebes,
To cleime kingdom° of the citee, wente,
For his felawe, daun Polimites,°
Of which the brother, daun Ethiocles
Ful wrongfully of Thebes held the strengthe;°
This tolde she by proces,° al by lengthe.°
 
Associat profugum Tideo primus Polimitem;
Tidea legatum docet insidiasque secundus;

Quartus habet reges ineuntes prelia septem;
Mox furie Lenne quinto narratur et anguis;
Archimori bustum sexto ludique leguntur;
Dat Graios Thebes et vatem septimus umbris;
Octauo cecidit Tideus, spes, vita Pelasgis;
Ypomedon nono moritur cum Parthonopeo;
Fulmine percussus, decimo Capaneus superatur;
Vndecimo sese perimunt per vulnera fratres;
Argiuam flentem narrat duodenus et ignem.
 
[The first (book) joins exiled Tideus with Polynices;
the second describes Tideus, the ambassador, and
the ambush; the third sings of Haemon and the
prophets in hiding; the fourth describes the seven
kings going into combat; afterwards, in the fifth,
the furies of Lemnos are described; in the sixth the
cremation of Archemous and the games are read
about; the seventh consigns the Greeks to Thebes
and the prophet to the shadows; in the eighth,
Tideus, hope, life of the Pelasgians, fell; in the ninth
Ypomedon dies with Parthenopaeus; struck by
lightening, Capaneus is overcome in the tenth; in
the eleventh brothers annihilate each other with
wounds; in the twelfth describes weeping Argia and fire.]
 
She tolde eek how Hemonides° asterte,°
Whan Tideus slough fifty knightes stoute.°
She told eek al the prophesies by herte,
And how that seven kinges, with hir route,°
Bisegeden° the citee al aboute;
And of the holy serpent, and the welle,
And of the furies, al she gan him telle.
 
Of Archimoris buryinge° and the pleies,°
And how Amphiorax fil° through the grounde,
How Tideus was slain, lord of Argeies,°
And how Ypomedoun in litel stounde°
Was dreint,° and deed° Parthonope of wounde;°
And also how Cappanëus the proude
With thonder dint° was slain, that° cride° loude.
 
She gan eek telle him how that either brother,

At a scarmiche,° eche of hem slough other,°
And of Argives° wepinge and hir wo;
And how the town was brent° she tolde eek tho.
And so descendeth doun° from gestes olde°
To Diomede, and thus she spak and tolde.
 
“This ilke° boor bitokneth° Diomede,

Fro Meleagre, that made the boor to blede.°
And thy lady, wherso° she be, ywis,
This Diomede hir herte hath, and she his.
Weep if thou wolt, or leef;° for, out of doute,
This Diomede is inne, and thou art oute.”
 
“Thou seist nat sooth,”° quod he, “thou sorceresse,

“As wel thou mightest° lyen on° Alceste,

Cassandre goth,° and he with cruel° herte

And from his bed al sodeinly he sterte,°

And thus he dryeth forth° his aventure.°

Of° heighe Jove, as regnes° shal ben flitted°

Among al this, the fin° of the parodie°
Of Ector gan approchen wonder blive;°
The fate wolde his soule sholde unbodie,°
And shapen hadde a mene° it out to drive;
Ayeins which fate him helpeth not° to strive;
But on a day to fighten gan he wende,°
At which, allas! he caughte° his lives ende.
 
For which me thinketh° every maner° wight

The deeth of him that was so noble a knight;
For as he drough° a king by th’aventaile,°
Unwar° of this, Achilles through the maile°
And through the body gan him for to rive;°
And thus this worthy knight was brought of live.°
 
For whom, as olde bokes tellen us,
Was mad swich wo, that tonge it may not telle;
And namely,° the sorwe of Troilus,
That next him° was of worthinesse welle.°
And in this wo gan Troilus to dwelle,°
That, what for sorwe, and love, and for unreste,°
Ful ofte a day° he bad° his herte breste.°
 
But natheles,° though he gan him dispeire,°
And dradde° ay that his lady was untrewe,°
Yet ay on° hir his herte gan repeire.°
And as these loveres doon, he soughte ay newe°
To gete ayein° Criseyde, bright of hewe.
And in his herte he wente° hir excusinge,
That Calkas causede al hir taryinge.°
 
And ofte time he was in purpos grete°
Himselven lik a pilgrim to disgise,
To seen hir; but he may not contrefete°
To been unknowen of° folk that weren wise,
Ne finde excuse aright° that may suffise,
If he among the Grekes knowen° were;
For which he weep ful ofte many a tere.
 
⇓To hir he wroot yet ofte time al newe°
Ful pitously,° he lefte it nought° for slouthe,°
Biseching° hir that, sin° that he was trewe,

For which Criseyde upon a day, for routhe,°

Wrot him ayein,° and seide as ye may here.°

This Troilus, and in suspecioun°
Of hir for whom he wende for to die.°
And so bifel,° that throughout Troye toun,
As was the gise,° ybore° was up and doun
A maner° cote armure,° as seith the storie,
Biforn° Deiphebe, in signe of his victorie,
 
The whiche° cote, as telleth Lollius,
Deiphebe it hadde yrent° from Diomede
The same day; and whan this Troilus
It saugh, he gan to taken of it hede,°
Avising° of the lengthe and of the brede,°
And al the werk;° but as he gan biholde,
Ful sodeinly his herte gan to colde,°
 
As he that° on the coler fond° withinne°
A broche,° that he Criseyde yaf° that morwe°
That she from Troye moste nedes twinne,°
In remembraunce of him and of his sorwe;
And she him leide ayein hir feith to borwe°
To kepe it ay;° but now, ful wel he wiste,°
His lady nas° no lenger on to triste.°
 
He gooth him hoom, and gan ful soone° sende
For Pandarus; and al this newe chaunce,°
And of this broche, he tolde him word and ende,°
Compleininge of hir hertes variaunce,°
His longe love, his trouthe,° and his penaunce;°
And after° deeth, withouten wordes more,
Ful faste he cride,° his reste him to restore.
 
Than spak he thus, “O lady min Criseyde,
Wher is your feith,° and wher is your biheste?°
Wher is your love, wher is your trouthe,”° he seide;
“Of Diomede have ye now al this feste!°
Allas, I wolde have trowed° at the leste,°
That, sin ye nolde° in trouthe° to me stonde,°
That ye thus nolde han holden me in honde!°
 
“Who shal now trowe° on any othes° mo?°
Allas, I never wolde han wend,° er this,
That ye, Criseyde, coude han chaunged so;
Ne, but° I hadde agilt° and doon amis,
So cruel wende° I not your herte, ywis,
To slee me thus; allas, your name of trouthe°
Is now fordoon,° and that is al my routhe.°
 
“Was ther non other broche yow liste lete°
To feffe with° your newe love,” quod he,
“But thilke° broche that I, with teres wete,°
Yow yaf,° as for a° remembraunce of me?
Non other cause, allas, ne hadde ye
But for° despit,° and eek for that° ye mente
Al outrely° to shewen your entente!
 
“Through which I see that clene° out of your minde
Ye han me cast, and I ne can° nor may,
For al this world, within min herte finde
To unloven° yow a quarter of a day!
In cursed time I born was, weylaway!
That ye, that doon me al this wo endure,
Yet° love I best of any creature.
 
“Now God,” quod he, “me sende yet the grace°
That I may meten with this Diomede!
And trewely, if I have might° and space,°
Yet shal I make, I hope, his sides blede.
O God,” quod he, “that oughtest taken hede°
To fortheren° trouthe, and wronges to punice,°
Why niltow° doon a vengeaunce on this vice?°
 
“O Pandare, that in dremes for to triste°
Me blamed hast,° and wont art° ofte upbreide,°
Now maystow° see thyselve, if that thee liste,°
How trewe is now thy nece, bright° Criseyde!
In sondry formes,° God it woot,”° he seide,
“The goddes shewen° bothe joye and tene°
In slepe, and by my dreme it is now sene.
 
“And certainly, withoute more speche,
From hennesforth, as ferforth° as I may,
Min owene deeth in armes wol I seche;°
I recche° not how soone be the day!
But trewely, Criseyde, swete may,°
Whom I have ay with al my might yserved,
That ye thus doon,° I have it nought deserved.”
 
This Pandarus, that al these thinges herde,°
And wiste° wel he seide a sooth of° this,
He nought a word ayein° to him answerde;
For sory of his frendes sorwe he is,
And shamed,° for his nece hath doon amis;°
And stant,° astoned of° these causes tweye,
As stille as stoon; a word ne coude he seye.
 
But at the laste thus he spak, and seide,
“My brother dere, I may thee° do no more.
What shulde° I seyn? I hate, ywis,° Criseyde!
And God wot,° I wol hate hir evermore!
And that° thou me bisoughtest doon° of yore,°
Havinge unto min honour ne my reste°
Right no reward,° I dide al that thee leste.°
 
If I dide ought° that mighte liken thee,°
It is me leef;° and of this treson now,
God woot, that it a sorwe is unto me!
And dredelees,° for hertes ese° of yow,
Right fain° wolde I amende it, wiste I how.°
And fro this world, almighty God I preye,
Delivere° hir soon; I can no more seye.”
 
Gret was the sorwe and pleint° of Troilus;
But forth hir cours° fortune ay gan to holde.°
Criseyde loveth the sone of Tideus,
And Troilus mot° wepe in cares colde.
Swich is this world; whoso it can biholde,
In eche estat° is litel hertes reste;
God leve us° for to take it for the beste!
 
In many cruel bataile, out of drede,°
Of Troilus, this ilke° noble knight,
As men may in these olde bokes rede,°
Was sene his knighthod and his grete might.°
And dredelees,° his ire, day and night,
Ful cruelly the Grekes ay aboughte;°
And alwey most this Diomede he soughte.
 
And ofte time, I finde° that they mette
With blody strokes and with wordes grete,°
Assayinge° how hir speres weren whette;°
And God it woot,° with many a cruel hete°
Gan Troilus upon his helm to bete.
But natheles, fortune it nought ne wolde,°
Of otheres° hond that either deyen sholde.—
 
⇓And if I hadde ytaken° for to write
The armes° of this ilke worthy man,
Than wolde I of his batailles endite.°
But for that I to write first bigan
Of his love, I have seid as that I can.°
His worthy dedes, whoso list hem here,°
Reed Dares,° he can telle hem alle yfere.°
 
Bisechinge every lady bright of hewe,
And every gentil womman, what she be,°
That al be that° Criseyde was untrewe,
That for that gilt she be not wrooth with me.
Ye may hir gilt in othere bokes see;
And gladlier° I wol writen, if yow leste,°
Penelopeës trouthe° and good Alceste.
 
Ny sey not° this al only for° these men,
But most° for wommen that° bitraised be°
Through false° folk; God yeve° hem sorwe, amen!
That° with hir grete wit° and subtiltee°
Bitraise° yow! and this commeveth° me
To speke, and in effect° yow alle I preye,
Beth war° of men, and herkeneth what° I seye!—
 
Go litel book, my litel tragedie,
Ther God° thy maker° yet, er that he die,
So sende might to make° som comedie!
But litel book, no making thou n’envie,°
But subgit° be to alle poesie;°
And kis the steppes,° wheras° thou seest pace°
Virgile, Ovide, Omer,° Lucan, and Stace.°
 
And for ther is so greet diversitee°
In English and in writing of our tonge,°
So preye I God that noon miswrite° thee,
Ne thee mismetre° for defaute of tonge.°
And red° wherso° thou be, or elles songe,°
That thou be understond° God I beseche!
⇑But yet to purpos° of my rather° speche.—
 
The wraththe,° as I began yow for to seye,
Of Troilus, the Grekes boughten dere;°
For thousandes his hondes maden deie,°
As he that was withouten any pere,°
Save Ector, in his time, as I can here.°
But weilaway,° save° only Goddes wille,
Dispitously° him slough° the fiers Achille.
 
⇓And whan that he was slain in this manere,
His lighte goost° ful blisfully is went
Up to the holownesse° of the seventh spere,°
In convers° letinge° every element;
And ther he saugh, with ful avisement,°
The erratik° sterres, herkeninge° armonie°
With sownes° fulle of hevenish° melodie.
 
And doun from thennes° faste° he gan avise°
This litel spot of erthe, that with the see°
Enbraced is, and fully gan despise
This wrecched world, and held al° vanitee
To respect of° the plein felicitee°
That is in hevene above; and at the laste,
Ther° he was slain, his loking° doun he caste;°
 
And in himself he lough° right at the wo
Of hem that wepten for his deeth so faste;°
And dampned° al our werk° that folweth so°
The blinde lust,° the which that° may not laste,
And sholden° al our herte on heven caste.°
And forth he wente, shortly for to telle,
⇑Ther as° Mercurie sorted° him to dwelle.°—
 
Swich fin° hath, lo, this Troilus for love,
Swich fin hath al his grete worthinesse;
Swich fin hath his estat real° above,
Swich fin his lust,° swich fin hath his noblesse;°
Swich fin hath false° worldes brotelnesse.°
And thus bigan his lovinge of Criseyde,
As I have told, and in this wise° he deide.
 
O yonge fresshe° folkes, he or she,
In which that° love up groweth° with° your age,
⇓Repeireth° hoom from worldly vanitee,°
And of your herte° upcasteth° the visage°
To thilke° God that after his image
Yow made, and thinketh al nis but° a faire°
This world, that passeth soone° as floures faire.°
 
And loveth him, the which that right° for love
Upon a cros,° our soules for to beye,°
First starf,° and roos,° and sit° in hevene above;
For he nil° falsen° no wight, dar I seye,
That° wol his herte al hoolly° on him leie.°
And sin he best to love is, and most meke,
What nedeth° feined° loves for to seke?°
 
Lo° here, of payens° corsed° olde rites,
Lo here, what° alle hir goddes may availle;°
Lo here, these wrecched worldes° appetites;
Lo here, the fin° and guerdon° for travaille°
Of Jove, Appollo, of Mars, of swich rascaille!°
Lo here, the forme of olde clerkes° speche
In poetrie, if ye hir bokes seche.°—

O moral Gower, this book I directe°

And to that sothfast° Crist, that starf° on rode,°
With al min herte of° mercy ever I preye;
