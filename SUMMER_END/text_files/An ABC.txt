Almihty and al merciable° queene,
To whom that al° this world fleeth° for socour,
To have relees of sinne of sorwe° and tene,°
Glorious virgine, of alle floures° flour,°
To thee I flee, confounded° in errour!
Help and releve,° thou mihti debonaire,°
Have mercy on my perilous langour!°
Venquisshed° me hath my cruel adversaire.°
 
Bountee° so fix° hath in thin herte his tente,°
That wel I wot° thou wolt my socour° be,
Thou canst not warne° him that, with good entente,°
Axeth° thin help. Thin herte is ay so free,°
Thou art largesse° of plein felicitee,°
Haven of refut,° quiete, and of reste,
Lo, how that theves° seven chasen me!
Help, lady briht, er that° my ship tobreste!°
 
Comfort is noon,° but° in yow, lady dere,
For lo,° my sinne and my confusioun,°
Which ouhten° not in thy presence appere,
Han take on° me a grevous accioun°
Of verrey° riht° and desperacioun;°
And, as by riht,° they mihten wel sustene°
That I were wurthy my dampnacioun,
Nere° mercy of you, blisful heven° quene.
 
Doute is ther noon, queen of misericorde,°
That thou nart° cause of grace and mercy here;
God vouched saf° thurgh thee with us t’acorde.°
For certes,° Cristes blisful moder dere,
Were now the bowe bent in swich manere,°
As it was first, of justice and of° ire,°
The rightful God nolde° of° no mercy here;°
But thurgh thee han° we grace,° as we desire.
 
Ever hath min hope of refut° been in thee,
For heerbiforn° ful ofte,° in many a wise,°
Hast thou to misericorde resceived me.
But mercy, lady, at the grete assise,°
Whan we shul com bifore the high justise!°
So litel fruit° shal thanne in me be founde,
That, but° thou er° that day me wel chastise,°
Of verrey riht° my werk° me wol confounde.°
 
Fleeing, I flee for socour° to thy tente°
Me for to hide from tempest ful of drede,°
Biseching° you that ye you not absente,°
Though I be wikke.° O help yit° at this nede!
Al have I° been a beste° in wil and dede,
Yit, lady, thou me clothe with thy grace.
Thin enemy and min—lady, tak hede,°
Unto my deth in point° is me to chace.°
 
Glorious maide and moder, which that° nevere
Were bitter, nor° in erthe nor in see,
But ful of swetnesse and of mercy ever,
Help that my fader° be not wroth° with me!
Spek thou, for I ne dar° him not ysee.°
So° have I doon in erthe, allas therwhile!°
That certes,° but if° thou my socour° be,
To stink° eterne° he wol my gost° exile.
 
He vouched saf,° tel him,° as was his wille,
Become a man, to have our alliaunce,°
And with his precious blood he wrot° the bille°
Upon the crois, as general acquitaunce,°
To every penitent in ful° criaunce;°
And therfor,° lady briht,° thou for us praye.
Than shalt thou bothe stinte° al his° grevaunce,°
And make our foo to failen of° his praye.°
 
I wot° it wel, thou wolt ben° our socour,°
Thou art so ful of bountee,° in certein.°
For, whan a soule falleth in errour,
Thy pitee goth and haleth him° ayein.°
Than makest thou his pees with his soverein,°
And bringest him out of the crooked strete.°
Whoso° thee loveth he shal not love in vein,
That shal he finde,° as° he the lif shal lete.°
 
Kalenderes° enlumined° ben they
That in this world ben lighted with° thy name,
And whoso° goth to you the rihte wey,
Him thar not° drede° in° soule to be lame.°
Now, queen of comfort, sith° thou art that same
To whom I seche° for my medicine,
Lat not my foo no more my wounde entame,°
Min hele° into thin hand al I resine.°
 
Lady, thy sorwe° can I not portreye
Under° the cros, ne his grevous° penaunce.°
But, for your bothes peines,° I you preye,
Lat not oure alder foo° make his bobaunce,°
That he hath in his listes° of mischaunce°
Convict° that° ye both have bought so dere.°
As I seide erst,° thou ground° of our substaunce,°
Continue° on us thy pitous° eyen° clere!°
 
Moises, that sauh° the bush with flaumes° rede
Brenninge,° of which ther never a stikke° brende,°
Was signe of thin unwemmed° maidenhede.°
Thou art the bush on which ther gan descende°
The Holy Gost, the which that° Moises wende°
Had ben afir;° and this was in figure.°
Now lady, from the fir thou us defende
Which that in helle eternally shal dure.°
 
Noble princess, that never haddest pere,°
Certes,° if any comfort in us be,
That cometh of° thee, thou Cristes moder dere,°
We han° non other melodie or glee°
Us to rejoise° in oure adversitee,
Ne° advocat that wol° and dar so preye°
For us, and that for litel hire° as ye,
That helpen for° an Ave Marie or tweye.°
 
O verrey° light of eyen° that ben blinde,
O verrey lust° of labour° and distresse,
O tresorere° of bountee to mankinde,
Thee whom God chees to° moder for humblesse!°
From his ancille° he made thee maistresse°
Of hevene and erthe, our bille° up for to bede.°
This world awaiteth° ever on° thy goodnesse,
For thou ne failest never wight° at nede.
 
Purpos° I have sum time for t’enquere,°
Wherfore° and why the Holy Gost thee souhte,°
Whan Gabrielles vois cam to thin ere.
He not to werre° us° swich a wonder wrouhte,°
But for to save us that he sithen° bouhte.°
Than needeth us° no wepen us to save,°
But only ther° we did not, as us ouhte,
Do penitence, and mercy axe° and have.
 
Queen of comfort, yit whan I me bithinke°
That I agilt° have bothe, him° and thee,
And that my soule is worthy for to sinke,°
Allas, I, caitif,° whider° may I flee?
Who shal unto thy sone my meen° be?
Who, but thyself, that art of pitee welle?°
Thou hast more reuthe° on oure adversitee
Than in this world miht any tunge telle.
 
Redresse° me, moder, and me chastise,
For, certeinly, my Fadres chastisinge
That dar I nouht° abiden° in no wise:
So hidous° is his rightful° rekeninge.
Moder, of whom our mercy gan to springe,°
Beth ye my juge and eek my soules leche;°
For ever in you is pitee haboundinge°
To ech° that° wol of° pitee you biseche.°
 
Soth° is, that God ne graunteth no° pitee
Withoute thee; for God, of° his goodnesse,
Foryiveth° noon,° but° it like unto° thee.
He hath thee maked vicaire° and maistresse°
Of al the world, and eek governowresse°
Of hevene, and he represseth° his justise
After thy wille, and therefore in witnesse°
He hath thee crouned in so ryal° wise.
 
Temple devout, ther° God hath his woninge.°
Fro which thes misbileved° prived° been,
To you my soule penitent I bringe.
Receive me! I can no ferther fleen!°
With thornes venimous,° O heven queen,
For° which the erthe acursed was ful yore,
I am so wounded, as ye may wel seen,°
That I am lost° almost;—it smert° so sore.°
 
Virgin, that art so noble of apparaile,°
And ledest us into the hye toure
Of Paradis, thou me wisse° and counsaile,°
How I may han thy grace and thy socour;°
Al have I been in filthe and in errour.
Lady, unto that court thou me ajourne°
That cleped° is thy bench,° O fresshe flour!
Theras that° mercy ever shal sojourne.°
 
Xristus,° thy son, that in° this world alighte,°
Upon the cros to suffre his passioun,°
And suffrede eke° that Longius° his herte pighte,°
And made his herte blood to renne° adoun;
And al was this for my salvacioun;
And I to him am fals and eek unkinde,°
And yit he wol not° my dampnacioun—
This thanke I you, socour° of al mankinde.
 
Ysaac was figure° of his deth, certein,
That° so ferforth° his fader wolde obeie
That him ne rouhte nothing° to be slain;
Riht so thy son liste°, as a lamb, to deie.
Now lady, ful of mercy, I you preye,
Sithe he his mercy mesured° so large,°
Be ye not skant;° for al we° singe and seye
That ye ben from vengeaunce ay our targe.°
 
Zacharie you clepeth° the open welle°
To wasshe sinful soule out of his gilt.
Therfor this lessoun ouht° I wel° to telle
That, neer° thy tender hert, we weren° spilt.°
Now lady brighte, sith° thou canst and wilt°
Ben to the seed of Adam° merciable,°
And bring us to that palais° that is bilt
To° penitents that ben to mercy able.° Amen.
