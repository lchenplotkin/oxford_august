Madame, for your newefangelnesse,°
Many a servaunt have ye put oute of grace,°
I take my leve of your unstedfastnesse,°
For wel I wot,° whil ye have lives space,°
Ye kan not love ful half yeer in a place;°
To newe thing° your lust° is ay so kene;°
Insted of blew,° thus may° ye were° al grene.
 
Right° as a mirour nothing may enpresse,°
But, lightly° as it cometh, so mot it pace,°
So fareth° your love, your werkes° bereth witnesse.°
Ther is no feith° that may your herte enbrace;°
But, as a wedercok,° that turneth his face
With every wind, ye fare,° and that is sene;°
Insted of blew, thus may ye were al grene.
 
Ye might be shrined,° for your brotelnesse,°
Bet° than Dalida,° Creseyde or Candace;
For evere° in changing stant° your sikernesse,°
That tach° may no wight° fro your herte arace;°
If ye lese oon, ye kan wel twein° purchace;
Al light for somer,° ye wot wel what I mene,
Insted of blew, thus may ye were al grene.
