The firste stock,° fadir of gentilesse°—
What man° desireth gentil° for to be,
Must folowe his trace,° and alle his wittes° dresse°
Vertu to love, and vices for to flee.
For unto vertu longeth° dignitee,°
And nought the revers, saufly° dar I deme,°
Al° were° he mitre,° croune, or diademe.°
 
This firste stok was full of rightwisnesse,°
Trewe of his word, sobre, pitous,° and free,°
Clene of his goste,° and loved besinesse,°
Ayenst° the vice of slouthe, in honestee;°
And, but° his heir love vertu, as did he,
He is nought gentil, thogh he riche seme,°
Al° were° he miter, croune, or diademe.
 
Vices may wel be heir to old richesse;°
But ther may° no man, as men may wel see,
Bequethe° his heir his vertuous noblesse°—
That is appropred unto° no degree,°
But° to the firste fader in magestee,°
That maketh him his heir, that° can him queme°—
All were he miter, croune, or diademe.
