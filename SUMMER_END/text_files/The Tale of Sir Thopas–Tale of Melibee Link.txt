¶“No moore of this, for Goddes dignitee,”
Quod oure Hoste, “for thou makest me
So wery of thy verray lewednesse°
That, also wisly° God my soule blesse,
Min eres° aken° of thy drasty° speche;
Now swich a rim° the devel I biteche!°
This may wel be rim dogerel,” quod he.

¶“Why so?” quod I, “Why wiltow lette me°
More of my tale than another man,
Sin that it is the beste rim I can?”

¶“By God,” quod he, “for pleinly, at a word,
Thy drasty riming is nat worth a tord;
Thou doost nought elles but despendest° time,
Sire, at o word, thou shalt no lenger rime.
Lat see wher thou canst tellen aught in geste,°
Or telle in prose somwhat at the leste
In which ther be som mirthe or som doctrine.&apos;

¶“Gladly,” quod I, “by Goddes swete pine,°
I wol yow telle a litel thing in prose,
That oghte like yow,° as I suppose,
Or elles, certes, ye been to daungerous.°
It is a moral tale vertuous,
Al be it° told somtime in sondry wise°
Of sondry folk, as I shal yow devise.

¶“As thus; ye woot° that every evangelist,°
That telleth us the peine of Jesu Crist,
Ne saith nat al thing as his felaw dooth,
But natheles, hir sentence° is al sooth,°
And alle acorden as in hir sentence,
Al be ther in hir telling difference.
For somme of hem seyn more, and som lesse,
Whan they his pitous passioun expresse;
I mene of Mark and Mathew, Luk and John;
But doutelees hir sentence is al oon.
Therfore, lordings alle, I yow biseche,
If that ye thinke I varie as in my speche,
As thus, thogh that I telle somwhat more
Of proverbes, than ye han herd bifore,
Comprehended in this litel tretis here,
To enforcen with° the th’effect of my matere,
And thogh I nat the same wordes seye
As ye han herd, yet to yow alle I preye,
Blameth me nat; for, as in my sentence,
Ye shul not finden moche difference
Fro the sentence of this tretis lite°
After the which this mury tale I write.
And therfor herkneth what that I shal seye,
And lat me tellen al my tale, I preye.”
