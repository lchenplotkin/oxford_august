¶In Armorik,° that called is Britaine,°
Ther was a knight that loved and dide his paine
To serve a lady in his beste wise;°
And many a labour, many a greet emprise°
He for his lady wroghte,° er° she wer wonne.
For she was oon° the faireste under sonne,
And eek therto° come of so heigh kinrede,°
That wel unnethes° dorst° this knight, for drede,
Telle hir his wo, his peine, and his distresse.
But atte laste, she, for his worthinesse,
And namely° for his meke obeisaunce,°
Hath swich a pitee caught of his penaunce,°
That prively° she fil of his accord°
To take him for hir housbonde and hir lord,
Of swich° lordshipe as men han over hir wives;
And for to lede the more in blisse hir lives,
Of his free wil he swoor hir as a knight,
That never in al his lif he, day ne night,
Ne sholde upon him take no maistrie°
Again hir wil, ne kithe° hir jalousie,
But hir obeie, and folwe hir wil in al
As any lover to his lady shal;
Save° that the name° of soverainetee,°
That wolde he have for shame° of his degree.°

¶She thanked him, and with ful greet humblesse°
She seide, “Sir, sith° of your gentillesse°
Ye profre me to have so large a reine,°
Ne wolde never God° bitwixe us tweine,
As in my gilt,° were° outher° werre or strif.
Sire, I wol be your humble trewe wif,
Have heer my trouthe,° til that min herte breste.”°
Thus been° they bothe in quiete and in reste.

¶For o° thing, sires, saufly° dar I seye,
That frendes everich° other moot° obeye,
If they wol longe holden compaignie.
Love wol nat ben constreined by maistrie;°
Whan maistrie comth, the god of love anon
Beteth his wings, and farwel! he is gon!
Love is a thing as any spirit free;
Wommen of kind° desiren libertee,
And nat to ben constreined as a thral;°
And so doon men, if I soth seyen shal.
Look who that is° moost pacient in love,
He is at his avantage al above.
Pacience is an heigh vertu certein;°
For it venquisseth,° as thise clerkes seyn,
Thinges that rigour sholde nevere atteine.°
For every word men may nat chide or pleine.°
Lerneth to suffre, or els, so moot I goon,°
Ye shul it lern, wherso° ye wole or noon.°
For in this world, certein, ther no wight is,
That he ne dooth or seith somtime amis.°
Ire, siknesse, or constellacioun,°
Win,° wo, or chaunginge of complexioun°
Causeth ful oft to doon amis or speken.
On every wrong a man may nat be wreken;°
After° the time, most be temperaunce°
To every wight that can on° governaunce.
And therfore hath this wise worthy knight,
To live in ese, suffrance° hir bihight,°
And she to him ful wisly° gan to swere
That never shold ther be defaute° in here.°

¶Heer may men seen an humble wis accord;
Thus hath she take° hir servant and hir lord,
Servant in love, and lord in mariage;
Than was he bothe in lordship and servage;°
Servage? nay, but in lordshipe above,
Sith° he hath bothe his lady and his love;
His lady, certes, and his wif also,
The which that° lawe of love acordeth° to.

¶And whan he was in this prosperitee,
Hoom with his wif he gooth to his contree,
Nat fer fro Penmark, ther° his dwelling was,
Wheras° he liveth in blisse and in solas.°

¶Who coude tell, but° he had wedded be,°
The joy, the ese, and the prosperitee°
That is bitwixe an housbonde and his wif?
A yeer and moore lasted this blisful lif,
Til that the knight of which I speke of thus,
That of Kairrud was cleped° Arveragus,
Shoop him° to goon, and dwelle a yeer or tweine
In Engelond, that cleped was eek Briteine,
To seke in armes worship° and honour;
For al his lust° he sette in swich labour;
And dwelled ther two yeer, the book seith thus.

¶Now wol I stinte° of this Arveragus,
And speke I wole of Dorigene his wif,
That° loveth hir housbonde as hir hertes lif.°
For his absence wepeth she and siketh,°
As doon thise noble wives whan hem liketh.°
She moorneth,° waketh, waileth, fasteth, pleineth;°
Desir of his presence hir so distreineth,°
That al this wide world she sette at noght.°
Hir frendes, which that° knewe hir hevy° thoght,
Conforten° hir in al that ever they may;
They prechen° hir, they telle hir night and day,
That causelees she sleeth° hirself, allas!
And every confort possible in this cas°
They doon to hir with al hir bisinesse,°
Al for to make hir leve hir hevinesse.

¶By proces,° as ye knowen everichoon,°
Men may so longe graven° in a stoon,
Til som figure therinne emprented° be.
So longe han they conforted hir, til she
Received hath, by hope and by resoun,
The emprenting° of hir° consolacioun,
Thurgh which hir grete sorwe gan aswage;°
She may nat alwey duren° in swich rage.°

¶And eek Arveragus, in al this care,°
Hath sent hir lettres hoom of his welfare,
And that he wol com hastily again;
Or elles had° this sorwe hir herte slain.

¶Hir freendes sawe hir sorwe gan to slake,°
And preyede hir on knees, for Goddes sake,
To come and romen hir° in compaignie,°
Awey to drive hir derke fantasie.°
And finally, she graunted that requeste;
For wel she saugh that it was for the beste.

¶Now stood hir castel faste by° the see,
And often with hir freendes walketh she
Hir to disporte upon° the bank an heigh,
Wheras° she many a shipe and barge° seigh
Seilinge° hir cours, wheras hem liste go;°
But than was that a parcel° of hir wo.
For to hirself ful ofte “Allas!” seith she,
“Is ther no ship, of so many as I see,
Wol° bringen hom my lord? than were min herte
Al warisshed° of his° bittre peines smerte.”°

¶Another time ther wold she sitte and thinke,
And caste hir eyen dounward fro the brinke.°
But whan she saugh the grisly° rokkes blake,
For verray feer° so wolde hir herte quake,
That on hir feet she mighte hir noght sustene.°
Than wold she sitte adoun upon the grene,
And pitously° into the see biholde,°
And seyn right thus, with sorweful sikes° colde:

¶“Eterne God, that thurgh thy purveiaunce°
Ledest° the world by certein governaunce,°
In idel,° as men seyn, ye nothing make;
But, lord, thise grisly feendly° rokkes blake,
That seem rather a foul confusioun°
Of werk than any fair creacioun
Of swich a parfit wis God and a stable,°
Why han ye wroght° this werk unresonable?
For by this werk, south, north, ne west, ne eest,
Ther nis° yfostred° man, ne brid,° ne beest;
It dooth no good, to my wit, but anoyeth.°
See ye nat, lord, how mankinde it destroyeth?
An hundred thousand bodies of mankinde
Han rokkes slain, al be they nat in minde,
Which mankinde is so fair part of thy werk
That thou it madest lik to thin own merk.°
Than semed it ye hadde a greet chiertee°
Toward mankind; but how than may it be
That ye swich menes° make it to destroyen,
Whiche menes do no good, but evere anoyen?°
I woot wel clerkes wol seyn, as hem leste,°
By argumentz, that al is for the beste,
Though I ne can the causes nat yknowe.
But thilke° God, that made wind to blowe,
As kepe° my lord! this° my conclusioun;
To clerkes lete° I al disputisoun.°
But wolde God that al thise rokkes blake
Wer sonken° into helle for his sake!
Thise rokkes sleen min herte for the fere.”
Thus wold she seyn, with many a pitous° tere.

¶Hir freendes saw that it was no disport°
To romen by the see, but disconfort;°
And shopen° for to pleyen somwher elles.
They leden° hir by rivers and by welles,°
And eek in other places delitables;°
They dauncen, and they pleyen at ches and tables.°

¶So on a day,° right in the morwe-tide,°
Unto a gardin that was ther biside,
In which that they had maad hir ordinaunce°
Of vitaille° and of other purveiaunce,°
They goon and pleye hem al the longe day.
And this was on the sixte morwe of May,
Which May had peinted with his° softe shoures
This gardin ful of leves and of floures;
And craft of mannes hand so curiously°
Arrayed° had this gardin, trewely,
That never was ther gardin of swich pris,
But if° it wer the verray paradis.°
The odour of floures and the fresshe sighte
Wolde han maad any herte for to lighte°
That ever was born, but if° to gret siknesse,
Or to greet sorwe helde it in distresse;
So ful it was of beautee with plesaunce.°
At after diner° gonne they to daunce,
And singe also, save° Dorigen allone,
Which made alwey° hir compleint and hir mone;°
For° she ne saugh him on the daunce go,
That was hir housbonde and hir love also.
But nathelees she moste a time abide,°
And with good hope lete hir sorwe slide.°

¶Upon this daunce, amonges othere men,
Daunced a squier biforen Dorigen,
That fressher was and jolier° of array,°
As to my doom,° than is the monthe of May.
He singeth, daunceth, passinge° any man
That is, or was, sith° that the world bigan.
Therwith° he was, if men sholde him discrive,
Oon of the beste faring° man on live;
Yong, strong, right vertuous, and riche and wis,
And wel biloved, and holden in gret pris.°
And shortly, if the sothe° I tellen shal,
Unwiting of° this Dorigen at al,
This lusty squier, servant to Venus,
Which that ycleped° was Aurelius,
Had loved hir best of any creature
Two yeer and more, as was his aventure,°
But never dorste he telle hir his grevaunce;°
Withouten coppe he drank al his penaunce.
He was despeired, nothing dorste° he seye,
Save in his songes somwhat wolde he wreye°
His wo, as in a general compleining;
He seide he lovede, and was biloved nothing.°
Of swich matere made he many layes,
Songes, compleintes, roundels, virelaies,°
How that he dorste° nat his sorwe telle,
But languissheth,° as a furie dooth in helle;
And die he moste, he seide, as dide Ekko
For Narcisus, that dorst nat telle hir wo.
In other maner than ye heer me seye,
Ne dorste he nat to hir his wo biwreye;°
Save° that, paraventure,° somtime at daunces,
Ther° yonge folk kepen° hir observaunces,°
It may wel be he looked on hir face
In swich a wise, as man that asketh grace;°
But nothing wiste° she of his entente.
Nathelees, it happed, er° they thennes° wente,
Bicause that he was hir neighebour,
And was a man of worship° and honour,
And hadde yknowen him of time yore,°
They fille in speche;° and forthe more and more
Unto this purpos drough° Aurelius,
And whan he saugh his time, he seide thus:

¶“Madame,” quod he, “by God that this world made,
So that° I wiste it might your herte glade,°
I wold,° that day that your Arveragus
Wente over the see, that I, Aurelius,
Had went° ther never I sholde have come again;
For wel I woot my service is in vain.
My gerdon° is but bresting° of min herte;
Madame, reweth° upon my peines smerte;
For with a word ye may me sleen° or save,
Heer at your feet God wold that I were grave!°
I have as now no leiser° mor to seye;
Have mercy, swete, or ye wol do me° deye!”

¶She gan to loke upon Aurelius:
“Is this your wil,” quod she, “and sey ye thus?
Nevere erst,”° quod she, “ne wiste I° what ye mente.
But now, Aurelie, I knowe youre entente,
By thilke God that yaf° me soule and lif,
Ne shal I never been untrewe° wif
In word ne werk,° as fer as I have wit:°
I wol ben his to whom that I am knit;
Tak this for final answere as of me.”
But after that in pley° thus seide she:

¶“Aurelie,” quod she, “by heigh God above,
Yet wolde I graunte yow to been your love,
Sin I yow see so pitously° complaine;
Look what day that, endelong° Britaine,°
Ye remoeve al the rokkes, stoon by stoon,
That they ne lette° ship ne° boot to goon—
I sey, whan ye han maad the coost so clene
Of rokkes, that ther nis° no stoon ysene,
Than wol I love yow best of any man;
Have heer my trouthe° in al that ever I can.”

¶“Is ther non other grace in yow,” quod he.
“No, by that lord,” quod she, “that maked me!
For wel I woot that it shal never bitide.°
Lat swich folies out of your herte slide.°
What deintee° sholde a man han in his lif
For to go love another mannes wif,
That hath hir body whan so that him liketh?”°

¶Aurelius ful ofte sore siketh;°
Wo was Aurelie, whan that he this herde,
And with a sorweful herte he thus answerde:
“Madame,” quod he, “this were an inpossible!°
Than moot° I die of sodein deth horrible.”
And with that word he turned him° anoon.°
Tho° come° hir other freendes many oon,
And in the aleys° romeden up and doun,
And nothing wiste of this conclusioun,°
But sodeinly bigonne revel° newe
Til that the brighte sonne loste his hewe;°
For th’orisonte° hath reft° the sonne his light;
This is as much to seye as it was night.
And hoom they goon in joye and in solas,°
Save only wrecche° Aurelius, allas!
He to his hous is goon with sorweful herte;
He seeth he may nat fro his deeth asterte.°
Him semed° that he felte his herte colde;
Up to the hevene his handes he gan holde,
And on his knowes° bare he sette him doun,
And in his raving seide his orisoun.°
For verray° wo out of his wit he breide.
He niste° what he spak, but thus he seide;
With pitous herte his pleint° hath he bigonne
Unto the gods, and first unto the sonne:

¶He seide, “Appollo, god and governour°
Of every plaunte, herbe, tree and flour,
That yevest,° after thy declinacioun,°
To ech of hem his time and his sesoun,
As thin herberwe° chaungeth lowe or heighe,
Lord Phebus, cast thy merciable° eighe
On wrecche Aurelie, which that am but lorn.°
Lo, lord! my lady hath my deeth ysworn°
Withoute gilt, but° thy benignitee
Upon my dedly° herte have som pitee!
For wel I woot, lord Phebus, if yow lest,°
Ye may me helpen, save° my lady, best.
Now voucheth sauf° that° I may yow devise
How that I may been holpe° and in what wise.

¶“Your blisful suster, Lucina° the shene,°
That of the see is chief goddesse and quene,
Though Neptunus have deitee° in the see,
Yet emperesse aboven him is she:
Ye know wel, lord, that right° as hir desir
Is to be quiked° and lightned° of your fir,
For which she folweth yow ful bisily,°
Right so the see desireth naturelly
To folwen hir, as she that° is goddesse
Bothe in the see and rivers more and lesse.°
Wherfor, lord Phebus, this is my requeste—
Do° this miracle, or do min herte breste°—
That now, next at this opposicioun,°
Which in the sign shal be of the Leoun,°
As preyeth hir° so greet a flood to bringe,
That five fadme° at the leeste it overspringe°
The hyest rokke in Armorik Briteine;
And lat this flood endure yeres tweine;
Than certes to my lady may I seye:
‘Holdeth your hest,° the rokkes been aweye.’

¶“Lord Phebus, dooth this miracle for me;
Pray hir she go no faster cours than ye;
I seye, preyeth your suster° that she go
No faster cours than ye thise yeres two.
Than shal she been evene° at fulle° alway,
And spring flood° laste bothe night and day.
And, but she° vouche-sauf° in swich° manere
To graunte me my soverein lady dere,
Pray° hir to sinken every rok adoun
Into hir owne derke regioun
Under the ground, ther° Pluto dwelleth inne,
Or never mo shal I my lady winne.
Thy temple in Delphos° wol I barfoot seke;
Lord Phebus, see the teres on my cheke,
And of° my peine have som compassioun.”
And with that word in swowne° he fil adoun,
And longe time he lay forth° in a traunce.

¶His brother, which that knew of his penaunce,°
Up caughte him and to bedde he hath him broght.
Dispeired in° this torment and this thoght
Lete I this woful creature lie;
Chese he,° for me, wher° he wol live or dye.

¶Arveragus, with heele° and greet honour,
As he that was of chivalrie the flour,
Is comen hoom, and other worthy men.
O blisful artow now, thou Dorigen,
That hast thy lusty° housbonde in thine armes,
The fresshe° knight, the worthy man of armes,
That loveth thee, as his own hertes lif.
Nothing list him° to been imaginatif°
If any wight had spoke, whil he was oute,
To hire of love; he hadde of it no doute.°
He noght entendeth° to no swich matere,°
But daunceth, justeth, maketh hir good chere;°
And thus in joye and blisse I lete hem dwelle,
And of the sike Aurelius wol I telle.

¶In langour° and in torment furious
Two yeer and more lay wrecche° Aurelius,
Er any foot he mighte on erthe goon;°
Ne confort in this time hadde he noon,
Save of° his brother, which that° was a clerk;°
He knew of al this wo and al this werk.°
For to non other creature certein
Of this matere he dorste° no word seyn.
Under his brest he bar it more secree°
Than ever dide Pamphilus for Galathee.
His brest was hool, withoute° for to sene,
But in his herte ay was the arwe° kene.
And wel ye know that of a sursanure°
In surgerie is perilous° the cure,
But° men might touch° the arwe, or com therby.°

¶His brother weepe° and wailed prively,°
Til atte laste him fil in remembraunce,°
That whil he was at Orliens in Fraunce,
As yonge clerkes, that been likerous°
To reden° artes° that been curious,°
Seken in every halke° and every herne°
Particuler° sciences for to lerne,
He him remembred that, upon a day,°
At Orliens in studie a book he say°
Of magik natural,° which his felawe,
That was that time a bacheler of lawe,
Al were he° ther to lerne another craft,°
Had prively upon his desk ylaft;°
Which book spak muchel of° the operaciouns,
Touching° the eighte and twenty mansiouns°
That longen° to the mone,° and swich folie,°
As in our dayes is nat worth a flie;
For holy chirches feith in our bileve°
Ne suffreth° noon° illusion us to greve.°
And whan this book was in his remembraunce,
Anon for joye his herte gan to daunce,
And to himself he seide prively:°

¶“My brother shal be warisshed° hastily;
For I am siker that ther be sciences,
By whiche men make diverse apparences°
Swiche as thise subtile tregetoures° pleye.
For ofte at festes have I wel herd seye,°
That tregetours,° withinne an halle large,
Have maad come in a water and a barge,°
And in the halle rowen up and doun.
Somtime hath semed come a grim leoun;
And somtime floures springe as in a mede;°
Somtime a vine, and grapes white and rede;
Somtime a castel, al of lim° and stoon;
And whan hem liked, voided it° anoon
Thus semed it to every mannes sighte.

¶“Now than conclude I° thus, that if I mighte
At Orliens som old felawe° yfinde,
That had this mones mansions in minde,
Or other magik naturel above,°
He sholde wel make my brother han his love.
For with an apparence° a clerk may make
To° mannes sight, that al the rokkes blake
Of Britaigne weren yvoided° everichon,°
And shippes by the brinke° comen and gon,
And in swich forme endure a wowke° or two;
Than wer my brother warisshed° of his wo.
Than most she nedes° holden° hir biheste,°
Or elles he shal shame hir atte leste.”

¶What° sholde I make a lenger tale of this?
Unto his brothers bed he comen is,
And swich confort he yaf him for to gon
To Orliens, that he up stirte° anon
And on his wey forthward° thanne is he fare,°
In hope for to ben lissed° of his care.

¶Whan they were come almost to that citee,
But if it° were a two furlong or three,
A yong clerk roming° by himself they mette,
Which that° in Latin thriftily° hem grette,°
And after that he seide a wonder° thing:
“I know,” quod he, “the cause of your coming”;
And er they ferther any fote° wente,
He tolde hem al that was in hir entente.

¶This Briton° clerk him asked of° felawes
The which° that he had knowe in olde dawes;°
And he answerde him that they dede° were,
For which he weep ful ofte many a tere.

¶Doun of° his hors Aurelius lighte° anon,
And forth with this magicien is he gon
Hoom to his hous, and made hem wel at ese.
Hem lakked no vitail° that mighte hem plese;
So wel arrayed° hous as° ther was oon
Aurelius in his lif saugh never noon.

¶He shewed him, er he went to sopeer,°
Forestes, parkes° ful of wilde deer;
Ther saugh he hertes° with hir hornes hye,
The grettest that ever were seyn with eye.
He saugh of hem an hondred slain with houndes,
And som with arwes blede of° bittre woundes.
He saugh, whan voided° wer thise wilde deer,
Thise fauconers° upon a fair river,
That with hir haukes han the heron slain.
Tho° saugh he knightes justing° in° a plain;
And after this, he dide him swich plesaunce,°
That he him shewed his lady on° a daunce
On which himself he daunced, as him thoughte.
And whan this maister, that° this magik wroughte,
Saugh it was time, he clapte his handes two,
And farwel! al our revel° was ago.
And yet remoeved° they never out of the hous,
Whil they saugh al this sighte merveillous,
But in his studie, theras° his bookes be,
They seten° stille, and no wight but° they three.

¶To him this maister called his squier,
And seide him thus: “Is redy our soper?
Almost an houre it is, I undertake,°
Sith I yow bad our soper for to make,
Whan that thise worthy men wenten with me
Into my studie, theras° my bookes be.”

¶“Sir,” quod this squier, “whan it liketh yow,°
It is al redy, though ye wol right now.”
“Go we than soup,”° quod he, “as for the beste;
This° amorous folk somtime mote° han reste.”

¶At after soper fill they° in tretee,°
What somme° shold this maistres gerdon° be,
To remoeven al the rokkes of Britaine,
And eek from Geround° to the mouth of Saine.°

¶He made it straunge,° and swoor, so God him save,
Lass than a thousand pound he wold nat have,
Ne gladly for that somme° he wold nat goon.

¶Aurelius, with blisful herte anoon,
Answerde thus, “Fy on a thousand pound!
This wide world, which that men seye is round,
I wolde it yeve, if I wer lord of it.
This bargain is ful drive,° for we ben knit.°
Ye shal be payed trewly, by my trouthe!
But looketh now, for no necligence or slouthe,°
Ye tarie° us heer no lenger than tomorwe.”
“Nay,” quod this clerk, “have heer my feith° to borwe.”

¶To bedde is goon Aurelius whan him leste,°
And wel ny al that night he hadde his reste;
What for° his labour and his hope of blisse,
His woful herte of penaunce hadde a lisse.°

¶Upon the morwe, whan that it was day,
To Britain tooke they the righte° way,
Aurelius, and this magicien biside,
And been descended° ther° they wolde abide;°
And this was, as the bookes me remembre,
The colde frosty seson of Decembre.

¶Phebus wex° old, and hewed lik latoun,°
That in his hote declinacioun°
Shoon as the burned° gold with stremes brighte;
But now in Capricorn adoun he lighte,°
Whereas° he shoon ful pale, I dar wel seyn.
The bittre frostes, with the sleet and rein,
Destroyed hath the grene in every yerd.
Janus sit by the fir, with double berd,
And drinketh of his bugle horn° the win.
Biforn him stant braun° of the tusked swin,°
And “Nowel” crieth every lusty man.

¶Aurelius, in al that° evere he can,
Doth to this maister chere° and reverence,
And preyeth him to doon his diligence
To bringen him out of his peines smerte,
Or with a swerd that he wold slitte his herte.

¶This subtil° clerk swich routh° had of this man,
That night and day he spedde him° that he can,°
To waite° a time of his conclusioun;
This is to seyn, to make illusioun,
By swich an apparence or jogelrie,°
I can no° termes of astrologie,
That she and every wight shold wene° and seye,
That of Britain the rokkes were aweye,
Or elles they were sonken under grounde.
So atte laste he hath his time yfounde
To make his japes° and his wrecchednesse°
Of swich a superstitious cursednesse.
His tables Tolletanes° forth he broght,
Ful wel corrected, ne ther lakked noght,°
Neither his collect° ne his expans yeres,°
Ne hise rotes° ne hise other geres,°
As been his centres° and hise argumentz,°
And his proporcionels convenientz°
For hise equacions° in every thing.
And, by his eighte spere° in his wirking,°
He knew ful wel how fer Alnath° was shove°
Fro the heed of thilke fixe Aries° above
That in the ninthe speere° considered is;
Ful subtilly° he calculed° al this

¶Whan he had founde his firste mansioun,°
He knew the remenant by proporcioun;°
And knew the arising of his moone weel,
And in whos face,° and terme, and every deel;°
And knew ful weel the moones mansioun°
Acordaunt° to his operacioun,
And knew also hise othere observaunces°
For swiche illusiouns and swich meschaunces°
As hethen folk used in thilke dayes;
For which no lenger maked he delayes,
But thurgh his magik, for a wike or tweye,°
It semed that al the rokkes were aweye.

¶Aurelius, which that yet despeired° is
Wher° he shal han his love or fare amis,°
Awaiteth° night and day on° this miracle;
And whan he knew that ther was noon obstacle,
That voided° were thes rokkes everichon,
Doun to his maistres feet he fil° anon,
And seide, “I woful wrecche, Aurelius,
Thank yow, lord, and lady min Venus,
That me han holpen° fro my cares colde”:°
And to the temple his wey forth hath he holde,
Wheras° he knew he sholde his lady see.
And whan he saugh his time, anonright he,
With dredful° herte and with ful humble chere,°
Salewed° hath his soverein lady dere:

¶“My righte° lady,” quod this woful man,
“Whom I most drede° and love as I best can,
And lothest° were of al this world displese,
Nere it° that I for yow have swich disese,°
That I most die heer at your foot anon,
Noght wolde I° tell how me is wo bigon;°
But certes outher° moste I die or pleine;°
Ye slee me giltelees for verray° peine.
But of my deeth, thogh that ye have no routhe,°
Aviseth yow,° er that ye breek your trouthe.°
Repenteth yow, for thilke God above,
Er ye me sleen bicause that I yow love.
For, madame, wel ye woot what ye han hight;°
Nat that I chalange° any thing of right°
Of yow my soverein lady, but your grace;
But in a gardin yond,° at swich a place,
Ye woot right wel what ye bihighten° me;
And in min hand your trouthe plighten° ye
To love me best, God woot, ye seide so,
Al be that I° unworthy be therto.
Madame, I speke it for° the honour of yow,
Mor than to save min hertes lif right now;
I have do° so as ye comanded me;
And if ye vouchesauf,° ye may go see.
Doth as yow list, have your biheste° in minde,
For quik° or deed, right ther ye shul me finde;
In yow lith al, to do° me live or deye;—
But wel I woot the rokkes been aweye!”°

¶He taketh his leve, and she astonied° stood,
In al hir face nas° a drope of blood;
She wende° never han come in swich a trappe:

¶“Allas!” quod she, “That ever this shold happe!°
For wende I never, by possibilitee,
That swich a monstre° or merveil might be!
It is agains the proces of nature”:
And hoom she gooth a sorweful creature.
For verray° fere unnethe° may she go,°
She wepeth, wailleth, al a day or two,
And swowneth,° that it routhe° was to see;
But why it was to no wight tolde she,
For out of town was goon Arveragus.
But to hirself she spak, and seide thus,
With face pale and with ful sorweful chere,°
In hir compleint, as ye shul after here:
“Allas,” quod she, “on° thee, Fortune, I pleine,°
That unwar° wrapped hast me in thy cheine;
For which, t’escape, woot I no socour°
Save° only deeth or elles dishonour;
Oon of thise two bihoveth me° to chese.
But nathelees, yet have I lever° to lese°
My lif than of my body have a shame,
Or know myselven fals, or lees my name,
And with my deth I may be quit,° ywis.
Hath ther nat many a noble wif, er this,
And many a maide yslain hirself, allas!
Rather than with hir body doon trespas?°

¶“Yis, certes, lo, thise stories bere witnesse;
Whan thritty tiraunts, ful of cursednesse,
Had slain Phidoun in Athens, atte feste,
They comanded his doghtres for t’areste,°
And bringen hem biforn hem in despit°
Al naked, to fulfille hir° foul delit
And in hir fadres blood they made hem daunce
Upon the pavement, God yeve° hem mischaunce!°
For which thise woful maidens, ful of drede,
Rather than they wolde lees hir maidenhede,°
They prively° ben stirt° into a welle,
And dreinte° hemselven, as the bookes telle.

¶“They of Messene lete enquere° and seke
Of° Lacedomie fifty maidens eke,
On which they wolden doon hir lecherie;
But was ther noon of al that compaignie
That she nas° slain, and with a good entente°
Chees rather for to dye than assente
To been oppressed° of hir maidenhede.
Why sholde I than to dye been in drede?
Lo, eek, the tiraunt Aristoclides
That loved a maiden, hight° Stimphalides,
Whan that hir fader slain was on a night,
Unto Dianes temple goth she right,°
And hent° the image in hir handes two,
Fro which image wold she never go.
No wight ne mighte hir hands of it arace,
Til she was slain right in the selve° place.

¶“Now sith that maidens hadden swich despit°
To been defouled° with mannes foul delit,
Wel oghte a wif rather hirselven slee
Than be defouled, as it thinketh me.
What shal I seyn of Hasdrubales wif,
That at Cartage birafte° hirself hir° lif?
For whan she saugh that Romains wan the toun,
She took hir children alle, and skipte° adoun
Into the fir, and chees rather to die
Than any Romain dide° hir vileinie.°
Hath nat Lucresse yslain hirself, allas!
At Rome, whanne she oppressed° was
Of° Tarquin, for hir thoughte it was a shame
To liven whan she hadde lost hir name?°
The seven maidens of Milesie also
Han slain hemself, for verray° drede and wo,
Rather than folk of Gaule hem sholde oppresse.
Mo than a thousand stories, as I gesse,
Coude I now telle as touching this matere.°
Whan Habradas was slain, his wif so dere
Hirselven slow,° and leet hir blood to glide
In Habradaces woundes depe and wide,
And seid, ‘My body, at the leeste way,°
Ther shal no wight defoulen, if I may.’

¶“What sholde I mo ensamples heerof° sayn,
Sith that so manie han hemselven slain
Wel rather than they wold defouled be?
I wol conclude, that it is bet° for me
To sleen myself, than been defouled thus.
I wol be trewe unto Arveragus,
Or rather° sleen myself in som manere,
As did Demociones doghter dere,
Bicause that she wold nat defouled be.
O Cedasus! it is ful greet pitee,
To reden how thy doghtren deide,° allas!
That slow hemselven for swich maner cas.°
As greet a pitee was it, or wel more,
The Theban maiden, that for Nichanore
Hirselven slow, right for swich maner° wo.
Another Theban maiden did right so;°
For oon of Macedoigne hadde hir oppressed,°
She with hir deeth hir maidenhed redressed.°
What shal I seye of Nicerates wif,
That for swich cas birafte hirself hir° lif?
How trewe eek was to Alcebiades
His love, that rather for to dyen chees
Than for to suffre° his body unburied be!
Lo which° a wif was Alceste,” quod she.
“What seith Omer of good Penalopee?
Al Grece knoweth of hir chastitee.
Pardee,° of Laodomia is writen thus,
That whan at Troy was slain Protheselaus,
No lenger wold she live after his day.
The same of noble Porcia telle I may;
Withoute Brutus coude she nat live,
To whom she hadde al hool° hir herte yive.°
The parfit wifhod° of Arthemesie
Honoured is thurgh al the Barbarie,
O Teuta, queen! thy wifly chastitee
To alle wives may a mirour be.
The same thing I seye of Bilia,
Of Rodogone, and eek Valeria.”

¶Thus pleined° Dorigene a day or tweye,
Purposinge ever that she wolde deye.
But nathelees, upon the thridde night,
Hom cam Arveragus, this worthy knight,
And asked hir, why that she weep° so sore?
And she gan wepen ever lenger the more.°

¶“Allas!” quod she, “that ever was I born!
Thus have I seid,” quod she, “thus have I sworn”—
And told him al as ye han herd bifore;
It nedeth nat reherce° it yow namore.

¶This housbond with glad chere,° in freendly wise,
Answerde and seide as I shal yow devise:°
“Is ther oght° elles, Dorigen, but this?”
“Nay, nay,” quod she, “God help me so, as wis,°
This is to muche, and° it were Goddes wille.”

¶“Ye, wif,” quod he, “lat slepen that° is stille;°
It may be wel, paraunter,° yet today.°
Ye shul your trouthe° holden,° by my fay!
For God so wisly° have mercy on me,
I had wel lever° stiked° for to be,
For verray° love which that I to yow have,
But if ye shold° your trouthe kepe and save.°
Trouthe is the hyest thing that man may kepe”:—
But with that word he brast anon to wepe,°
And seide, “I yow forbede, up° peine of deeth,
That never, whil thee lasteth lif ne breeth,
To no wight tel thou of this aventure.°
As I may best, I wol my wo endure,
Ne make no contenance° of hevinesse,°
That folk of° yow may demen° harm or gesse.”°

¶And forth he cleped° a squier and a maide:
“Goth forth anon with Dorigen,” he saide,
“And bringeth hir to swich a place anon.”°
They take° hir° leve, and on hir wey they gon;
But they ne wiste why she thider wente.
He nolde no wight° tellen his entente.°

¶Paraventure° an heep° of yow, ywis,
Wol holden° him a lewed° man in this,
That he wol putte his wif in jupartie;°
Herkneth° the tale, er ye upon hir crie.
She may have bettre fortune than yow semeth;°
And whan that ye han herd the tale, demeth.°

¶This squier, which that highte° Aurelius,
On° Dorigen that was so amorus,°
Of aventure° happed hir to mete
Amid° the toun, right in the quikkest° strete,
As she was boun to° goon the wey° forthright°
Toward the gardin theras° she had hight.°
And he was to the gardinward° also;
For wel he spied,° whan she wolde go
Out of hir hous to any maner place.
But thus they mette, of aventure° or grace;°
And he salueth° hir with glad entente,°
And asked of hir whiderward° she wente?
And she answerde, half as° she wer mad,
“Unto the gardin, as min housbond bad,°
My trouthe° for to holde,° allas! allas!”

¶Aurelius gan wondren on this cas,°
And in his hert had greet compassioun
Of° hire and of hir lamentacioun,
And of° Arveragus, the worthy knight,
That bad hir holden° al that she had hight,°
So looth him was° his wif shold breke hir trouthe;
And in his herte he caughte of this greet routhe,°
Considering the beste on every side,
That fro his lust° yet were him lever° abide°
Than doon so heigh a cherlish° wrecchednesse
Agains franchise° and alle gentillesse;°
For which in fewe wordes seide he thus:

¶“Madame, seith to your lord Arveragus,
That sith° I see his grete gentillesse
To yow, and eek I see wel your distresse,
That him were levere han shame° (and that were routhe°)
Than° ye to me shold breke thus your trouthe,
I have wel levere° ever to suffre wo
Than I depart° the love bitwix yow two.
I yow relesse,° madame, into your hond
Quit° every serement° and every bond,°
That ye han maad to me as heerbiforn,°
Sith thilke time which that ye were born.
My trouthe I plighte,° I shal yow never repreve°
Of no biheste,° and here I taak my leve,
As of° the treweste and the beste wif
That ever yet I knew in al my lif.
But every wif be war of° hir biheste,
On Dorigen remembreth° at the leste.
Thus can a squier doon a gentil dede,
As well as can a knight, withouten drede.”°

¶She thonketh him upon hir knees al bare,
And hoom unto hir housbond is she fare,°
And tolde him al as ye han herd me said;
And be ye siker,° he was so wel apaid,°
That it were inpossible me to write;
What° sholde I lenger of this cas endite?°
Arveragus and Dorigene his wif
In soverein° blisse leden forth° hir° lif.
Nevere eft° ne was ther angre hem bitwene;
He cherisseth hire as though she were a quene;
And she was to him trew for evermore.
Of thise two folk ye gete of me namore.

¶Aurelius, that his cost° hath al forlorn,°
Curseth the time that evere he was born:
“Allas,” quod he, “allas! That I bihighte°
Of pured° gold a thousand pound of wighte°
Unto this philosophre! how shal I do?°
I see namoor° but that I am fordo.°
Min heritage moot I nedes° selle,
And been a begger; heer may I nat dwelle,°
And shamen al my kinrede° in this place,
But° I of him may gete bettre grace.°
But nathelees, I wole of him assaie,°
At certein dayes, yeer by yeer, to paye,
And thanke him of his grete curteisie;
My trouthe° wol I kepe, I wol nat lie.”

¶With herte soor° he gooth unto his cofre,
And broghte gold unto this philosophre,
The value of five hundred pound, I gesse,
And him bisecheth,° of° his gentillesse,°
To graunte him dayes° of the remenaunt,°
And seid, “Maister, I dar wel make avaunt,°
I failed nevere of my trouthe as yit;
For sikerly my dette shal be quit°
Towardes yow, however that I fare°
To goon abegged° in my kirtle bare.°
But wold ye° vouchesauf,° upon seurtee,°
Two yeer or three for to respiten° me,
Than were I wel;° for elles moot° I selle
Min heritage; ther is namoor to telle.”

¶This philosophre sobrely° answerde,
And seide thus, whan he thise wordes herde:
“Have I nat holden covenant° unto thee?”
“Yes, certes, wel and trewely,” quod he.
“Hastow nat had thy lady as thee liketh?”
“No, no,” quod he, and sorwfully he siketh.°
“What was the cause? tel me if thou can.”

¶Aurelius his tale anon bigan,
And tolde him al, as ye han herd bifore;
It nedeth nat° to yow reherce° it more.
He seide, “Arveragus, of gentillesse,°
Had lever° die in sorwe and in distresse
Than that his wif were of hir trouthe° fals.”
The sorwe of Dorigen he tolde him als,°
How looth hir° was to been a wikked wif,
And that she lever had° lost that day hir lif,
And that hir trouth she swoor° thurgh innocence:
“She nevere erst herd speke of apparence;°
That maad me han of hir so greet pitee.
And right as frely as he sente hir me,°
As frely sente I hir to him agein.
This al and som,° ther is namoor to sein.”

¶This philosophre answerd, “Leve° brother,
Everich of yow did gentilly til other.
Thou art a squier, and he is a knight;
But God forbede, for his blisful might,
But if° a clerk coud doon a gentil dede
As wel as any of yow, it is no drede!°
Sire, I relesse° thee thy thousand pound,
As thou right now wer crope° out of the ground
Ne nevere er now ne haddest knowen° me,
For sire, I wol nat take a peny of° thee
For al my craft, ne noght° for my travaille.°
Thou hast ypaied wel for my vitaille;°
It is ynogh, and farwel, have good day”:
And took his hors, and forth he gooth his way.

¶Lordings, this question wolde I aske now,
Which was the moste free,° as thinketh yow?°
Now telleth me, er that ye ferther wende.°
I can namoor,° my tale is at an ende.
