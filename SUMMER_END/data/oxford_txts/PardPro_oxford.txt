¶Our Hoste gan to swere as he° were wood,°
“Harrow!”° quod he, “by nailes and by blood!
This was a fals cherl° and a fals justise!°
As shamful deeth as herte may devise°
Come to thise juges and hir advocats!°
Algate° this sely° maide is slain, allas!
Allas! to dere° boghte° she beautee!
Wherfore I seye al day,° as men may see,
That yiftes° of fortune or of nature
Ben cause of deeth to many a creature.
Hir beautee was hir deeth, I dar wel sayn;
Allas! so pitously as she was slain!
Of bothe yiftes that I speke of now
Men han ful ofte more harm than prow.°
But trewely, min owene maister dere,
This is a pitous tale for to here.

¶“But natheles, passe over,° is no fors;°
I prey to God, so save° thy gentil° cors,°
And eek thine urinals° and thy jordanes,°
Thin ipocras,° and eek thy galianes,°
And every boist° ful of thy letuarie;°
God blesse hem, and our lady Seint Marie!
So mot I theen,° thou art a propre° man,
And lik a prelat,° by Seint Ronian!
Seide I nat wel? I can nat speke in terme;°
But wel I woot, thou doost° my hert to erme,°
That I almost have caught a cardinacle.°
By corpus bones!° but° I have triacle,°
Or elles a draught° of moiste° and corny° ale,
Or but° I here anon° a mery tale,
Min herte is lost for° pitee of this maide.

¶“Thou bel ami,° thou Pardoner,” he seide,
“Tel us som mirthe° or japes° right anon.”
“It shall be doon,” quod he, “by Seint Ronion!
But first,” quod he, “heer at this ale stake°
I wol both drinke, and eten° of a cake.”°
And right anon the gentils° gonne crie,
“Nay! lat him telle us of no ribaudie;°
Tel us som moral thing, that we may lere°
Som wit,° and thanne wol we gladly here.”
“I graunte, ywis,” quod he, “but I mot thinke
Upon som honest° thing, whil that I drinke.”

¶“Lordings,” quod he, “in chirches whan I preche,
I peine me° to han an hautein° speche,
And ringe it out as round° as gooth a belle,
For I can al° by rote° that I telle.
My theme is alwey oon, and ever was—
‘Radix malorum est cupiditas.’°
First I pronounce° whennes that I come,
And than my bulles° shewe I, alle and somme.°
Our lige lordes° seel on my patente,°
That shewe I first, my body° to warente,°
That no man be so bold, ne preest ne clerk,
Me to destourbe of° Cristes holy werk;
And after that than° telle I forth my tales,
Bulles of popes and of cardinales,
Of patriarkes, and bishoppes I shewe;
And in Latin I speke a wordes fewe,
To saffron with° my predicacioun,°
And for to stire men to devocioun.

¶“Than shewe I forth my longe cristal stones,
Ycrammed° ful of cloutes° and of bones;
Reliks been they, as wenen° they echoon.°
Than have I in latoun° a sholder-boon
Which that was of an holy Jewes shepe.
‘Good men,’ seye I, ‘tak of my wordes kepe;°
If that this boon be wasshe in any welle,
If cow, or calf, or sheep, or oxe swelle
That any worm hath ete,° or worm° ystonge,°
Tak water of that welle, and wash his tonge,
And it is hool anon°; and forthermore,
Of pokkes° and of scabbe,° and every sore
Shal every sheep be hool, that of this welle
Drinketh a draughte;° tak kepe eek what I telle.
If that the goodman,° that the bestes oweth,°
Wol every wike,° er° that the cok him croweth,
Fastinge,° drinken of this welle a draughte,
As thilke° holy Jewe our eldres taughte,
His bestes° and his stoor° shal multiplie.
And, sirs, also it heleth jalousie;
For, though a man be falle in jalous rage,
Let maken° with this water his potage,°
And never shal he more his wif mistriste,°
Though he the sooth° of hir defaute° wiste;°
Al° had she taken preestes two or three.
Heer is a mitein° eek, that ye may see.
He that his hond wol putte in this mitein,
He shal have multiplying of his grein,
Whan he hath sowen, be it whete or otes,
So that° he offre pens,° or elles grotes.°
Good men and wommen, o° thing warne I yow,
If any wight° be in this chirche now,
That hath doon sinne horrible, that° he
Dar nat, for shame, of it yshriven° be,
Or any womman, be she yong or old,
That hath ymaad hir housbond cokewold,°
Swich folk shul have no power ne no grace
To offren to my reliks in this place.
And° whoso° findeth him out of swich blame,
He wol com up and offre in Goddes name,
And I assoille° him by the auctoritee
Which that by bulle ygraunted was to me.’

¶“By this gaude° have I wonne, yeer by yeer,
An hundred mark° sith° I was Pardoner.
I stonde lik a clerk° in my pulpet,
And whan the lewed° peple is doun yset,°
I preche, so as ye han herd bifore,
And telle an hundred false japes° more.
Than peine I° me to strecche forth the nekke,
And est and west upon the peple I bekke,°
As doth a dowve° sitting on a berne.°
Min hondes and my tonge goon so yerne,°
That it is joy to see my bisinesse.°
Of avarice and of swich cursednesse°
Is al my preching, for to make hem free°
To yeve° her pens,° and namely° unto me.
For my entente is nat but° for to winne,°
And no thing° for correccioun of sinne.
I rekke never,° whan that they ben beried,°
Though that her soules goon ablakeberied!°
For certes, many a predicacioun°
Comth ofte time of ivel entencioun,
Som for plesaunce of° folk and flaterie,
To been avaunced° by ipocrisie,
And som for veine glorie,° and som for hate.
For, whan I dar non other weyes° debate,
Than wol I stinge him with my tonge smerte°
In preching, so that he shal nat asterte°
To been defamed falsly, if that he
Hath trespased° to my brethren or to me.
For, though I telle noght his propre name,
Men shal wel knowe that it is the same
By signes and by othere circumstances.
Thus quite° I folk that doon us displesances;°
Thus spitte I out my venim under hewe°
Of holinesse, to seme holy and trewe.

¶“But shortly min entente I wol devise;°
I preche of nothing but for coveitise.°
Therfor my theme is yet, and ever was—
Radix malorum est cupiditas.
Thus can I preche again° that same vice
Which that I use, and that is avarice.
But, though myself be gilty in that sinne,
Yet can I maken other folk to twinne°
From avarice, and sore° to repente.
But that is nat my principal entente.
I preche no thing but for coveitise;
Of this matere it oughte ynogh suffise.
Than telle I hem ensamples° many oon
Of olde stories, longe time agoon:
For lewed° peple loven tales olde;
Swich thinges can they wel reporte° and holde.°
What? trowe ye,° the whiles° I may preche,
And winne gold and silver for° I teche,
That I wol live in povert° wilfully?°
Nay, nay, I thoghte it never trewely!
For I wol preche and begge in sondry° londes;
I wol not do no labour with min hondes,
Ne make baskettes for to live therby,
Because I wol nat beggen idelly.°
I wol non of the apostles counterfete;°
I wol have money, wolle,° chese, and whete,
Al were it yeven of° the povrest page,°
Or of the povrest widwe in a village,
Al sholde hir children° sterve° for famine.
Nay! I wol drinke licour of the vine,°
And have a joly wenche° in every toun.

¶“But herkneth, lordings, in conclusioun;
Your liking° is that I shal telle a tale.
Now, have I dronke a draughte° of corny° ale,
By God, I hope I shal yow telle a thing
That shal, by resoun,° been at your liking.°
For, though myself be a ful vicious° man,
A moral tale yet I yow telle can,
Which I am wont° to preche, for to winne.
Now hold your pees,° my tale I wol beginne.”
