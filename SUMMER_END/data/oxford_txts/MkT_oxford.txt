I wol biwaile in maner of tragedie
The harm of hem that stode in heigh degree,
And fill° so ther nas no remedie
To bringe hem out of hir adversitee;
For certein, whan that fortune list° to flee,
Ther may no man the cours of hir withholde;°
Lat no man truste on blind prosperitee;
Be war by thise ensamples trewe and olde.

At Lucifer, though he an angel were,
And nat a man, at him I wol biginne;
For, thogh fortune may non° angel dere,°
From heigh degree yet fel he for his sinne
Doun into helle, wher he yet is inne.
O Lucifer! brightest of angels alle,
Now artow° Sathanas,° that maist nat twinne°
Out of miserie, in which that thou art falle.°

Lo Adam, in the feld of Damassene,°
With Goddes owene finger wroght° was he,
And nat bigeten of° mannes sperme unclene,
And welte° al Paradis, saving° o° tree.
Had never worldly man so heigh degree
As Adam, til he for misgovernaunce°
Was drive° out of his hie prosperitee
To labour, and to helle, and to meschaunce.°

Lo Sampson, which that was annunciat°
By th’angel, longe er his nativitee,
And was to God almighty consecrat,°
And stood in noblesse, whil° he mighte° see.
Was never swich another as was he,
To speke of strengthe, and therwith hardinesse;°
But to his wives° tolde he his secree,°
Through which he slow° himself, for wrecchednesse.

Sampson, this noble almighty champioun,
Withouten wepen° save his hondes tweie,
He slow and al torente° the leoun,
Toward his wedding walking by the weye.
His false wif coude him so plese and preye°
Til she his conseil knew, and she untrewe°
Unto his foos° his conseil gan biwreie,°
And him forsook,° and took another newe.

Three hundred foxes took Sampson for ire,
And alle hir° tailes he togider bond,°
And set the foxes tailes alle on fire,
For he on every tail had knit° a brond;°
And they brende al the cornes° in that lond,°
And alle hir oliveres° and vines eek.
A thousand men he slow eek with his hond,
And had no wepen but an asses cheek.°

Whan they were slain, so thursted him that he
Was wel ny° lorn,° for which he gan to preye
That God wolde on his peine° han som pitee,
And sende him drinke, or elles moste he deie;
And of this asses cheke, that was dreie,°
Out of a wangtooth° sprang anon a welle,°
Of which he drank ynogh,° shortly to seye,
Thus heelp him God, as Judicum° can telle.

By verrai° force, at Gazan,° on a night,
Maugree° Philistiens of that citee,
The gates of the toun he hath up plight,°
And on his bak ycaried hem hath he
Hie on an hille, that men mighte hem see.
O noble almighty Sampson, leef° and dere,
Had thou nat told to wommen thy secree,
In al this worlde ne hadde been° thy pere!

This Sampson never ciser° drank ne win,
Ne° on his heed cam rasour° noon ne shere,°
By precept° of the messager divin,
For alle his strengthes in his heres° were;
And fully twenty winter, yeer by yere,
He hadde of Israel the governaunce.°
But sone shal he wepen many a tere,
For wommen shal him bringen to meschaunce!°

Unto his lemman° Dalida he tolde
That in his heres al his strengthe lay,
And falsly to his fomen° she him solde.
And sleping in hir barme° upon a day
She made to clippe or shere° his heer awey,
And made his fomen al his craft° espien;°
And whan that they him fonde° in this array,°
They bounde him faste, and putten out his yën.

But er his heer were clipped or yshave,
Ther was no bond with which men might him binde;
But now is he in prisoun in a cave,
Wheras° they made him at the querne° grinde.
O noble Sampson, strongest of mankinde,
O whilom° juge° in glorie and in richesse,
Now maystow° wepen with thin yën blinde,
Sith thou fro wele° art falle in wrecchednesse.

Th’ende of this caitif° was as I shal seye;
His fomen° made a feste upon a day,
And made him as hir fool bifore hem pleye,
And this was in a temple of greet array.°
But atte laste he made a foul affray;°
For he two pilers° shook, and made hem falle,
And doun fil temple and al, and ther it lay,
And slow° himself, and eek his fomen alle.

This is to seyn, the princes everichoon,°
And eek three thousand bodies wer ther slain
With falling of the grete temple of stoon.
Of Sampson now wol I namore seyn.
Beth° war by this ensample old and plain
That no men telle hir conseil til° hir wives
Of swich thing as they wolde han secree° fain,°
If that it touche hir limmes° or hir lives.

Of Hercules the soverein° conquerour
Singen his workes laude° and heigh renoun;
For in his time of° strengthe he was the flour.°
He slow, and raft° the skin of the leoun;
He of Centauros leid the boost adoun;°
He Arpies slow, the cruel briddes° felle;°
He golden apples rafte of° the dragoun;
He drow° out Cerberus the hound of helle:

He slow the cruel tirant Busirus,
And made his hors to frete° him, flesh and boon;
He slow the firy serpent venimous;
Of Achelois two hornes, he brak° oon;
And he slow Cacus in a cave of stoon;
He slow the geaunt Antheus the stronge;
He slow the grisly° boor, and that anoon,
And bar° the heven on his nekke longe.

Was never wight,° sith that this world bigan,
That slow so many monstres as dide he.
Thurghout this wide world his name ran,
What for his strengthe, and for his heigh bountee,°
And every reaume° wente he for to see.
He was so strong that no man mighte him lette;°
At both the worldes endes, seith Trophee,
In stede of boundes,° he a piler° sette.

A lemman° had this noble champioun,
That highte° Dianira, fresh as May;
And, as thise clerkes maken mencioun,°
She hath him sent a sherte° fresh and gay.
Allas! this sherte, allas and weilaway!°
Envenimed° was so subtilly° withalle,
That, er that he had wered° it half a day,
It made his flesh al from his bones falle.

But nathelees som clerkes hir excusen
By oon° that highte° Nessus, that it maked;
Be as be may, I wol hir noght accusen;
But on his bak this sherte he wered° al naked,
Til that his flesh was for the venim blaked.°
And whan he sey° noon other remedie,
In hote coles he hath himselven raked,°
For with no venim deined him° to die.

Thus starf° this worthy mighty Hercules;
Lo, who may truste on fortune any throwe?°
For him that folweth al this world of prees,°
Er he be war,° is ofte yleid° ful lowe.
Ful wis is he that can himselven knowe.
Beth war, for whan that fortune list° to glose,°
Than waiteth° she hir man to overthrowe
By swich a wey as he wold leest suppose.

The mighty trone,° the precious tresor,
The glorious ceptre° and royal magestee
That had the king Nabugodonosor,
With tonge unnethe° may discrived be.
He twies wan Jerusalem the citee;
The vessel of the temple he with him ladde.°
At Babiloine was his soverein° see,°
In which his glorie and his delit° he hadde.

The fairest children of the blood royal
Of Israel he leet do gelde° anoon,
And maked° ech of hem to been his thral.°
Amonges other Daniel was oon,
That was the wisest child of everichoon;°
For he the dremes of the king expouned,°
Wheras in Chaldey° clerk ne was ther noon
That° wiste° to what fin° his dremes souned.°

This proude king leet make° a statue of golde,
Sixty cubites° long, and seven in brede,°
To which image bothe yonge and olde
Comaunded he to loute,° and have in drede;°
Or in a fourneis° ful of flambes rede
He shal be brent,° that° wolde noght obeie.
But never wolde assente to that dede
Daniel, ne his yonge felawes° tweie.

This king of kinges proud was and elaat,°
He wende° God, that sit in magestee,
Ne mighte him nat bireve of° his estaat:
But sodeinly he loste his dignitee,
And lik a beste° him semed for to be,
And eet hay as an oxe, and lay theroute;°
In rein with wilde bestes walked he,
Til certein time was ycome aboute.

And lik an egles fetheres wexe° his heres,
His nailes lik a briddes° clawes were;
Til God relessed° him a certein° yeres,
And yaf° him wit;° and than with many a tere
He thanked God, and ever his lif° in fere°
Was he to doon amis,° or more trespace;°
And, til that time he leid was on his bere,°
He knew° that God was ful of might and grace.

His sone, which that highte° Balthasar,
That heeld the regne° after his fader day,
He by his fader coude nought be war,°
For proud he was of herte and of array;°
And eek an idolastre° was he ay.
His hie estaat assured him° in pride.
But fortune caste him doun, and ther he lay,
And sodeinly his regne° gan divide.

A feste° he made unto° his lordes alle
Upon a time, and bad hem blithe° be,
And than his officeres gan he calle—
“Goth° bringeth forth° the vessels,” tho quod he,
“Which that my fader, in his prosperitee,
Out of the temple of Jerusalem birafte,°
And to our hye Goddes thanke we
Of° honour, that our eldres with us lafte.”°

His wif, his lordes, and his concubines
Ay dronken,° whil hir appetites laste,°
Out of thise noble vessels sundry° wines;
And on a wal this king his yën caste,
And sey° an hond armlees,° that wroot ful faste,
For fere of which he quook° and siked sore.°
This hond, that Balthasar so sore° agaste,°
Wroot “Mane, techel, phares,” and namore.

In al that lond magicien was noon
That coude expoune what this lettre° mente;
But Daniel expouned it anoon,°
And seide, “King, God to thy fader lente°
Glorie and honour, regne,° tresour, rente:°
And he was proud, and nothing God ne dradde,°
And therfor God gret wreche° upon him sente,
And him biraft° the regne° that he hadde.

He was out cast of mannes companie,
With asses was his habitacioun,
And eet hey° as a beste° in weet° and drie,
Til that he knew, by grace and by resoun,
That God of heven hath dominacioun°
Over every regne and every creature;
And thanne had God of him compassioun,
And him° restored his regne and his figure.°

“Eek thou, that art his sone, art proud also,
And knowest al thise thinges verraily,°
And art rebel to God, and art his fo.
Thou drank eek of his vessels boldely;
Thy wif eek and thy wenches° sinfully
Dronke of the same vessels sondry° wines,
And heriest° false goddes cursedly;
Therfor to° thee yshapen° ful gret pine° is.

“This hand was sent from God, that on the walle
Wroot ‘mane, techel, phares,’ truste me;
Thy regne is doon, thou weyest noght° at alle;
Divided is thy regne, and it shal be
To Medes and to Perses yeven,”° quod he.
And thilke same night this king was slawe,°
And Darius occupieth his degree,°
Thogh he therto° had neither right ne lawe.

Lordinges, ensample heerby may ye take
How that in lordshipe is no sikernesse;°
For whan fortune wol a man forsake,
She bereth awey his regne and his richesse,
And eek his freendes, bothe more and lesse;°
For what man that° hath freendes thurgh fortune,
Mishap° wol make hem enemis, I gesse:
This proverbe is ful sooth° and ful commune.°

Cenobia,° of Palimerie° quene,
As writen Persiens of hir noblesse,°
So worthy was in armes and so kene,°
That no wight passed hir in hardinesse,°
Ne in linage,° ne in other gentillesse.°
Of kinges blode of Perse° is she descended;
I seye nat that she hadde most fairnesse,°
But of hir shap she might nat been amended.°

From hir childhede I finde that she fledde
Office° of wommen, and to wood° she wente;
And many a wilde hertes blood she shedde
With arwes brode that she to hem sente.
She was so swift that she anon° hem hente,°
And whan that she was elder, she wold kille
Leouns, lepardes, and beres al torente,°
And in hir armes welde° hem at hir wille.

She dorste° wilde beestes dennes seke,
And rennen in the montaignes al the night,
And slepen under a bush, and she coude eke
Wrastlen by verray° force and verray might
With any yong man, were he never so° wight;°
Ther mighte nothing in hir armes stonde.°
She kepte° hir maidenhod° from every wight,
To no man deigned hir° for to be bonde.

But atte laste hir frendes han hir maried
To Odenake,° a prince of that contree,
Al were it so that° she hem longe taried;°
And ye shul understonde how that he
Had swiche fantasyes° as had she.
But nathelees, whan they were knit infere,°
They lived in joye and in felicitee;
For ech of hem hadde other° leef° and dere.

Save° o° thing, that she never wolde assente
By no wey, that he sholde by hir lie
But ones, for it was hir plein° entente°
To have a child, the world to multiplie;
And also sone as that she mighte espie°
That she was nat with childe with that dede,
Than wolde she suffre° him doon his fantasie°
Eft sone,° and nat but ones,° out of drede.°

And if she were with childe at thilke cast,°
Namore sholde he pleyen thilke° game
Til fully fourty dayes weren past;
Than wold she ones suffre him do the same.
Al were this Odenake wilde or tame,
He gat namore of hir, for thus she seide,
“It was to wives lecherie and shame
In other cas,° if° that men with hem pleide.”

Two sones by this Odenake had she,
The which° she kepte in vertu and lettrure;°
But now unto our tale turne we.
I sey, so worshipful° a creature,
And wis therwith, and large with mesure,°
So penible° in the warre, and curteis° eke,
Ne more labour mighte in werre endure,
Was noon, thogh al° this world men sholde seke.

Hir riche array ne mighte nat be told
As wel in vessel° as in hir clothing;
She was al clad in perree° and in gold,
And eek she lafte noght,° for noon hunting,
To have of sondry tonges° ful knowing,
Whan that she leiser hadde, and for to entende°
To lernen° bokes was al hir liking,°
How she in vertu mighte hir lif dispende.°

And, shortly of this process° for to trete,°
So doughty° was hir housbonde and eek she,
That they conquered many regnes° grete
In the Orient,° with many a fair citee,
Apertenaunt° unto the magestee
Of Rome, and with strong hond helde hem ful faste;
Ne never mighte hir fomen° doon° hem flee,
Ay whil that Odenakes dayes laste.

Hir batailes, whoso° list hem° for to rede,°
Again° Sapor the king and other mo,
And how that al this proces° fil in dede,
Why she conquered, what title had therto,
And after of hir meschief° and hir wo,
How that she was biseged and ytake,°
Let him unto my maister Petrark go,
That writ° ynough of this, I undertake.°

When Odenake was deed, she mightily°
The regnes heeld, and with hir propre° honde
Again hir foos she faught so cruelly,
That ther nas° king ne prince in al that londe
That he nas° glad, if he that grace° fonde,°
That she ne wolde upon his lond werreie;°
With hir they made alliaunce by bonde
To been in pees, and lete hir ride and pleye.

The emperour of Rome, Claudius,
Ne him bifore, the Romain Galien,
Ne dorste never° been so corageous,
Ne noon Ermin,° ne noon Egipcien,
Ne Surrien,° ne noon Arabien,
Within the feld that dorste° with hir fighte
Lest that she wolde hem with hir hondes slen,°
Or with hir meinee° putten hem to flighte.

In kinges habit° wente hir sones two,
As heires of hir fadres regnes° alle,
And Heremanno, and Thymalaö
Her names were, as Persiens hem calle.
But ay fortune hath in hir hony galle;°
This mighty quene may no whil° endure.
Fortune out of hir regne° made hir falle
To wrecchednesse and to misaventure.°

Aurelian, whan that the governaunce°
Of Rome cam into his hondes tweie,
He shoop° upon this queen to do vengeaunce,
And with his legiouns he took his weye
Toward Cenobie, and, shortly for to seye,
He made hir flee, and atte laste hir hente,°
And fettred hir,° and eek hir children tweie,
And wan the lond, and hoom to Rome he wente.

Amonges othere thinges that he wan,°
Hir char,° that was with gold wrought° and perree,°
This grete Romain, this Aurelian,
Hath with him lad,° for that men sholde it see.
Biforen° his triumphe° walketh she
With gilte° cheines on hir nekke hanging;
Corouned was she, as after° hir degree,
And ful of perree charged° hir clothing.

Allas, fortune! she that whilom° was
Dredful° to kinges and to emperoures,
Now gaureth° al the peple on hir, allas!
And she that helmed° was in starke° stoures,°
And wan by force tounes stronge and toures,
Shal on hir heed now were a vitremite;°
And she that bar the ceptre ful of floures°
Shal bere a distaf,° hir cost for to quite.°

Although that Nero were as vicious
As any feend° that lith° ful lowe adoun,
Yet he, as telleth us Suetonius,
This wide world hadde in subjeccioun,°
Both Est and West, South and Septemtrioun;°
Of rubies, saphires, and of perles white
Were alle his clothes brouded° up and doun;
For he in gemmes greetly gan delite.°

More delicat,° more pompous° of array,
More proud was never emperour than he;
That ilke° cloth, that he had wered° o° day,
After that time he nolde it never see.°
Nettes° of gold thred hadde he gret plentee°
To fisshe in Tibre, whan him liste° pleye.
His lustes° were al lawe in his decree,
For fortune as his freend him wolde obeye.

He Rome brent° for his delicacie;°
The senatours he slow° upon a° day.
To here how men wolde wepe and crie;
And slow his brother, and by his sister lay.
His moder made he in pitous array;°
For he hir wombe slitte, to biholde
Wher he conceived was; so weilawey!°
That he so litel of his moder tolde!°

No tere out of his eyen for that sighte
Ne cam, but seide, “A fair womman was she.”
Gret wonder is, how that he coude or mighte
Be domesman° of hir ded beautee.
The win° to bringen him comaunded he,
And drank anon; non other wo he made.
Whan might is joined unto crueltee,
Allas! to depe wol the venim wade!°

In youthe a maister° had this emperour,
To teche him letterure° and curteisie,
For of moralitee he was the flour,
As in his time, but if° bokes lie;
And whil this maister hadde of him maistrie,
He maked him so conning° and so souple°
That longe time it was er tirannie
Or any vice dorste on him uncouple.°

This Seneca, of which° that I devise,°
By cause Nero hadde of him swich drede,°
For he fro vices wolde him ay chastise°
Discreetly as by° worde and nat by dede;—
“Sir,” wolde he seyn, “an emperour moot nede°
Be vertuous, and hate tirannie”—
For which he in a bath made him to blede
On bothe his armes, til he moste die.

This Nero hadde eek of acustumaunce°
In youthe ageins° his maister for to rise,
Which afterward him thoughte a greet grevaunce;°
Therfor he made him deyen in this wise.°
But natheles this Seneca the wise
Chees° in a bath to deie in this manere
Rather than han another tormentise;°
And thus hath Nero slain his maister dere.

Now fil it so° that Fortune list no lenger°
The hye pride of Nero to cherice;°
For though that he were strong, yet was she strenger;
She thoughte thus, “By God, I am to nice°
To sette a man that is fulfild of° vice
In heigh degree, and emperour him calle.
By God, out of his sete I wol him trice;°
When he leest weneth,° sonest shal he falle.’

The peple roos upon him on a night
For his defaute,° and whan he it espied,
Out of his dores anon he hath him dight°
Alone, and, ther° he wende han ben allied,°
He knokked faste,° and ay the more he cried,
The faster shette they the dores alle;
Tho wiste he wel he had himself misgied,°
And wente his wey, no lenger dorste° he calle.

The peple cride and rombled° up and doun,
That with his eres herde he how they seide,
“Wher is this false tiraunt, this Neroun?”
For fere almost out of his wit he breide,°
And to his goddes pitously he preide
For socour, but it mighte nat bitide.°
For drede of this, him thoughte that he deide,
And ran into a gardin, him° to hide.

And in this gardin fond he cherles° tweie
That seten° by a fir° ful greet and reed,
And to thise cherles two he gan to preye
To sleen him, and to girden of° his heed,
That to his body, whan that he were° deed,
Were no despit° ydoon, for° his defame.
Himself he slow,° he coud° no better reed,°
Of which fortune lough, and hadde a game.

Was never capitain under a king
That regnes° mo putte in subjeccioun,
Ne strenger was in feeld of alle° thing,
As in his time, ne gretter of renoun,
Ne more pompous° in heigh presumpcioun
Than Oloferne, which Fortune ay kiste°
So likerously,° and ladde him up and doun
Til that his heed was of, er that° he wiste.

Nat only that this world hadde him in awe
For lesinge of° richesse or libertee,
But he made every man reneie° his lawe.°
“Nabugodonosor was god,” seide he,
“Noon other god ne sholde adoured° be.”
Ageins his heste° no wight dar trespace°
Save° in Bethulia, a strong citee,
Wher Eliachim a prest was of that place.

But tak kepe of° the deeth of Olofern;
Amidde his host he dronke lay a° night,
Withinne his tente, large as is a bern,°
And yit, for al his pompe and al his might,
Judith, a womman, as he lay upright,°
Sleping, his heed of smoot,° and from his tente
Ful prively° she stal° from every wight,
And with his heed unto hir toun she wente.

What nedeth it° of King Anthiochus
To telle his hye royal magestee,
His hye° pride, his werkes venimous?°
For swich another was ther noon as he.
Rede which that° he was in Machabee,°
And reed the proude wordes that he seide,
And why he fil° fro heigh prosperitee,
And in° an hil how wrechedly he deide.

Fortune him hadde enhaunced° so in pride
That verraily° he wende he mighte attaine°
Unto the sterres, upon every side,°
And in balance weien ech montaine,
And al the flodes of the see restraine.°
And Goddes peple hadde he most in hate,°
Hem° wolde he sleen in torment and in paine,
Wening° that God ne mighte his pride abate.°

And for that° Nichanor and Thimothee
Of° Jewes weren venquisshed mightily,
Unto° the Jewes swich an hate hadde he
That he bad greithe° his char° ful hastily,
And swoor, and seide, ful despitously,°
Unto Jerusalem he wolde° eftsone,°
To wreken his ire° on it ful cruelly;
But of° his purpos he was let° ful sone.

God for his manace° him so sore smoot°
With invisible wounde, ay incurable,
That in his guttes carf° it so and boot°
That his peines weren importable.°
And certeinly, the wrech° was resonable,
For many a mannes guttes dide he peine;°
But from his purpos cursed and dampnable
For al his smert° he wolde him nat restreine;

But bad anon apparaillen° his host,°
And sodeinly, er he of it was war,°
God daunted° al his pride and al his bost.
For he so sore° fil out of his char,°
That it his limes and his skin totar,°
So that he neither mighte go ne ride,
But in a chayer° men aboute him bar,
Al forbrused,° bothe bak and side.

The wreche° of God him smoot so cruelly
That thurgh his body wikked wormes crepte;
And therwithal he stank so horribly,
That noon of al his meinee° that him kepte,°
Whether so he wook or elles slepte,
Ne mighte noght for° stink of him endure.
In this meschief he wailed and eek wepte,
And knew° God lord of every creature.

To al his host and to himself also
Ful wlatsom° was the stink of his careine;°
No man ne mighte him bere to ne fro.
And in this stink and this horrible peine
He starf° ful wrecchedly in° a monteine.°
Thus hath this robbour and this homicide,°
That made many a man to wepe and pleine,
Swich guerdon° as bilongeth unto° pride.

The storie of Alisaundre is so comune,°
That every wight that hath discrecioun°
Hath herd somwhat° or al of his fortune.
This wide world, as in conclusioun,°
He wan by strengthe, or for his hie renoun
They weren glad for pees unto him sende.
The pride of man and beste he leide adoun,°
Wherso° he cam, unto the worldes ende.

Comparisoun might never yit be maked
Bitwixe° him and another conquerour;
For al this world for drede of him hath quaked,
He was of knighthode and of fredom° flour;°
Fortune him made the heir of hir honour;
Save win and wommen, nothing mighte aswage°
His hie entente° in armes and labour;
So was he ful of leonin° corage.°

What preis° were it to him, though I yow tolde
Of Darius, and an hundred thousand mo,
Of kinges, princes, erles, dukes bolde,
Whiche he conquered, and broghte hem° into wo?
I seye, as fer° as man may ride or go,°
The world was his, what sholde I more devise?°
For though I write or told you evermo°
Of his knighthode, it mighte nat suffise.

Twelf yeer he regned, as seith Machabee;
Philippes sone of Macedoine° he was,
That first was king in Grece the contree.
O worthy gentil Alisaundre, allas!
That ever sholde fallen° swich a cas!°
Empoisoned of° thin owene folk thou were;
Thy sis° fortune hath turned into as;°
And yit for thee ne weep she never° a tere!

Who shal me yeven° teres to compleine°
The deeth of gentillesse and of fraunchise,°
That al the world welded° in his demeine,°
And yit him thoughte it mighte nat suffise?
So ful was his corage° of heigh emprise.°
Allas! who shal me helpe to endite°
False fortune, and poison to despise,
The whiche° two of al this wo I wite?°

By wisdom, manhede,° and by greet labour
Fro humble bed to royal magestee,
Up roos he, Julius the conquerour,
That wan° al th’occident° by lond and see,
By strengthe of hond, or elles by tretee,
And unto Rome made hem tributarie;°
And sitthe° of Rome the emperour was he,
Til that fortune wex° his adversarie.
O mighty Cesar, that in Thessalie
Agein° Pompeius, fader thin in lawe,°
That of th’orient° hadde al the chivalrie°
As fer as that the day biginneth dawe,°
Thou thurgh thy knighthode hast hem take° and slawe,°
Save fewe folk that with Pompeius fledde,
Thurgh which thou puttest al th’orient in awe.
Thanke fortune, that so wel thee spedde!°

But now a litel whil I wol biwaille°
This Pompeius, this noble governour
Of Rome, which that fleigh at° this bataille;
I seye, oon of his men, a fals traitour,
His heed of smoot,° to winnen him° favour
Of° Julius, and him the heed he broghte.
Allas, Pompey, of th’orient conquerour,
That fortune unto swich a fin° thee broghte!

To Rome agein repaireth° Julius
With his triumphe,° laureat° ful hie,
But on a time° Brutus Cassius,
That ever° hadde of his hie estaat° envie,
Ful prively° hath maad conspiracie
Ageins this Julius, in subtil wise,
And cast° the place, in whiche he sholde die
With boidekins,° as I shal yow devise.°

This Julius to the Capitolie wente
Upon a day,° as he was wont° to goon,
And in the Capitolie anon° him hente°
This false Brutus, and his othere foon,
And stiked° him with boidekins anoon
With many a wounde, and thus they lete° him lie;
But never gronte° he at no strook but° oon,
Or elles at two, but if° his storie lie.

So manly was this Julius at herte
And so wel lovede estaatly honestee,
That, though his deedly woundes sore smerte,°
His mantel° over his hippes caste he,
For° no man sholde seen his privitee.°
And, as he lay on deying° in a traunce,
And wiste verraily that deed was he,
Of honestee° yit hadde he remembraunce.°

Lucan, to thee this storie I recomende,°
And to Sweton,° and to Valerie also,
That of this storie writen word and ende,°
How that to thise grete conqueroures two
Fortune was first freend, and sithen° fo.
No man ne truste° upon hir favour longe,
But have hir in await° for evermo.
Witnesse on° al thise conqueroures stronge.

This riche Cresus, whilom° king of Lide,°
Of whiche Cresus Cyrus sore him dradde,°
Yit was he caught amiddes° al his pride,
And to be brent° men to the fir him ladde.
But swich a rein doun fro the welkne° shadde°
That slow° the fir, and made him to escape;
But to be war° no grace° yet he hadde,
Til fortune on the galwes° made him gape.

Whan he escaped was, he can nat stente°
For to biginne a newe werre° again.
He wende° wel, for that° fortune him sente
Swich hap,° that he escaped thurgh the rain,
That of° his foos he mighte nat be slain;
And eek a sweven° upon a° night he mette,°
Of which he was so proud and eek so fain,°
That in vengeaunce he al his herte sette.

Upon a tree he was, as that him thoughte,°
Ther Juppiter him wesh,° bothe bak and side,
And Phebus eek a fair towaille° him broughte
To drie him with, and therfor wex° his pride;
And to his doghter, that stood him biside,°
Which that he knew in heigh° science habounde,°
He bad hir telle him what it signifide,
And she his dreem bigan right thus° expounde.

“The tree,” quod she, “the galwes is to mene,°
And Juppiter bitokneth° snow and rein,
And Phebus, with his towaille so clene,
Tho° ben the sonne stremes for to seyn;°
Thou shalt anhanged° be, fader, certein;
Rein shal thee wasshe, and sonne shal thee drie”;
Thus warned she him ful plat and ful plein,°
His doughter, which that° called was Phanie.

Anhanged was Cresus, the proude king,
His royal trone mighte him nat availle.°
Tragedies noon other maner° thing,
Ne can in singing crye ne biwaille,
But for that° fortune alwey wol assaille°
With unwar° strook° the regnes that ben proude;
For when men trusteth hir, than wol she faille,
And covere hir brighte face with a cloude.
