The lif so short the craft so long to lerne,
Th’assay° so sharp,°so hard the conqueringe,
The dredful° joy that alwey slit so yerne,°
Al this mene I by Love, that my felinge
Astonieth° with his wonderful worching°
So sore° ywis,° that whan I on him thinke,
Nat wot I wel wher that I flete° or sinke.
For al be° that I know nat love in dede,°
Ne wot° how that he quiteth folk hir hire,°
Yet happeth° me ful ofte in bokes rede
Of his miracles and his cruel ire;°
Ther rede I wel he wol be lord and sire,
I dar not seyn, his strokes° been so sore,
But° God save swich a lord! I can no more.°
Of usage what for luste what for lore,°
On bokes rede I ofte, as I yow tolde.
But wherfor° that I speke° al this? Not yore°
Agon, it happed° me for to beholde
Upon° a bok, was write with lettres olde;
And therupon a certein thing to lerne,
The longe day ful faste° I radde and yerne.°
 
For out of olde feldes,° as men sey,
Cometh al this newe corn° fro yeer to yere;
And out of olde bokes, in good fey,°
Cometh al this newe science° that men lere.°
But now to purpos as of this matere—
To rede forth so gan me to delite,
That al that day me thoughte° but a lite.
 
This book of which I make of mencioun,
Entitled was al thus, as I shal telle,
“Tullius° of the dreme of Scipioun.”
Chapitres seven it hadde, of hevene and helle,
And erthe, and soules that therin dwelle,
Of whiche, as shortly° as I can it trete,°
Of his sentence° I wol you seyn the grete.°
 
First telleth it, whan Scipion was come
In Afrik, how he met Massinisse,
That him for joye in armes hath ynome.°
Than telleth it hir speche and al the blisse°
That was betwix° hem, til the day gan misse;°
And how his auncestre, African so dere,
Gan in his slep that night to him appere.
 
Than telleth it that fro a sterry place,°
How African hath him Cartage shewed,
And warned him beforn of al his grace°
And seide him,° what man, lered other lewed,°
That loveth comun profit,° wel ythewed,°
He shuld unto a blisful place wende,°
Ther as° joye is that last withouten ende.
 
Than asked he, if folk that now ben dede
Have lif and dwelling in another place;
And African seide, “Ye, withouten drede,”°
And that our present worldes lives space
Nis but a maner deth,° what wey we trace,°
And rightful folk shal go, after they die,
To heven; and shewed him the galaxie.
 
Than shewed he him the litel erth, that heer is,
At regard of° the hevenes quantite;
And after shewed he him the nine speres,°
And after that the melodie herde he
That cometh of thilke° speres thryes three,
That welle is of musik and melodie
In this world here, and cause of armonie.
 
Than bad he him, sin° erthe was so lite,
And ful of torment and of harde grace,°
That he ne shulde him in the world delite.
Than tolde he him, in certein yeres space,
That every ster° shuld come into his place
Ther it was first; and al shulde out of minde°
That in this worlde is don of al mankinde.
 
Than praide him Scipioun to telle him al
The wey to come into that hevene blisse;°
And he seide, “Know thyself first° immortal,
And loke ay besily thou werke and wisse°
To comun profit, and thou shalt not misse°
To comen swiftly to that place dere,°
That ful of blisse is and of soules clere.°
 
But brekers of the lawe, soth to seyne,°
And likerous° folk, after that they be dede,
Shul alwey whirle aboute the erthe in peine,
Til many a world be passed, out of drede,°
And than, foryeven alle hir wikked dede,
Than shul they come unto that blisful place,
To which to comen God thee sende his grace!”
 
The day° gan failen and the derke night,
That reveth° bestes° from her besinesse,°
Berafte me° my book for lakke of light,
And to my bedde I gan me for to dresse,°
Fulfild of thought° and besy hevinesse;°
For bothe I hadde thing which that I nolde,°
And eek° I ne had that thing that I wolde.°
 
But finally my spirit, at the laste,
Forwery° of my labour al the day,
Took rest, that made me to slepe faste,°
And in my slepe I mette,° as that I lay,
How African, right in the selfe aray°
That Scipioun him saw before that tide,°
Was come and stood right at my bedes side.
 
The wery hunter slepinge in his bed,
To wode° ayein his minde goth anoon;°
The juge dremeth how his plees° ben sped;°
The carter dremeth how his cart is goon;
The riche, of gold; the knight fight with his foon;°
The seke met° he drinketh of the tonne;°
The lover met he hath his lady wonne.
 
Can I nat seyn if that the cause were
For° I had red of African beforn,
That made me to met° that he stood there;
But thus seide he, “Thou hast thee so wel born°
In loking of min olde book totorn,°
Of which Macrobie roghte° nat a lite,°
That somdel° of thy labour wolde I quite!”°—
 
Citherea! thou blisful lady swete,
That with thy firbrand° dauntest whom thee lest,°
And madest me this sweven° for to mete,°
Be thou my help in this, for thou mayst best;
As wisly° as I saw thee north-north-west,
When I began my sweven for to write,
So yif me might to rime and ek t’endite!°
 
This forseid African me hente° anoon,
And forth with him unto a gate broghte
Right of a parke, walled of grene stoon;
And over the gate, with lettres large ywroghte,°
Ther weren vers° ywriten, as me thoghte,
On either halfe,° of ful gret difference,
Of which I shal yow sey the plein sentence.°
 
“Thorgh me men goon° into that blisful place
Of hertes hele° and dedly woundes cure;
Thorgh me men goon unto the welle° of Grace,
Ther grene and lusty° May shal ever endure;
This is the wey to al good aventure;°
Be glad, thou reder, and thy sorwe ofcaste,°
Al open am I; passe in, and hi the faste!”°
 
“Thorgh me men goon,” than spak that other side,
“Unto the mortal strokes of the spere,°
Of which Disdain and Daunger° is the gide,
Ther tre shal never fruit ne leves bere.
This streem yow ledeth to the sorwful were,°
Ther as the fish in prison is al drie;
Th’eschewing° is only the remedie.”
 
Thise vers of gold and blak ywriten were,
Of whiche I gan astouned° to beholde,
For with that oon encresed ay my fere,
And with that other gan min herte bolde;°
That oon me het,° that other did me colde,°
No wit had I, for° errour, for to chese
To entre or flee, or me to save or lese.
 
Right as, betwixen adamauntes° two
Of even might, a pece of iren° yset
That hath no might to meve to ne fro—
For what that on° may hale,° that other let°—
Ferde I; that niste° whether me was bet,
To entre or leve, til African my gide
Me hente, and shoof° in at the gates wide,
 
And seide, “It stondeth writen in thy face,
Thin errour, though thou telle it not to me;
But dred the nat to come into this place,
For this writing nis nothing ment by thee,°
Ne by noon, but he Loves servant be;°
For thou of love hast lost thy tast,° I gesse,
As seek° man hath of swete and bitternesse.
 
But natheles, although that thou be dulle,
Yit that thou canst not do, yit mayst thou see;
For many a man that may not stonde° a pulle,°
Yit liketh him at wrastling for to be,
And demeth° yit wher he do bet° or he;
And if thou haddest cunning for t’endite,°
I shal thee shewen mater of to write.”°
 
With that my hond he took in his anoon,
Of which I comfort caughte, and went in faste;°
But Lord! so I was glad and wel begoon!°
For overal, wher I min eyen caste,
Were trees clad with leves that ay shal laste,
Eche in his kinde,° of colour fresh and grene
As emeraud,° that joye was to sene:
 
The bilder° ook, and eek the hardy asshe;
The piler° elm, the cofre° unto careine;°
The boxtree piper;° holm° to whippes lasshe;
The sailing fir;° the cipres, deth to pleine;°
The sheter ew,° the asp for shaftes° pleine;
The olive of pees, and eek° the drunken vine,
The victor palm, the laurer to devine.°
 
A gardin saw I, ful of blosmy bowes,°
Upon a river, in a grene mede,°
Ther as swetnesse evermore ynow is,
With floures white, blew, yelowe, and rede;
And colde welle-stremes, nothing dede,°
That swommen ful of smale fisshes lighte,
With finnes rede and scales silver-brighte.
 
On every bough the briddes herde I singe,
With vois of aungel in hir armonie,
Som besied hem° hir briddes° forth to bringe;
The litel conies° to hir pley gunne hie.°
And further al aboute I gan espie
The dredful roo, the buk,° the hert and hinde°
Squerels, and bestes smale of gentil kinde.°
 
Of instruments of strenges in accord°
Herde I so pleye and ravisshing swetnesse,
That God, that maker is of al and lord
Ne herde never better, as I gesse;
Therwith a wind, unnethe° it might be lesse°
Made in the leves grene a noise so softe
Acordaunt to° the briddes songe onlofte.
 
The air of that place so attempre° was
That never was grevaunce° of hoot ne cold;
Ther wex° eek every holsum spice and gras,
Ne no man may ther wexe° seek° ne old;
Yet was ther joy more than a thousand fold
Than man can telle; ne never wolde it nighte,°
But ay° cleer day to any mannes sighte.
 
Under a tree, beside a welle,° I say°
Cupide our lord his arwes forge and file;
And at his fete his bowe al redy lay,
And Wille° his doghter tempred al this while
The hedes° in the welle, and with hir file
She couched hem° after as they shuld serve,°
Som for to slee,° and som to wounde and kerve.°
 
Tho was I war of Plesaunce anonright,°
And of Aray,° and Lust,° and Curtesie,
And of the Craft° that can and hath the might
To doon° by force a wight° to do folie—
Disfigurat° was she, I nil not lie;
And by himself, under an oke, I gesse,°
Saw I Delit, that stood with Gentilnesse.°
 
I saw Beautee, withouten any atir,°
And Youthe, ful of game and jolite,
Foolhardinesse, Flatery, and Desir,
Messagerie,° and Mede,° and other three—
Hir names shul noght here be told for me—
And upon pilers grete of jasper° longe°
I saw a temple of bras yfounded stronge.°
 
About the temple daunceden alway
Wommen ynowe,° of whiche som ther were
Faire of hemself,° and somme of hem were gay;°
In kirtels,° al disshevele,° went they there—
That was hir office° always, yeer by yere—
And on the temple, of doves white and faire
Saw I sittinge many a hundred paire.
 
Before the temple dore ful soberly
Dame Pees sat, with a curtein in hir hond:
And by hir side, wonder discretly,
Dame Pacience sitting ther I fond
With face pale, upon an hille of sond;
And aldernext, within and eek withoute,°
Behest° and Art, and of hir folke a route.°
 
Within the temple, with sighes° hote as fir
I herde a swogh° that gan aboute renne;°
Which sighes were engendred with° desir,
That maden every auter° for to brenne°
Of newe flaume; and wel aspied I thenne
That al the cause of sorwe° that they drie°
Cam of the bitter goddesse Jalousie.
 
The god Priapus saw I, as I wente,
Within the temple, in soverain° place stonde,
In swich aray° as whan the asse him shente°
With crie by night, and with ceptre° in honde;
Ful besily men gunne assaye and fonde°
Upon his hede to sette, of sondry hewe°
Garlondes ful of floures fresshe newe.
 
And in a privee corner, in disporte,°
Fond I Venus and hir porter° Richesse,
That was ful noble and hautein of hir porte.°
Derk was that place, but afterward lightnesse
I saw a lite, unnethe° it might be lesse,
And on a bed of gold she lay to reste,
Til that the hote sonne gan to weste.°
 
Hir gilte° heres with a golden threde
Ybounden were untressed° as she lay,
And naked fro the breste up to the hede
Men might hir see; and, sothly for to say,
The remenant was wel kevered to my pay°
Right with a subtil kerchef° of Valence,
Ther was no thikker cloth of no defence.°
 
The place yaf° a thousand savours swote,°
And Bachus, god of win, sat hir beside,
And Ceres next, that doth of hunger bote;°
And, as I seide, amiddes lay Cipride,°
To whom on knees two yonge folkes cride
To ben hir help; but thus I leet° hir lie,
And ferther in the temple I gan espie
 
That, in dispite° of Diane the chaste,
Ful many a bowe ybroke° heng on the wal
Of maidens, suche as gunne hir times waste
In hir servise; and peinted over al
Ful many a story, of which I touche shal
A fewe, as of Calixte° and Athalaunte,
And many a maide, of which the name I wante;°
 
Semiramus, Candace, and Ercules,
Biblis, Dido, Thisbe, and Piramus,
Tristram, Isoude, Paris, and Achilles,
Eleine, Cleopatre, and Troilus,
Silla,° and eek the moder of Romulus—
Al these were peinted on that other side,
And al hir love, and in what plite° they dide.
 
Whan I was come ayen° unto the place
That I of spak, that was so swote° and grene,
Forth welk° I tho, myselven to solace.
Tho was I war wher that ther sat a queen
That, as of light the somer sonne shene°
Passeth the sterre,° right so over mesure
She fairer was than any creature.
 
And in a launde,° upon an hille of floures,
Was set this noble goddesse of Nature;
Of braunches were hir halles and hir boures,°
Ywrought° after hir caste° and hir mesure;
Ne ther nas foul° that cometh of engendrure,°
That they ne were al prest° in hir presence,
To take hir doom° and yeve hir audience.°
 
For this was on Seint Valentines day,
Whan every brid cometh ther to chese his make,°
Of every kinde, that men thenke may;
And that so huge a noise gan they mak,
That erthe and air, and tree, and every lake
So ful was, that unnethe° was ther space
For me to stond, so ful was al the place.
 
And right as Alein, in the Pleint of Kinde,°
Deviseth° Nature in aray and face,
In swich aray men mighten hir ther finde.
This noble emperesse, ful of grace
Bad every foul to take his owne place,
As they were wont° alwey fro yeer to yere,
Seint Valentines day, to stonden there.
 
That is to seyn, the foules of ravine°
Were hyest set; and thanne foules smale,
That eten as hem Nature wolde encline,
As worm or thing of whiche I tell no tale;
And water-foul sat loweste in the dale;°
But foul that liveth by seed sat on the grene,
And that so fele,° that wonder was to sene.
 
There mighte men the royal egle finde,
That with his sharpe look perceth the sonne;
And other egles of a lower kinde,°
Of which that clerkes wel devisen cunne.°
Ther was the tiraunt with his fethres dunne°
And greye, I mene the goshauk, that doth pine°
To briddes for his outrageous ravine.°
 
The gentil faucoun,° that with feet distreineth°
The kinges hond; the hardy sperhauk° eke
The quailes foo;° the merlion° that paineth
Himself ful ofte, the larke for to seke;
Ther was the douve,° with hir eyen meke;°
The jalous° swan, ayens hir deth° that singeth;
The oule eek, that of dethe the bode° bringeth;
 
The crane geaunt,° with his trompes soune;°
The theef, the chogh;° and eek the jangling pie;°
The scorning jay; the eles° foo, heroune;
The false lapwing, ful of trecherie;
The starling, that the counseil° can bewreie;°
The tame ruddok;° and the coward kite;°
The cok, that orloge° is of thorpes lite;°
 
The sparow, Venus son; the nightingale,
That clepeth° forth the grene leves newe;
The swalow, mordrer° of the flies° smale
That maken hony of floures fresshe of hewe;
The wedded turtel,° with hir herte trewe;°
The pecok, with his aungels fethres brighte;
The fesaunt,° scorner of the cok by nighte;
 
The waker° goos; the cukkow most unkinde;°
The popinjay, ful of delicasie;°
The drake, stroyer° of his owne kinde;
The stork, the wreker° of avouterie;°
The hote cormeraunt of glotonie;
The raven wis, the crow with vois of care;°
The throstel° old; the frosty feldefare.°
 
What shulde I seyn? of foules every kinde
That in this world han fethres and stature,°
Men mighten in that place assembled finde
Before the noble goddesse of Nature
And everich of hem did his besy cure°
Benignely° to chese or for to take,
By hir acord, his formel° or his make.°
 
But to the point—Nature held on hir hond°
A formel egle, of shap the gentileste°
That ever she among hir werkes fonde,
The most benigne and the goodlieste;
In hir was every vertu at his reste,
So ferforth,° that Nature hirself had blisse
To loke on hir, and ofte hir bek° to kisse.
 
Nature, the vicarie° of th’almighty lorde,
That hoot, cold, hevy, light, and moist and dreie
Hath knit with even noumbre of acorde,
In esy vois gan for to speke and seye,
“Foules, tak hede of my sentence,° I preye,
And, for your ese, in furthering of your° nede,
As faste° as I may speke, I wol me spede.°
 
Ye know wel how, Seint Valentines day,
By my statut and through my governaunce,
Ye come for to chese—and flee your way—
Your makes, as I prik° yow with plesaunce.°
But natheles, my rightful ordenaunce
May I not breke, for al this world to winne,°
That he that most is worthy shal beginne.
 
The tercel° egle, as that ye know ful wel,
The foul royal above yow in degree,
The wise and worthy, secree,° trewe as stel,
The which I formed have, as ye may see,
In every part as it best liketh me,°
It nedeth noght his shap° yow to devise,°
He shal first chese and speken in his gise.°
 
And after him, by order shul ye chese,
After your kinde, everich as yow liketh,
And, as your hap° is, shul ye winne or lese;
But which° of yow that love most entriketh,°
God sende him hir that sorest for him siketh.”°
And therwithal the tercel gan she calle,
And seid, “My son the chois is to yow falle.
 
“But natheles, in° this condicioun
Mot° be the chois of everich that is here,
That she agree to his eleccioun,°
Whatso he be° that shulde be hir fere;°
This is our usage alwey fro yeer to yere;
And who so may at this time have his grace,°
In blisful time he cam into this place.”
 
With hed enclined and with ful humble chere
This royal tercel spak and taried nought:
“Unto my soverein lady, and noght my fere,°
I chese, and chese with wille and herte and thought,
The formel on your hond so wel ywrought,
Whos I am al and ever wol hir serve,
Do what hir list,° to do me live or sterve.°
 
“Beseching hir of mercy and of grace,
As she that is my lady sovereine;
Or let me dye present° in this place.
For certes, long I may not live in peine;
For in min herte is corven° every veine;
And havinge only reward° to my truthe°
My dere herte, have on my wo som routhe.°
 
“And if that I to hir be founde untrewe,°
Disobeisaunt, or wilful° negligent,
Avauntour,° or in proces° love a newe,
I pray to you this be my jugement,
That with° these foules I be al torent,°
That ilke° day that ever she me finde
To hir untrewe, or in my gilte unkinde.°
 
“And sin° that noon loveth hir so wel as I,
Al be° she never of love me behette,°
Than oghte she be min thourgh hir mercy,
For other bond can I noon on hir knette.°
For never, for no wo, ne shal I lette°
To serven hir, how fer so that she wende;°
Sey what yow list my tale is at an ende.”
 
Right as the fresshe, rede rose newe
Ayen° the somer sonne coloured is,
Right so for shame al wexen gan hire hewe°
Of this formel, whan that she herde al this;
She neither answerd wel ne seide amis°
So sore abasshed was she, til that Nature
Seid “Doghter, drede yow noght, I yow assure.”
 
Another tercel egle spak anoon
Of lower kinde,° and seid, “That shal nat be;
I love hir bet than ye do, by Seint Iohn,
Or atte leste I love as wel as ye;
And lenger have hir served, in my degree,°
And if she shulde have loved for long loving,
To me allone had been° the guerdoninge.°
 
“I dar eek seyn, if she me finde fals,
Unkinde,° jangler,° or rebel in any wise,
Or jalous, do me hongen° by the hals!°
And but I bere me° in hir servise
As wel as that my wit can me suffise,
From point to point,° hir honour for to save,
Tak she my lif, and al the good I have.”
 
The thridde tercel egle answerd tho,
“Now, sirs, ye seen the litel leiser° here;
For every foul cryeth out to been ago
Forth with his make, or with his lady dere;
And eek Nature hirself ne wol nought here,
For tarying here, noght half that I wold seye;
And but I speke,° I mot° for° sorwe deie.
 
“Of long servise avaunte I me nothing,°
But as possible is me to die today
For wo, as he that hath ben languisshing
Thise twenty winter, and wel happen may
A man may serven bet and more to pay°
In half a yere, although it were no more,
Than som man doth that hath served ful yore.°
 
“I sey not this by me° for I ne can
Do no servise that may my lady plese;
But I dar seyn, I am hir trewest man
As to my dome,° and feinest wolde hir ese;°
At shorte wordes, til that deth me sese,°
I wol ben hires, whether I wake or winke,°
And trewe in al that herte may bethinke.”
 
Of al my lif, sin that day I was born,
So gentil plee° in love or other thing
Ne herde never no man me beforn,
Whoso that hadde leiser and cunning°
For to reherse° hir chere° and hir speking;
And from the morwe gan this speche laste
Til dounward drow the sonne wonder faste.
 
The noise of foules for to ben delivered°
So loude rong, “Have doon and let us wende!”°
That wel wende° I the wode° had al toshivered.°
“Come of!”° they cride, “Allas! ye wil us shende!°
Whan shal your cursed pleding have an ende?
How shulde a juge either party leve,°
For yee or nay, withouten any preve?”°
 
The goos, the cokkow, and the doke also
So criden, “Kek kek!” “Kukkow!” “Quek quek!” hie,
That thorgh min eres the noise wente tho.
The goos seide, “Al this nis not worth a flie!
But I can shape° hereof a remedie,
And I wol sey my verdit° faire and swithe°
For° water-foul whoso be wroth or blithe.”°
 
“And I for worm-foul,” quod the fool° cukkow,
“And I wol, of min owne auctorite,
For comune profit,° take the charge° now,
For to delivere° us is gret charite.”
“Ye may abide a while yet, parde!”
Quod the turtel, “If it be your wille
A wight may speke him were as good be stille.°
 
“I am a seed-foul, oon the unworthieste°
That wot° I wel, and litel of kunninge;
But bet is that a wightes tonge reste
Than entermeten him° of such doinge°
Of which he neither rede° can nor singe.
And whoso doth, ful foule himself acloyeth,°
For office uncommitted° ofte anoyeth.”
 
Nature, which that alway had an ere
To murmour of the lewednes° behinde,
With facound° vois seid, “Hold your tonges there!
And I shal sone, I hope, a counseil° finde°
You to delivere, and fro this noise° unbinde;
I juge, of every folk men shal oon calle
To seyn the verdit° for you foules alle.”
 
Assented were to this conclusioun
The briddes alle; and foules of ravine
Han chosen first, by plein eleccioun,
The tercelet of the faucon, to diffine°
Al hir sentence,° and as him list,° termine;°
And to Nature him gonnen to presente,
And she accepteth him with glad entente.
 
The tercelet seid than in this manere:
“Ful hard were it to preve by resoun
Who loveth best this gentil formel here;
For everich hath swich replicacioun,°
That noon by skilles° may be broght adoun;
I can not seen that argumentes availe;
Than semeth it ther moste be bataile.”
 
“Al redy!” quod these egles tercels tho.
“Nay sirs!” quod he, “if that I dorste° it seye,
Ye doon me wrong, my tale° is not ydo!°
For sirs, ne taketh noght agref,° I preye,
It may noght gon, as ye wolde, in this weye;
Oures is the vois that han the charge on honde,°
And to the juges dome ye moten stonde;°
 
“And therfor, pees! I seye, as to my wit
Me wolde think how that the worthieste
Of knighthode, and lengest hath used it,
Moste of estat, of blode the gentileste,
Were sittingest° for hir, if that hir leste;°
And of these three she wot° hirself, I trowe,°
Which that he be, for it is light° to knowe.”
 
The water-foules han her hedes leid
Togedre, and of a short avisement,°
Whan everich had his large golee° seid,
They seiden sothly, al by oon assent,
How that “The goos, with hir facounde gent,°
That so desireth to pronounce our nede,°
Shal telle our tale” and preide “God hir spede.”
 
And for these water-foules tho began
The goos to speke, and in hir cakelinge
She seide, “Pees! now tak kepe° every man,
And herkeneth° which a reson I shal bringe;
My wit is sharp, I love no taryinge;
I seye, I rede° him, though he were my brother,
But° she wol love him, lat him take another!”
 
“Lo here! a parfit reson of a goos!”
Quod the sperhauk; “Never mot she thee!°
Lo, swich it is to have a tonge loos!
Now parde, fool, yet were it bet for thee
Have hold thy pees, than shewen thy nicete!°
It lith not in his wit nor in his wille,
But sooth is seid, ‘A fool can noght be stille.’ ”
 
The laughtre aroos of gentil° foules alle,
And right anoon the seed-foul chosen hadde
The turtel trewe, and gunne hir to hem calle,
And preiden hir to sey he sothe sadde°
Of this matere, and asked what she radde;°
And she answerd, that pleinly hir entente
She wolde it shewe, and sothly what she mente.
 
“Nay, God forbede a lover shulde chaunge!”°
The turtle seide, and wex for shame al reed;
“Thogh° that his lady evermore be straunge,°
Yet let him serve hir, til that he be deed;
For sothe, I preise noght the gooses reed;°
For thogh she deied, I wold non other make,
I wol ben hires, til that the deth me take.”
 
“Wel bourded!”° quod the doke,° “By my hat!
That men shuld loven alwey causeles,
Who can a reson finde or wit in that?
Daunceth he mury° that is mirtheles?
Who shulde recche° of that is reccheles?”°
“Quek, quek!” yit seith the doke, ful wel and faire,
“There been mo sterres,° God wot, than a paire!”
 
“Now fy, cherl!”° quod the gentil tercelet,
“Out of the dunghil° com that word ful right,
Thou canst noght see what thing is wel beset:°
Thou farest by love as oules doon by light,
The day hem blent,° but wel they see by night;
Thy kind is of so lowe a wrechednesse,
That what love is, thou canst nat see ne gesse.”
 
Tho gan the cukkow putte him forth in prees°
For foul that eteth worm and seide blive,°
“So° I,” quod he, “may have my make° in pees,
I recche not° how longe that ye strive;
Lat ech of hem be solein° al hir lyve,
This is my reed,° sin they may not acorde;
This shorte lesson nedeth noght recorde.”
 
“Ye! have the glotoun° fild ynogh° his paunche,°
Than are we wel!” seid then a merlioun;
“Thou mordrer of the heisugge° on the braunche
That brought thee forth, thou rewthelees glotoun!
Live thou solein, wormes corrupcioun!
For no fors is of lakke of thy nature;°
Go, lewed° be thou, whil the world may dure!”°
 
“Now pees,” quod Nature, “I comaunde here;
For I have herd al your opinioun,
And in effect yet be we not the nere;°
But finally, this is my conclusioun,
That she hirself shal han the eleccioun
Of whom hir list,° whoso be wrooth or blithe,
Him that she cheest,° he shal hir have as swithe.°
 
For sith° it may not here discussed be
Who loveth hir best, as seid the tercelet,
Than wol I doon hir this favour, that she
Shal have right him on whom hir herte is set,
And he hir that his herte hath on hir knet.°
Thus juge I, Nature, for I may not lie;
To noon estat I have non other ye.°
 
But as for counseil for to chese a make,
If I were reson, certes, than wolde I
Counseile yow the royal tercel take,
As seid the tercelet ful skilfully,
As for the gentilest and most worthy,
Which I have wroght so wel to my plesaunce;
That to yow oght to been a suffisaunce.”
 
With dredful° vois the formel hir answerde,
“My rightful lady, goddesse of Nature,
Soth is that I am ever under your yerde,°
Lik as is everiche other creature,
And moot be youres whil that my lif may dure;
And therfor graunteth me my firste bone,°
And min entent° that wol I sey wel sone.”
 
“I graunte it you,” quod she; and right anon
This formel egle spak in this degree,°
“Almighty quene, unto° this yeer be gon°
I ask respit for to avisen me.°
And after that to have my chois al free;
This al and sum, that I wol speke and seye;
Ye gete no more, although ye do me deie.°
 
“I wol noght serven Venus ne Cupide
For sothe as yet, by no manere wey.”
“Now sin it may non other wise betide,”
Quod tho Nature, “here is no more to sey;
Than wolde I that these foules were awey
Ech with his make, for tarying lenger here”—
And seide hem thus, as ye shul after here.
 
“To you speke I, ye tercelets,” quod Nature,
“Beth of good herte and serveth, alle three;
A yeer is not so longe to endure,
And ech of yow peine him,° in his degree,
For to do wel; for, God wot, quit° is she
Fro yow this yeer; what after so befalle,
This entremes° is dressed° for you alle.”
 
And whan this werk al broght was to an ende
To every foule Nature yaf his make
By even acorde,° and on hir wey they wende.
But Lord! the blisse and joye that they make!
For ech gan other in his winges take,
And with hir nekkes ech gan other winde,°
Thanking alwey the noble queen of kinde.
 
But first were chosen foules for to singe,
As yeer by yere was alwey the usaunce°
To singe a roundel at hir departinge,
To do to Nature honour and plesaunce.
The note,° I trowe, ymaked° was in Fraunce;
The wordes wer swich as ye may heer finde,
The nexte vers, as I now have in minde.

[“Now welcom somer, with thy sonne softe,
That hast this wintres weders overshake,°
And driven awey the longe nightes blake!
 
“Saint Valentin, that art ful hi onlofte;—
Thus singen smale foules for thy sake—
Now welcom somer, with thy sonne softe,
That hast this wintres weders overshake.
 
“Wel han they cause for to gladen ofte,
Sith ech of hem recovered hath his make;
Ful blisful may they singen whan they wake;
Now welcom somer, with thy sonne softe,
That hast this wintres weders overshake,
And driven away the longe nightes blake.”]
 
And with the showting, whan the song was do,
That foules maden at hir flight away
I wook, and other bokes took me to
To rede upon, and yet I rede alway;
In hope, ywis, to rede so som day
That I shal mete° som thing for to fare
The bet; and thus to rede I nil not spare.°
