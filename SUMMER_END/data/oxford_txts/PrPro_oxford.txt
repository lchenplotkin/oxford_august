“O Lord our lord, thy nam° how merveillous
Is in this large worlde ysprad,”° quod she,
“For noght only thy laude° precious
Parfourned is by men of dignitee,
But by the mouth of children thy bountee°
Parfourned is, for on the brest soukinge°
Somtime shewen they thin heryinge.°

Wherfore in laude,° as I best can or may,°
Of thee, and of the white lily flour
Which that thee bar, and is a maide° alway,
To telle a storie I wol do my labour;
Not that I may encresen hir honour;
For she hirself is honour, and the rote°
Of bountee,° next hir sone, and soules bote.°

O moder maide! O maide moder free!°
O bush unbrent,° brenninge° in Moises sighte,
That ravishedest° doun fro the deitee,°
Thurgh thin humbless,° the goost° that in th’alighte,°
Of whos vertu,° whan he thin herte lighte,
Conceived was the fadres sapience,°
Help me to telle it in thy reverence!

Lady! thy bountee, thy magnificence,
Thy vertu, and thy grete humilitee
Ther may no tonge expresse in no science;°
For somtime, lady, er° men pray to thee,
Thou goost biforn° of thy benignitee,
And getest us° the light of thy preyere,
To giden us unto thy son so dere.

My conning° is so waik,° O blisful quene,
For to declare thy grete worthinesse,
That I ne may the weighte nat sustene,
But as a child of twelf monthe old, or lesse,
That can unnethes° any word expresse,
Right so fare I, and therfore I yow preye,
Gideth° my song° that I shal of yow seye.”°
