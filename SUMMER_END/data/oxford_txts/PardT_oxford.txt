¶In Flaundres whilom° was a companie
Of yonge folk, that haunteden° folie,
As riot,° hasard,° stewes,° and tavernes,
Wheras,° with harpes, lutes, and giternes,°
They daunce and pleye at dees° both day and night,
And ete also and drinke over hir might,°
Thurgh which they doon° the devel sacrifise
Within that develes temple, in cursed wise,
By superfluitee° abhominable;
Hir othes° been so grete and so dampnable,
That it is grisly° for to here hem swere;
Our blissed lordes body they totere;°
Hem thoughte° Jewes rente° him noght ynough;
And ech of hem at otheres sinne lough.°

¶And right anon than comen tombesteres°
Fetis° and smale, and yonge fruitesteres,°
Singers with harpes, baudes,° wafereres,°
Which been the verray develes officeres°
To kindle and blow the fir of lecherie,
That is annexed unto glotonie.
The holy writ° take I to my witnesse,
That luxurie° is in win and dronkenesse.
Lo, how that dronken Loth, unkindely,°
Lay by his doghtres two, unwitingly;°
So dronke he was, he niste° what he wroghte.°
Herodes (whoso° wel the stories soghte),
Whan he of win was replet° at his feste,°
Right at his owene table he yaf° his heste°
To sleen° the Baptist John ful giltelees.°
Senek° seith eek a good word doutelees;°
He seith, he can no difference finde
Bitwix a man that is out of his minde
And a man which that is dronkelewe,°
But that woodnesse,° yfallen° in a shrewe,°
Persevereth° lenger than doth dronkenesse.

¶O glotonie, ful of cursednesse,
O cause first of our confusioun,°
O original° of our dampnacioun,
Til Crist had boght° us with his blood again!
Lo, how dere, shortly for to sayn,
Aboght° was thilke cursed vileinie;°
Corrupt was al this world for glotonie!
Adam our fader, and his wif also,
Fro Paradis to labour and to wo
Were driven for that vice, it is no drede;°
For whil that Adam fasted, as I rede,°
He was in Paradis; and whan that he
Eet of the fruit defended° on the tree,
Anon he was outcast to wo and peine.
O Glotonie, on thee wel oghte us pleine!°
O, wiste a man° how many maladies
Folwen of excesse and of° glotonies,
He wolde been the more mesurable°
Of his diete, sittinge at his table.

¶Allas! the shorte throte, the tendre mouth,°
Maketh that, est and west and north and south,
In erthe, in eir, in water men toswinke°
To gete a glotoun deintee° mete° and drinke!
Of this matere, O Paul, wel canstow° trete,°
“Mete unto wombe, and wombe° eek unto mete,
Shal God destroyen bothe,” as Paulus seith.
Allas! a foul thing is it, by my feith,
To seye this word, and fouler is the dede,
Whan man so drinketh of the white° and rede,°
That of his throte he maketh his privee,°
Thurgh thilke cursed superfluitee.°
The apostel weping seith ful pitously,°
“Ther walken many of which yow told have I,
I seye it now weping with pitous vois,
Ther been enemis of Cristes crois,
Of which the ende is deeth, wombe is her° God.”

¶O wombe! O bely! O stinking cod,°
Fulfild° of donge and of corrupcioun!°
At either ende of thee foul is the soun.°
How greet labour and cost is thee to finde!°
Thise cokes,° how they stampe,° and streine, and grinde,
And turnen substaunce° into accident,°
To fulfille al thy likerous° talent!°
Out of the harde bones knokke° they
The mary,° for they caste noght° awey
That may go thurgh the golet° softe and swote;°
Of spicerie,° of leef, and bark, and rote°
Shal been his sauce ymaked by delit,°
To make him yet a newer appetit.
But certes, he that haunteth° swich delices°
Is deed whil that he liveth in tho vices.
A lecherous thing is win, and dronkenesse
Is ful of striving° and of wrecchednesse.
O Dronke man, disfigured is thy face,
Sour is thy breeth, foul artow° to embrace,
And thurgh thy dronke nose semeth the soun
As though thou seidest ay° “Sampsoun, Sampsoun”;
And yet, God wot,° Sampsoun drank never no win.
Thou fallest, as it were° a stiked swin;°
Thy tonge is lost, and al thin honest° cure;°
For dronkenesse is verray° sepulture°
Of mannes wit and his discrecioun.
In whom that drinke hath dominacioun,°
He can no conseil° kepe, it is no drede.
Now keep yow° fro the white and fro the rede,
And namely° fro the white win of Lepe,
That is to selle° in Fishstrete or in Chepe.
This win of Spaine crepeth subtilly
In othere wines, growing faste by,
Of which ther riseth swich fumositee,°
That whan a man hath dronken draughtes° three,
And weneth° that he be at hoom in Chepe,°
He is in Spaine, right at the toune of Lepe,
Nat at the Rochel ne at Burdeux toun;
And thanne wol he sey, “Sampsoun, Sampsoun.”

¶But herkneth, lordinges, o° word, I yow preye,
That all the soverein° actes, dar I seye,
Of victories in the Olde Testament,
Thurgh verray God,° that is omnipotent,
Were doon in abstinence and in preyere;
Loketh the Bible, and ther ye may it lere.°
Loke,° Attila, the grete conquerour,
Deide° in his sleep, with shame and dishonour,
Bledinge ay at his nose in dronkenesse;
A capitain shoulde live in sobrenesse.
And over al this, aviseth yow° right wel
What was comaunded unto Lamuel—
Nat Samuel, but Lamuel seye I—
Redeth the Bible, and finde it expresly
Of win-yeving° to hem that han justise.°
Namore of this, for it may wel suffise.

¶And now that I have spoke of glotonie,
Now wol I yow defenden° hasardrie.°
Hasard is verray° moder of lesinges,°
And of deceite, and cursed forsweringes,°
Blaspheme° of Crist, manslaughtre, and wast° also
Of catel° and of time; and forthermo,
It is repreve° and contrarie of honour
For to ben holde° a commune hasardour.°
And ever the hyer he is of estaat,
The more is he holden desolaat.°
If that a prince useth hasardrie,°
In alle governaunce and policie°
He is, as by commune opinoun,
Yholde° the lasse° in reputacioun.
Stilbon,° that was a wis embassadour,
Was sent to Corinthe, in ful greet honour,
Fro Lacidome,° to make hir alliaunce.
And whan he cam, him happede,° par° chaunce,
That all the grettest that were of that lond,
Pleyinge atte hasard° he hem fond.
For which, as sone as it mighte be,
He stal him° hoom again to his contree,
And seide, “Ther wol I nat lese my name;
N’I wol nat° take on me so greet defame,°
Yow for t’allie unto° none hasardours.
Sendeth othere wise embassadours;
For, by my trouthe, me were lever° die,
Than I yow shold to hasardours allie.
For ye that been so glorious in honours
Shul nat allien yow with hasardours
As by my wil, ne as by my tretee.”°
This wise philosophre thus seide he.

¶Loke eek that, to the king Demetrius
The king of Parthes, as the book seith us,
Sente him a paire of dees° of gold in scorn,
For he hadde used hasard therbiforn;°
For which he heeld° his glorie or his renoun
At no value or reputacioun.
Lordes may finden other maner pley°
Honeste° ynough to drive the day awey.°

¶Now wol I speke of othes false and grete
A word or two, as olde bokes trete.°
Gret swering is a thing abhominable,
And false swering is yet more reprevable.°
The heighe God forbad swering at al,°
Witnesse on° Mathew; but in special
Of swering seith the holy Jeremie,
“Thou shalt sey sooth thin othes, and nat lie,
And swere in dome,° and eek in rightwisnesse”;°
But idel° swering is a cursednesse.
Bihold and see, that in the firste table°
Of heighe Goddes hestes° honurable,
How that the seconde heste of him is this—
“Tak nat my name in idel° or amis.”
Lo, rather° he forbedeth° swich swering
Than homicide or many a cursed thing;°
I sey that, as by ordre, thus it stondeth;
This knoweth that° his hestes understondeth,
How that the second heste of God is that.
And forther over,° I wol thee telle al plat,
That vengeance shal nat parten from his hous,
That of his othes is to outrageous.°
“By Goddes precious herte, and by his nailes,
And by the blode of Crist, that is in Hailes,
Seven is my chaunce,° and thin is cink° and treye;°
By Goddes armes, if thou falsly pleye,
This dagger shal thurghout thin herte go”—
This fruit° cometh of the bicched bones° two,
Forswering,° ire, falsnesse, homicide.
Now, for the love of Crist that for us dide,°
Leveth° your othes, bothe grete and smale;

¶But, sirs, now wol I telle forth° my tale.
Thise riotoures° three, of whiche I telle,
Longe erst er° prime rong of° any belle,
Were set hem in a tavern for to drinke;
And as they satte, they herde a belle clinke°
Biforn° a cors,° was caried to his grave;
That oon of hem gan callen to his knave,°
“Go bet,”° quod he, “and axe redily,
What cors is this that passeth heer forby;°
And look that thou reporte his name wel.”°
“Sir,” quod this boy, “it nedeth neveradel.°
It was me told,° er ye cam heer, two houres;
He was, pardee,° an old felawe° of youres;
And sodeinly he was yslain tonight,°
Fordronke,° as he sat on his bench upright;
Ther cam a privee° theef, men clepeth° Deeth,
That in this contree al the peple sleeth,
And with his spere he smoot° his herte atwo,
And wente his wey withouten wordes mo.
He hath a thousand slain this pestilence:°
And, maister, er ye come in his presence,
Me thinketh that it were necessarie
For to be war of swich an adversarie:
Beth redy for to mete him evermore.°
Thus taughte me my dame,° I sey namore.”

¶“By Seinte Marie,” seid this taverner,°
“The child seith sooth,° for he hath slain this yeer,
Henne° over a mile, within a greet° village,
Both man and womman, child and hine,° and page.°
I trowe° his habitacioun° be there;
To been avised° greet wisdom it were,
Er that he dide a man a dishonour.”

¶“Ye, Goddes armes,” quod this riotour,
“Is it swich peril with him for to mete?
I shal him seke by wey° and eek by strete,
I make avow to Goddes digne° bones!
Herkneth, felawes, we three been al ones;°
Lat ech of us holde up his hond til other,°
And ech of us bicomen otheres brother,
And we wol sleen this false traitour Deeth;
He shal be slain, which that° so many sleeth,
By Goddes dignitee,° er it be night.”
Togidres° han thise three her trouthes° plight,°
To live and dyen ech of hem for other,
As though he were his owene yboren brother.
And up they sterte° al° dronken, in this rage,°
And forth they goon towardes that village,
Of which the taverner had spoke biforn,
And many a grisly ooth than han they sworn,
And Cristes blessed body they torente°—
Deeth shal be deed, if that° they may him hente.°

¶Whan they han goon nat fully° half a mile,
Right° as they wolde han troden° over a stile,
An old man and a povre° with hem mette.
This olde man ful mekely° hem grette,°
And seide thus, “Now, lordes, God yow see!”°
The proudest° of thise riotoures three
Answerde again, “What? Carl,° with sory grace,°
Why artow al forwrapped° save thy face?
Why livestow° so longe in so greet° age?”

¶This olde man gan loke in his visage,°
And seide thus, “For° I ne can nat finde
A man, though that I walked into Inde,°
Neither in citee nor in no village,
That wolde chaunge° his youthe for min age;
And therfore moot I han° min age stille,
As longe time as° it is Goddes wille.
Ne deeth, allas! ne wol nat° han my lif;
Thus walke I, lik a restelees caitif,°
And on the ground, which is my modres gate,
I knokke with my staf, bothe erly and late,
And seye, ‘Leve° moder,° leet me in!
Lo, how I vanish, flesh, and blood, and skin!
Allas! whan shul my bones been at reste?
Moder, with yow wolde I chaunge° my cheste,°
That in my chambre longe time hath be,
Ye! for an heire clout° to wrappe me!’
But yet to me she wol nat do that grace,°
For which ful pale and welked° is my face.

¶But, sirs, to yow it is no curteisie°
To speken to an old man vileinie,°
But° he trespasse° in worde, or elles in dede.
In holy writ° ye may yourself wel rede,
‘Agains° an old man, hoor° upon his heed,
Ye sholde arise’°; wherfor I yeve° yow reed,°
Ne dooth unto an old man noon harm now,
Namore than ye wold° men did to yow
In age, if that ye so longe abide;°
And God be with yow, wher° ye go° or ride.
I moot go thider° as I have to go.”

¶“Nay, olde cherl, by God, thou shalt nat so,”
Seide this other hasardour° anon;
“Thou partest° nat so lightly,° by Seint John!
Thou spak right now of thilke° traitour Deeth,
That in this contree alle our frendes sleeth.
Have heer my trouthe,° as thou art his aspie,°
Tel wher he is, or thou shalt it abie,°
By God, and by the holy sacrament!
For soothly thou art oon of his assent,°
To sleen us yonge folk, thou false theef!”°

¶“Now, sirs,” quod he, “if that yow be so leef°
To finde Deeth, turne up this croked wey,°
For in that grove I lafte him, by my fey,°
Under a tree, and ther he wol abide;°
Nat for your boost° he wol him no thing° hide.
See ye that ook?° right ther ye shul him finde.
God save yow, that boghte again° mankinde,
And° yow amend!”—Thus seid this olde man.

¶And everich° of thise riotoures ran,
Til he cam to that tree, and ther they founde
Of florins fine of golde ycoined° rounde
Wel ny° an eighte° busshels, as hem thoughte.°
No lenger thanne after Deeth they soughte,
But ech of hem so glad was of that sighte,
For that° the florins been so faire and brighte,
That doun they sette hem° by this precious hord.°

¶The worste of hem he spake the firste word.
“Brethren,” quod he, “tak kepe° what I seye;
My wit° is greet, though that I bourde° and pleye.
This tresor hath fortune unto us yiven,°
In mirthe and jolitee our lif to liven,
And lightly° as it comth,° so wol we spende.
Ey! Goddes precious dignitee! who wende°
Today, that we sholde han so fair a grace?°
But might this gold° be caried fro this place
Hoom to min hous, or elles unto youres—
For wel ye woot that al this gold is oures—
Than were we° in heigh felicitee.°
But trewely, by daye it may nat be;
Men wolde seyn that we were theves stronge,°
And for our owene tresor doon us honge.°
This tresor moste ycaried be by nighte
As wisly° and as slyly° as it mighte.
Wherfore I rede° that cut° among us alle
Be drawe, and lat se wher the cut wol falle;
And he that hath the cut with herte blithe°
Shal renne to the toune, and that ful swithe,°
And bringe us breed and win ful prively.°
And two of us shul kepen subtilly°
This tresor wel; and, if he wol nat tarie,
Whan it is night, we wol this tresor carie
By oon assent,° wheras° us thinketh° best.”

¶That oon of hem the cut broughte in his fest,°
And bad hem° drawe, and loke wher it wol falle;
And it fil° on the yongeste of hem alle;
And forth toward the toun he wente anon.
And also° sone as that° he was agon,
That oon of hem spak thus unto that other,
“Thou knowest wel thou art my sworne brother,
Thy profit° wol I telle thee° anon.
Thou woost° wel that our felawe is agon;
And heer is gold, and that ful greet plentee,
That shal departed° been among us three.
But natheles, if I can shape it° so
That it departed were among us two,
Hadde I nat doon a freendes torn° to thee?”

¶That other answerde, “I noot° how that may be;
He woot° how that the gold is with us tweye,°
What shal we doon, what shal we to him seye?”
“Shal it be conseil?”° seid the firste shrewe,°
“And I shal tellen thee, in wordes fewe,
What we shal doon, and bringe it wel aboute.”
“I graunte,” quod that other, “out of doute,°
That, by my trouthe,° I wol thee nat biwreie.”°

¶“Now,” quod the first, “thou woost wel we be tweie,
And two of us shul strenger be than oon.
Look whan that he is set,° and right anoon
Aris,° as though thou woldest with him pleye;
And I shal rive° him thurgh the sides tweye
Whil that thou strogelest° with him as in game,
And with thy dagger look thou do the same;
And than shal al this gold departed be,
My dere freend, bitwixen me and thee;
Than may we bothe our lustes° al fulfille,
And pleye at dees right at our owene wille.”
And thus acorded° been thise shrewes tweie
To sleen the thridde, as ye han herd me seye.

¶This yongest, which that wente unto the toun,
Ful ofte in herte° he rolleth up and doun°
The beautee of thise florins newe and brighte.
“O Lord!” quod he, “if so° were that I mighte
Have al this tresor to myself allone,
Ther is no man that liveth under the trone°
Of God, that sholde live so mery as I!”
And atte laste° the feend,° our enemy,
Putte in his thought that he shold poison beie,°
With which he mighte sleen his felawes tweie;
For why° the feend fond him° in swich livinge,°
That he had leve° him to sorwe bringe,
For this was outrely° his fulle entente
To sleen hem bothe, and never to repente.

¶And forth he gooth, no lenger wolde he tarie,
Into the toun, unto a pothecarie,°
And preyed° him, that° he him wolde selle
Som poison, that he mighte his rattes quelle;°
And eek ther was a polcat° in his hawe,°
That, as he seide, his capouns° hadde yslawe,°
And fain° he wolde wreke him,° if he mighte,
On vermin,° that destroyed him° by nighte.
The pothecarie answerde, “And thou shalt have
A thing that, also° God my soule save,
In al this world ther nis no° creature,
That ete or dronke hath of this confiture°
Noght but the mountance° of a corn° of whete,
That he ne shal his lif anon forlete;°
Ye,° sterve° he shal, and that in lasse while°
Than thou wolt goon a paas° nat but° a mile;
This poison is so strong and violent.”
This cursed man hath in his hond yhent°
This poison in a box, and sith° he ran
Into the nexte strete, unto a man,
And borwed of him large botels three;
And in the two his poison poured he;
The thridde° he kepte clene for his drinke.
For al the night he shoop him° for to swinke°
In caryinge of the gold out of that place.
And whan this riotour, with sory grace,°
Had filled with win his grete botels three,
To his felawes again repaireth° he.

¶What nedeth it to sermone° of it more?
For right as they had cast° his deeth bifore,
Right so they han him slain, and that anon.°
And whan that this was doon, thus spak that oon,
“Now lat us sitte and drinke, and make us merie,
And afterward we wol his body berie.”°
And with that word it happed him, par cas,°
To tak the botel ther° the poison was,
And drank, and yaf his felaw drinke also,
For which anon they storven° bothe two.
But, certes, I suppose that Avicen
Wroot never in no canon,° ne in no fen,°
Mo wonder° signes of empoisoning
Than had thise wrecches two, er hir ending.°

¶Thus ended been° thise homicides° two,
And eek the false empoisoner° also.
O cursed sinne, ful of cursednesse!
O traitours homicide, o wikkednesse!
O glotonie, luxurie,° and hasardrie!°
Thou blasphemour of Crist with vileinie°
And othes grete, of usage and of pride!
Allas! mankinde, how may it bitide,°
That to thy creatour which that thee wroghte,°
And with his precious herte-blood thee boghte,°
Thou art so fals and so unkinde,° allas!

¶Now, good men, God foryeve yow your trespas,°
And ware yow fro° the sinne of avarice.
Min holy pardoun may yow al warice,°
So that° ye offre nobles° or sterlinges,°
Or elles silver broches,° spones,° ringes.
Boweth your heed under this holy bulle!°
Cometh up, ye wives, offreth of° your wolle!
Your names I entre° heer in my rolle° anon;
Into the blisse of hevene shul ye gon;
I yow assoile,° by min heigh power,
Yow that wol offre, as clene° and eek as cleer°
As° ye were born; and, lo, sirs, thus I preche.
And Jesu Crist, that is our soules leche,°
So graunte yow his pardon to receive;
For that is best; I wol yow nat deceive.

¶But sirs, o° word forgat I in my tale,
I have relikes and pardon in my male,°
As faire as any man in Engelond,
Whiche were me yeven° by the Popes hond.
If any of yow wol, of devocioun,°
Offren, and han min absolucioun,
Cometh forth anon, and kneleth heer adoun,
And mekely receiveth my pardoun:
Or elles, taketh pardon as ye wende,°
Al newe and fresh, at every tounes ende,
So° that ye offren alwey newe and newe°
Nobles and pens, which that be gode and trewe.
It is an honour to everich° that is heer,
That ye mowe° have a suffisant pardoneer°
T’assoille° yow, in contree° as ye ride,
For aventures° which that may bitide.

¶Peraventure° ther may falle oon or two
Doun of° his hors, and breke his nekke atwo.°
Look which a seuretee° is it to yow alle
That I am in your felaweship yfalle,°
That may assoille° yow, both more and lasse,
Whan that the soul shal fro the body passe,
I rede° that our Host heer shal biginne,
For he is most envoluped° in sinne.
Com forth, sir Host, and offre first anon,
And thou shalt kiss the reliks everichon,
Ye,° for a grote!° unbokel anon thy purs.”

¶“Nay, nay,” quod he, “than have I° Cristes curs!
Lat be,” quod he, “it shal nat be, so thee’ch!°
Thou woldest make me kisse thin old breech,°
And swere it were a relik of a seint,
Thogh it were with thy fundement° depeint!°
But by the crois which that Seint Eleine° fond,
I wolde I had thy coillons° in min hond
In stede of relikes or of seintuarie;°
Lat cutte hem of,° I wol thee helpe hem carie;
Thay shul be shrined° in an hogges tord.”°

¶This Pardoner answerde nat a word;
So wrooth° he was, no word ne wolde he seye.
“Now,” quod our Host, “I wol no lenger pleye°
With thee, ne with noon other angry man.”

¶But right anon the worthy Knight bigan,
Whan that he° saugh that al the peple lough,°
“Namore of this, for it is right ynough;°
Sir Pardoner, be glad and mery of chere;
And ye, sir Host, that been to me so dere,
I prey yow that ye kiss the Pardoner.
And Pardoner, I prey thee, drawe° thee neer,
And, as we diden, lat us laughe and pleye.”
Anon they kiste, and riden forth hir weye.°
