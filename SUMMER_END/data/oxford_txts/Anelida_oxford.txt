Thou ferse° god of armes, Mars the rede,
That in the frosty contre called Trace,°
Within thy grisly temple ful of drede°
Honoured art, as patroun° of that place!
With thy Bellona, Pallas, ful of grace,
Be present, and my song continue and gie;°
At my beginning thus to thee I crie.
 
For it ful depe is sonken in my minde,
With pitous° herte in English for t’endite°
This olde storie, in Latin which I finde,
Of quene Anelida and fals Arcite,
That elde,° which that al can frete° and bite,°
As it hath freten mony a noble storie,
Hath nigh devoured out of our memorie.
 
Be favorable eek, thou Polymia,°
On Parnaso° that, with thy sustres glade,
By Elicon, not fer from Cirrea,
Singest with vois memorial° in the shade,
Under the laurer° which that may not fade,
And do that° I my ship to haven° winne;°
First folow I Stace, and after him Corinne.

Whan Theseus, with werres longe and grete,
The aspre° folk of Cithe° had overcome,
With laurer crouned, in his char gold-bete,°
Hoom to his contre-houses° is ycome,
For which the peple, blisful al and somme,
So criden, that unto the sterres it wente,
And him to honouren dide al hir entente;
 
Beforn this duk, in signe of victorie,
The trompes come, and in° his baner large
The image of Mars; and, in token of glorie,
Men mighten seen of tresor many a charge,°
Many a bright helm, and many a spere and targe,°
Many a fresshe knight, and blisful° route,°
On hors, on fote, in al the felde aboute.
 
Ipolita° his wif, the hardy° quene
Of Cithia, that he conquered hadde,
With Emelie, hir yonge suster shene,°
Faire in a char° of golde he with him ladde,
That al the ground aboute hir char she spradde
With brightnesse of the beautee in hir face,
Fulfild of largesse° and of alle grace.
 
With his triumphe and laurer-crouned thus,
In al the floure of fortunes yevinge,°
Lete I° this noble prince Theseus
Toward Athenes in his wey ridinge,
And founde I° wol in shortly for to bringe
The slye wey° of that° I gan to write,
Of quene Anelida and fals Arcite.
 
Mars, which through his furious course of ire,°
The olde wrath of Juno to fulfille,°
Hath set the peples hertes bothe on fire
Of Thebes and Grece, everich° other to kille
With blody speres, ne rested never stille,
But throng° now her, now ther, among hem bothe,
That everich other slough,° so wer they wrothe.°
 
For whan Amphiorax and Tideus,
Ipomedon, Parthonopee also
Were dede, and slaine proud Campaneus,
And whan the wrecched Thebans, bretheren° two,
Were slain, and king Adrastus hoom ago,
So desolat stood Thebes and so bare,
That no wight° coud no remedie of his care.°
 
And whan the olde Creon gan espie
How that the blood roial was broght adoun,
He held the cite by his tirannie,
And did° the gentils of that regioun
To been his frendes, and dwellen in the toun.
So what for love of him, and what for awe,°
The noble folk wer to the toune ydrawe.
 
Among al these, Anelida the quene
Of Ermony° was in that toun dwellinge,
That fairer was then is the sonne shene;°
Throughout the world so gan hir name springe,
That hir to seen had every wight likinge;
For, as of trouthe, is ther noon hir liche,
Of al the women in this worlde riche.
 
Yong was this quene, of twenty yeer of elde,
Of midel stature, and of swich fairnesse,
That Nature had a joye hir to behelde;
And for to speken of hir stedfastnesse,°
She passed both Penelope and Lucresse,
And shortly if she shal be comprehended,°
In hir ne mighte nothing been amended.
 
This Theban knight, eek for the sooth to seyne,
Was yong, and therwithal a lusty° knight,
But he was double° in love and nothing pleine,°
And subtil in that crafte over any wight,
And with his cunning wan this lady bright;
For so ferforth° he gan hir trouthe° assure,
That she him trusted over any creature.
 
What shuld I seyn? she loved Arcite so,
That, whan that he was absent any throwe,°
Anon hir thoghte hir herte brast° atwo;
For in hir sight to hir he bar him lowe,°
So that she wende° have al his herte yknowe;
But he was fals; it nas but feined chere,°
As nedeth not to men such craft to lere.
 
But nevertheles ful mikel° besinesse
Had he, er that he mighte his lady winne,
And swoor he wolde dyen for distresse,
Or from his wit he seide he wolde twinne.°
Alas, the while! for it was routhe° and sinne,
That she upon his sorowes wolde rewe,°
But nothing° thenketh the fals as doth the trewe.
 
Hir fredom fond° Arcite in swich manere,
That al was his that she hath, moche and lite,
Ne to no creature made she chere
Ferther than it liked° to Arcite;
Ther was no lak° with which he mighte hir wite,°
She was so ferforth yeven° him to plese,
That al that liked him, did hir herte ese.
 
Ther nas to hir no maner lettre ysent
That touched love, from any maner wight,
That she ne shewed it him, er it was brent;°
So plein° she was, and did hir fulle might,
That she nil hiden° nothing from hir knight,
Lest he of any untrouthe° hir upbreide;°
Withouten bode° his heste° she obeide.
 
And eek he made him jelous over here,°
That, what that any man had to hir seid,
Anoon he wolde preyen hir to swere
What was that word, or make him evel apaid;°
Than wende° she out of hir wit have braid;°
But al this nas but sleight° and flaterie,
Withouten love he feined jelosie.
And al this took she so debonerely,°
That al his wille, hir thoghte it skilful° thing,
And ever the lenger she loved him tenderly,
And did him honour as he were a king.
Hir herte was wedded to him with a ring;
So ferforth upon trouthe is hir entente,
That wher he goth, hir herte with him wente.
 
Whan she shal° ete, on him is so hir thoght,
That wel unnethe° of mete° took she keep;°
And whan that she was to hir reste broght,
On him she thoghte alwey til that she sleep;
Whan he was absent, prevely she weep;
Thus liveth fair Anelida the quene
For fals Arcite, that did hir al this tene.°
 
This fals Arcite, of his newfangelnesse,°
For she to him so lowly was and trewe,
Took lesse deintee° of hir stedfastnesse,
And saw another lady, proud and newe,
And right anon he clad° him in hir hewe°
Wot I not whether in white, rede, or grene,
And falsed fair Anelida the quene.
 
But nevertheles, gret wonder was it noon
Thogh he wer fals, for it is kinde° of man,
Sith Lamek was, that is so longe agoon,
To been in love as fals as ever he can;
He was the firste fader that began
To loven two, and live in bigamie;
And he found tentes first, but if men lie.
 
This fals Arcite sumwhat moste he feine,
Whan he wex fals, to covere his traitorie,
Right as an hors, that can both bite and pleine;°
For he bar hir on honde° of trecherie,
And swoor he coude hir doublenesse espie,
And al was falsnes that she to him mente;
Thus swoor this theef,° and forth his way he wente.
 
Alas! what herte might enduren it,
For routhe or wo, hir sorow for to telle?
Or what man hath the cunning or the wit?
Or what man might within the chambre dwelle,
If I to him rehersen shal the helle,
That suffreth fair Anelida the quene
For fals Arcite, that did hir al this tene?°
 
She wepeth, waileth, swowneth° pitously,
To grounde deed she falleth as a stoon;
Al crampisshed° hir limes crokedly,
She speketh as hir wit were al agoon;
Other colour then° asshen hath she noon,
Noon other word [she speketh] moche or lite,
But “Mercy, cruel herte min, Arcite!”
 
And thus endureth, til that she was so mate°
That she nad° foot on which she may sustene;°
But for languisshing ever in this estate,°
Of which Arcite hath nouther routhe ne tene;°
His hert was elleswhere, newe and grene,
That on hir wo ne deineth him not to thinke,
Him rekketh° never wher she flete° or sinke.
 
His newe lady holdeth him so narowe°
Up by the bridel,° at the staves ende,
That every word, he drad° hit as an arowe;
Hir daunger° made him bothe bowe and bende,
And as hir liste,° made him turne or wende;°
For she ne graunted him in hir livinge
No grace why° that he hath lust to singe;°
 
But drof° him forth, unnethe liste hir knowe°
That he was servaunt to hir ladyshippe,
But lest that he wer proude, she held him lowe;
Thus serveth he, withouten fee or shipe,°
She sent him now to londe, now to shippe;
And for she yaf him daunger° al his fille,
Therfor she had him at hir owne wille.
 
Ensample of this, ye thrifty° wimmen alle,
Taketh of Anelida and fals Arcite,
That for hir liste him her dere herte calle,°
And was so meek, therfor he loved hir lite;°
The kinde of mannes herte is to delite
In thing that straunge is, also God me save!
For what he may not gete, that wolde he have.
 
Now turn we to Anelida agein,
That pineth° day by day in languisshing;
But whan she saw that hir ne gat no gein,°
Upon a day, ful sorowfully weping,
She caste hir° for to make a compleining,°
And with hir owne honde she gan it write;
And sente it to hir Theban knight Arcite.

So thirleth° with the point of remembraunce,
The swerd of sorowe, ywhet° with fals plesaunce,
    Min herte, bare of blis and blak of hewe,
That turned is in quaking° al my daunce,°
My suretee° in awhaped countenaunce;°
    Sith it availeth not for to ben trewe;
    For whoso trewest° is, it shal hir rewe,°
That serveth love and doth hir observaunce
    Alwey to oon, and chaungeth for no newe.
 

 
I wot° myself as wel as any wight;°
For I loved oon with al my herte and might
    More then myself, an hundred thousand sithe,°
And called him my hertes lif, my knight,
And was al his, as fer as it was right;
    And whan that he was glad, than was I blithe,°
    And his disese° was my deeth as swithe;°
And he ayein his trouth me had yplight°
    For evermore, his lady me to kithe.°
 
 
 
Now is he fals, alas! and causeles,
And of my wo he is so routheles,°
    That with a worde him list not° ones deine°
To bring ayein my sorowful herte in pees,
For he is caught up in another lees.°
    Right as him list, he laugheth at my peine,
    And I ne can min herte not restreine,
That I ne love him alwey, nevertheles;
    And of al this I not to whom me pleine.°
 
 
 
And shal I pleine, alas! the harde stounde°
Unto my foo that yaf my herte a wounde,
    And yet desireth that min harm be more?
Nay, certes! for there never shall be founde
Non other help, my sores for to sounde.°
    My desteny hath shapen it ful yore;°
    I wil non other medecine ne lore;°
I wil ben ay ther I was ones bounde,
    That° I have seid, be seid for evermore!
 
 
Alas! wher is become your gentilesse!
Your wordes ful of plesaunce and humblesse?
    Your observaunces in so low manere,
And your awaiting° and your besinesse°
Upon me, that ye calden your maistresse,
    Your soverein lady in this worlde here?
    Alas! and is ther nother word ne chere°
Ye vouchesauf upon min hevinesse?
    Alas! your love, I bye it al to dere.
 

    Now certes, swete, thogh that ye
    Thus causeles the cause be
    Of my dedly adversitee,
Your manly reson oghte it to respite°
    To slee° your frend, and namely me,
    That never yet in no degree
    Offended yow, as wisly he
That al wot,° out of wo my soule quite!°
    But for I shewed yow, Arcite,
    Al that men wolde° to me write,
    And was so besy, yow to delite,
My honour safe, meke, kinde, and free,
    Therfor ye putte on me the wite,°
    And of me recche° not a mite,
    Thogh that the swerd of sorow bite°
My woful herte through your crueltee.
 

 
My swete foo, why do ye so, for shame?
And thenke ye that furthered be your name,
    To love a newe, and been untrewe? nay!
And putte yow in sclaunder now and blame,
And do° to me adversitee and grame,°
    That love yow most, God, wel thou wost!° alway.
    Yet come ayein, and be al plein° som day,
And turne al this that hath be mis to game,
    And al foryive, whil that I live may.
 

 
Lo! herte min,° al this is for to seyne,
As whether shal I preye° or elles pleine?°
    Whiche is the wey to doon° yow to be trewe?
For either mot° I have yow in my cheine,°
Or with the deth ye mot departe us tweine;
    Ther ben non other mene° weyes newe;
    For God so wisly on my soule rewe,
As verily ye sleen me with the peine;
    That may ye see unfeined of min hewe.
 

 
For thus ferforth have I my dethe soght,
Myself I mordre with my prevy° thoght;
    For sorow and routhe° of your unkindenesse
I wepe, I wake, I faste; al helpeth noght;
I weive° joy that is to speke of oght,
    I voide companie, I flee gladnesse;
    Who may avaunte° hir bet° of hevinesse
Then I? and to this plite° have ye me broght,
    Withoute gilt; me nedeth no witnesse.
 

 
And shall I preye,° and weive° womanhede?
Nay! rather deth then do so foul a dede,
    And axe° mercy gilteles! what nede?
And if I pleine° what life that I lede,
Yow rekketh° noght; that knowe I, oute of drede;°
    And if I unto yow min othes° bede°
    For min excuse, a scorn shal be my mede;°
Your chere floureth,° but it wol not sede;°
    Ful longe agoon I oght have take hede.
 
   
For thogh I hadde yow tomorow agein,
I might as wel holde° Averill° fro rein,
    As holde yow, to make yow be stedfast.
Almighty God, of trouthe soverein,
Wher is the trouthe° of man? who hath it slein?
    Who that hem loveth she shal hem finde as fast°
    As in a tempest is a roten mast.
Is that a tame° best that is ay fein°
    To renne away, when he is leest agast?°

 
Now mercy, swete, if I misseye,°
    Have I seid oght amis, I preye?
    I not;° my wit is al aweye.
I fare as doth the song of Chauntepleure.
    For now I pleine, and now I pleye,
    I am so mased° that I deie,
    Arcite hath born awey the keye
Of al my worlde, and my good aventure!
    For in this worlde nis creature
    Wakinge, in more discomfiture
    Then I, ne more sorowe endure;
And if I slepe a furlong wey° or tweie,
    Than thinketh me, that your figure
    Before me stant,° clad° in asure,°
    To swere yet eft a newe assure°
For to be trewe, and mercy me to preye.°
 

 
The longe night this wonder° sight I drie,°
And on the day for this afray° I die,
    And of al this right noght, ywis, ye recche.
Ne never mo min eyen two be drie,
And to your routhe and to your trouthe I crie.
    But welawey! to fer be they to fecche;
    Thus holdeth me° my destinee a wrecche.°
But me to rede° out of this drede or gie°
    Ne may my wit, so weik is it, not strecche.
 
Than ende I thus, sith I may do no more,
I yeve it up for now and evermore;
    For I shal never eft put in balaunce°
My sekernes,° ne lerne of love the lore.°
But as the swan, I have herd seid ful yore,
    Ayeins° his deth shal singe in his penaunce,°
    So singe I here my destiny or chaunce,
How that Arcite Anelida so sore
    Hath thirled° with the point of remembraunce!
 
Whan that Anelida this woful quene
Hath of hir hande writen in this wise,
With face deed, betwixe pale and grene,°
She fel aswowe;° and sith° she gan to rise,
And unto Mars avoweth° sacrifise
Within the temple, with a sorowful chere,
That shapen° was as ye shal after here.
