¶Whan Phebus° dwelled here in this erthe adoun,
As olde bokes maken mencioun,
He was the moste lusty bachiler°
In al this world, and eek the beste archer;
He slow Phitoun,° the serpent, as he lay
Slepinge again° the sonne upon a day;
And many another noble worthy dede
He with his bowe wroghte, as men may rede.

¶Pleyen he coude on every minstralcie,
And singen, that it was a melodie,
To heren of his clere vois the soun.°
Certes the king of Thebes, Amphioun,
That with his singing walled that citee,
Coud never singen half so wel as he.
Therto he was the semelieste° man
That is or was, sith that° the world bigan.
What nedeth it° his fetures to discrive?
For in this world was noon so fair on live.°
He was therwith fulfild of gentillesse,
Of honour, and of parfit° worthinesse.°

¶This Phebus, that was flour of bachelrie,°
As wel in fredom° as in chivalrie,°
For his desport,° in signe eek° of victorie
Of Phitoun, so as telleth us the storie,
Was wont° to beren in his hand a bowe.

¶Now had this Phebus in his hous a crowe,
Which in a cage he fostred° many a day,
And taughte it speken, as men teche a jay.°
Whit was this crowe, as is a snow-whit swan,
And countrefete° the speche of every man
He coude, whan he sholde telle a tale.
Therwith in al this world no nightingale
Ne coude, by an hondred thousand deel°
Singen so wonder° merily and weel.

¶Now had this Phebus in his hous a wif,
Which that he lovede more than his lif,
And night and day dide ever his diligence
Hir for to plese, and doon hir reverence,°
Save only, if the soth° that I shal sayn,
Jalous he was, and wolde have kept hir° fain;°
For him were looth° bijaped for to be.°
And so is every wight° in swich degree;°
But al in idel for it availleth noght.°
A good wif, that is clene of werk° and thoght,
Shold nat been kept in noon await,° certain;
And trewely, the labour is in vain
To kepe a shrewe,° for it wol nat be.
This holde I° for a verray nicetee,°
To spille° labour, for to kepe° wives;
Thus writen olde clerkes in hir lives.

¶But now to purpos, as I first bigan:
This worthy Phebus dooth all that he can
To plesen hir, wening° by swich plesaunce,
And for° his manhede° and his governaunce,°
That no man sholde han put him° from hir grace.°
But God it woot,° ther may no man embrace°
As to destreine° a thing, which that nature
Hath naturelly set in a creature.

¶Tak any brid, and put it in a cage,
And do al thin entente° and thy corage
To fostre° it tendrely with mete° and drinke,
Of alle deintees° that thou canst bithinke,°
And keep it also clenly° as thou may;
Although his cage of gold be never so gay,°
Yet hath this brid, by twenty thousand fold,°
Lever° in a forest, that is rude° and cold,
Gon ete° wormes and swich wrecchednesse.°
For ever this brid wol doon his bisinesse°
To escape out of his cage, if he may;
His libertee this brid desireth ay.°

¶Lat take° a cat, and fostre° him wel with milk,
And tendre flesh,° and make his couche° of silk,
And lat him seen a mous go by the wal;
Anon he weiveth° milk, and flesh, and al,
And every deintee° that is in that hous,
Swich appetit he hath to ete a mous.
Lo, here hath lust° his dominacioun,
And appetit flemeth° discrecioun.

¶A she-wolf hath also a vileins kinde;°
The lewedeste° wolf that she may finde,
Or leest of reputacion wol she take,
In time whan hir lust to han a make.°

¶Al thise ensamples speke I by thise men
That been untrewe,° but no thing by wommen.
For men han° ever a likerous° appetit
On lower thing to parfourne° hir delit°
Than on hir wives, be they never so faire,
Ne never so trewe,° ne so debonaire.°
Flesh is so newefangel° with meschaunce,°
That we ne conne° in no thing han plesaunce
That souneth° into vertu any while.

¶This Phebus, which that thoghte upon no gile,°
Deceived was, for al his jolitee;°
For under him another hadde she,
A man of litel reputacioun,
Noght worth to Phebus in comparisoun.
The more harm is; it happeth° ofte so,
Of which ther cometh° muchel harm and wo.

¶And so bifel whan Phebus was absent,
His wif anon hath for hir lemman° sent,
Hir lemman? certes,° this is a knavish° speche!
Foryeveth° it me, and that I yow biseche.

¶The wise Plato seith, as ye may rede,
The word mot nede° accorde with the dede.°
If men shal telle proprely° a thing,
The word mot° cosin° be to the werking.°
I am a boistous° man, right thus seye I,
Ther nis no° difference, trewely,
Bitwixe° a wif that is of heigh degree,°
If of hir body dishonest she be,
And a povre wenche,° other than this—
If it so be, they werke° bothe amis—
But that° the gentile,° in hire estaat above,
She shal be cleped° his lady, as in love;
And for that other is a povre womman,
She shal be cleped° his wenche,° or his lemman.°
And, God it woot,° min owene dere brother,
Men leyn that oon as lowe as lith that other.°

¶Right so,° bitwixe a titlelees tiraunt°
And an outlawe,° or a theef erraunt,°
The same I sey, ther is no difference.
To Alisaundre told was this sentence;°
That, for° the tirant is of gretter might,
By force of meinee° for to sleen° doun right,
And brennen° hous and hoom, and make al plain,°
Lo! therfor is he cleped° a capitain;°
And, for the outlawe hath but smal meinee,°
And may nat doon so greet an harm as he,
Ne bringe a contree° to so greet mescheef,°
Men clepen° him an outlawe or a theef.°
But, for I am a man noght textuel°
I wol noght telle° of textes never a del;°
I wol go° to my tale, as I bigan.

¶Whan Phebus wif had sent for hir lemman,°
Anon they wroghten al hir lust volage.°
The white crowe, that heng ay° in the cage,
Biheld° hir werk, and seide never a word.
And whan that hoom was come Phebus, the lord,
This crowe sang “Cokkow!° Cokkow! Cokkow!”

¶“What, brid?”° quod Phebus, “What song singestow?°
Ne were thow wont° so merily to singe
That to min herte it was a rejoisinge°
To here thy vois? allas! what song is this?”
“By God,” quod he, “I singe nat amis;
Phebus,” quod he, “for al thy worthinesse,°
For al thy beautee and thy gentilesse,°
For al thy song and al thy minstralcie,°
For al thy waiting,° blered° is thin eye
With oon of litel reputacioun,
Noght worth to thee, as in comparisoun,
The mountance° of a gnat;° so mote I thrive!°
For on thy bed thy wif I saugh him swive.”°

¶What wol ye more? the crowe anon him tolde,
By sadde° tokenes° and by wordes bolde,°
How that his wif had doon° hir lecherie,
Him to gret shame and to gret vileinie;°
And tolde him° ofte, he saugh it with his eyen.

¶This Phebus gan aweiward for to wryen,°
Him thoughte his sorweful herte brast° atwo;
His bowe he bente, and set therinne a flo,°
And in his ire° his wif thanne hath he slain.°
This is th’effect,° ther is namore to sayn;
For sorwe of which he brak his minstralcie,°
Bothe harpe, and lute, and giterne, and sautrie;°
And eek he brak his arwes and his bowe.
And after that, thus spak he to the crowe:

¶“Traitour,” quod he, “with tonge of scorpioun,
Thou hast me broght to my confusioun!°
Allas! that I was wroght!° why nere° I deed?
O dere wif, o gemme of lustiheed,°
That were to me so sad° and eek so trewe,°
Now listow° deed, with face pale of hewe,
Ful giltelees, that dorste° I swere, ywis!°
O rakel° hand, to doon so foule amis!
O trouble wit,° O ire recchelees,°
That unavised° smitest giltelees!°
O wantrust,° ful of fals suspecioun,
Where was thy wit and thy discrecioun?°
O every man, bewar of rakelnesse,°
Ne trow° nothing withouten strong witnesse;
Smit° nat to sone,° er that ye witen° why,
And beeth avised° wel and sobrely
Er° ye doon any execucioun,°
Upon° your ire, for° suspecioun.
Allas! a thousand folk hath rakel ire°
Fully fordoon,° and broght hem in the mire.°
Allas! for sorwe I wol myselven slee!”°

¶And to the crowe, “O false theef!” seide he,
“I wol thee quite° anon thy false tale!
Thou songe whilom° lik a nightingale;
Now shaltow, false theef, thy song forgon,°
And eek thy white fetheres everichon,
Ne never in al thy lif ne shaltou speke.
Thus shal men on a traitour been awreke;°
Thou and thin ofspring ever shul be blake,
Ne never swete noise shul ye make,
But ever crie again° tempest and rain,
In tokening° that thurgh thee my wif is slain.”

¶And to the crowe he stirte,° and that anon,°
And pulled° his white fetheres everichon,°
And made him blak, and refte° him al his song,
And eek° his speche, and out at dore him slong°
Unto the devel which° I him bitake;°
And for this caas° ben° alle crowes blake.—

¶Lordings, by this ensample I yow preye,
Beth war, and taketh kepe° what I seye:
Ne telleth never no man in your lif
How that° another man hath dight° his wif;
He wol yow haten mortally, certein.
Daun° Salomon, as wise clerkes seyn,
Techeth a man to kepe his tonge wel;
But as I seide, I am noght textuel.
But nathelees, thus taughte me my dame:
“My son, thenk on the crowe, a Goddes name;
My son, keep wel thy tonge and keep thy freend.
A wikked tonge is worse than a feend.°
My sone, from a feend men may hem blesse;°
My son, God of his endelees goodnesse
Walled a tong with teeth and lippes eke,
For man sholde him avise° what he speke.
My son, ful ofte, for° to muche speche,
Hath many a man ben spilt,° as clerkes teche;
But for a litel speche avisely°
Is no men shent,° to speke generally.
My son, thy tonge sholdestow° restreine
At alle time, but° whan thou doost thy peine°
To speke of God, in honour and preyere.
The firste vertu, sone, if thou wolt lere,°
Is to restreine and kepe wel thy tonge.—
Thus lerne children whan that they ben yonge.—
My sone, of muchel speking ivel avised,°
Ther° lasse° speking hadde ynough suffised,
Comth muchel harm, thus was me told and taught.
In muchel speche sinne wanteth naught.°
Wostow° wherof a rakel° tonge serveth?°
Right as a swerd forcutteth and forkerveth°
An arm atwo, my dere sone, right so
A tonge cutteth frendship al atwo.
A jangler° is to God abhominable;
Reed Salomon, so wis and honurable;
Reed David in his psalmes, reed Senekke.°
My son, spek nat, but with thin heed thou bekke.°
Dissimule° as thou were deef, if that thou here
A jangler speke of perilous° matere.
The Fleming seith, and lerne it, if thee leste,°
That litel jangling causeth muchel reste.
My sone, if thou no wikked word hast seid,
Thee thar nat° drede for to be biwreid;°
But he that hath misseid,° I dar wel sayn,
He may by no wey clepe° his word again.
Thing that is seid, is seid; and forth it gooth,
Though° him repente, or be him leef or looth.°
He is his thral° to whom that he hath said°
A tale, of which he is now ivel apaid.°
My son, be war, and be non auctour newe°
Of tidinges,° whether they ben false or trewe.
Wherso° thou come, amonges hie° or lowe,
Kepe wel thy tonge, and thenk upon the crowe.
