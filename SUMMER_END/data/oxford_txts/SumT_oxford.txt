¶Lordings, ther is in Yorkshire, as I gesse,°
A mersshy° contree called Holdernesse,
In which ther wente a limitour° aboute,
To preche, and eek to begge, it is no doute.°
And so bifel,° that on a day° this frere
Had preched at a chirche in his manere,
And specially, aboven every thing,
Excited° he the peple in his preching,
To trentals,° and to yeve, for Goddes sake,
Wherwith° men mighten holy houses° make,
Ther° as divine service is honoured,
Nat ther as it is° wasted and devoured,
Ne ther it nedeth nat° for to be yive,°
As to possessioners,° that mowen° live,
Thanked be God, in wele° and habundaunce.
“Trentals,” seide he, “deliveren fro penaunce°
Hir freendes soules, as wel olde as yonge,
Ye, whan that they been hastily° ysonge;
Nat for to holde° a preest joly° and gay,°
He singeth nat but o masse in a day;
Delivereth out,”° quod he, “anon° the soules;
Ful hard it is with fleshhook° or with oules°
To been yclawed, or to brenne° or bake;
Now speed yow hastily, for Cristes sake.”
And whan this frere had seid al his entente,
With qui cum patre° forth his wey he wente.

¶Whan folk in chirche had yeve him what hem leste,°
He wente his wey, no lenger wolde he reste,
With scrippe° and tipped staf, ytukked° hie;
In every hous he gan to poure° and prie,°
And beggeth mele,° and chese, or elles corn.°
His felawe hadde a staf tipped with horn,
A peire of tables° al of ivory,
And a pointel° polisshed fetisly,°
And wroot the names alwey, as he stood,
Of alle folk that yaf him any good,
Ascaunces° that he wolde for hem preye.
“Yif us a busshel whete, malt, or reye,°
A Goddes kechil,° or a trip° of chese,
Or elles what yow list,° we may nat chese;
A Gods halfpeny° or a masse-peny,°
Or yif us of your brawn,° if ye have eny;
A dagon° of your blanket,° leve° dame,
Our suster dere, lo! here I write your name;
Bacon or beef, or swich thing as ye finde.”

¶A sturdy harlot° wente ay hem bihinde,
That was hir hostes man, and bar° a sak,
And what° men yaf° hem, leide it on his bak.
And whan that he° was out at dore anon,
He planed awey° the names everichon°
That he biforn had writen in his tables;
He served hem with nifles° and with fables.

¶“Nay, ther thou lixt,° thou somnour,” quod the Frere.

¶“Pees,” quod our Host, “for Cristes moder dere;
Tel forth thy tale and spare° it nat at al.”

¶“So thrive° I,” quod this somnour, “so I shal.”—

¶So longe he wente hous by hous, til he
Cam til an hous ther° he was wont° to be
Refresshed° mor than in an hundred placis.
Sik lay the goode man,° whos the place is;
Bedrede° upon a couche lowe he lay.
“Deus hic,”° quod he, “O Thomas, freend, good day,”
Seid this frere curteisly and softe.°
“Thomas,” quod he, “God yelde° yow, ful ofte
Have I upon this bench faren ful weel.°
Here have I eten many a murie meel”;
And fro the bench he droof° awey the cat,
And leide adoun his potente° and his hat,
And eek his scrippe,° and sette him softe adoun.
His felaw was go walked° into toun,
Forth with his knave,° into that hostelrie°
Wheras° he shoope him° thilke° night to lie.°

¶“O dere maister,” quod this sike man,
“How han ye fare° sith° that March bigan?
I saugh yow noght this fourtenight° or more.”
“God woot,” quod he, “laboured have I ful sore;°
And specially, for thy savacioun
Have I seid many a precious orisoun,°
And for oure other frendes, God hem blesse!
I have today been at your chirche at messe,°
And seid a sermon after° my simple wit,°
Nat al° after the text of holy writ;
For it is hard to° yow, as I suppose,
And therfor wol I teche yow al the glose.°
Glosinge is a glorious thing, certein,
For lettre sleeth,° so as we clerkes seyn.
Ther° have I taught hem to be charitable,
And spende hir good° ther° it is resonable,
And ther I saugh our dame;° a! where is she?”

¶“Yond in the yerd° I trowe° that she be,”
Seid this man, “and she wol come anon.”°

¶“Ey, maister! welcom be ye, by Seint John!”
Seid this wif, “How fare ye hertely?”°

¶The frere ariseth up ful curteisly,
And hir embraceth in his armes narwe,°
And kiste hir swete, and chirketh° as a sparwe
With his lippes: “Dame” quod he, “right weel,
As he that is your servant every deel.°
Thanked be God, that yow yaf° soule and lif,
Yet saugh I nat this day so fair° a wif
In al the chirche, God so save me!”

¶“Ye, God amend defautes,° sir,” quod she,
“Algates° welcom be ye, by my fey!”

¶“Graunt mercy,° dame, this have I founde alwey.°
But of your grete goodness, by your leve,
I wolde prey yow that ye nat yow greve,°
I wol with Thomas speke° a litel throwe.°
Thise curatz° been ful necligent and slowe
To grope° tendrely a conscience.
In shrift,° in preching is my diligence,
And studie in Petres wordes, and in Poules.
I walke, and fisshe° Cristen mennes soules,
To yelden° Jhesu Crist his propre rente;
To sprede his word is set al min entente.”

¶“Now, by your leve, o dere sir,” quod she,
“Chideth° him weel, for Seinte Trinitee.°
He is as angry as a pissemire,°
Though that he have al that he can desire.
Though I him wrie° anight and make him warm,
And on him ley my leg outher° min arm,
He groneth lik our boor,° lith° in our sty.
Other desport° right noon of him have I;
I may nat plese him in no maner cas.”°

¶“O Thomas! Je vous dy,° Thomas! Thomas!
This maketh° the feend, this moste ben amended.°
Ire is a thing that hye God defended,°
And therof wol I speke a word or two.”

¶“Now maister,” quod the wif, “er that I go,
What wol ye dine?° I wol go theraboute.”°

¶“Now dame,” quod he, now “Je vous dy sanz doute,°
Have I nat° of a capon° but° the livere,
And of your softe breed nat but° a shivere,°
And after that a rosted pigges heed,
(But° that I nold no° beest for me were deed),
Thanne hadde I with yow hoomly° suffisaunce.°
I am a man of litel sustenaunce.°
My spirit hath his fostring° in the Bible.
The body is ay so redy and penible°
To wake, that my stomak° is destroyed.
I prey yow, dame, ye be nat anoyed,
Though I so freendly° yow my conseil° shewe;°
By God, I nold nat telle it but° a fewe.”

¶“Now, sir,” quod she, “but o° word er° I go;
My child is deed withinne° thise wikes two,
Soone after that ye wente out of this toun.”

¶“His deeth saugh I by revelacioun,”
Seith this frere, “at hoom in our dortour.°
I dar wel seyn that, er that half an hour
After his deeth, I saugh him born to blisse°
In min avisioun,° so God me wisse!°
So dide our sextein° and our fermerer,°
That han been trewe freres fifty yeer;
They may now, God be thanked of his lone,°
Maken hir jubilee and walke allone.
And up I roos, and al our covent° eke,
With many a tere trikling on my cheke,
Withouten noise or clateringe of belles;
Te deum° was our song and nothing elles,
Save that to Crist I seide an orisoun,°
Thankinge him of° his revelacioun.
For sire and dame, trusteth me right weel,
Oure orisons been more effectueel,°
And moor we seen of Cristes secree° thinges
Than burel° folk, although° they weren kinges.
We live in poverte and in abstinence,
And burel folk in richesse and despence°
Of mete and drinke, and in hir foul delit.°
We han° this worldes lust° al in despit.°
Lazar and Dives liveden diversly,°
And divers guerdon° hadden they therby.
Whoso wol preye, he moot° faste and be clene,°
And fatte° his soule and make his body lene.
We fare° as seith th’apostle; cloth° and fode°
Suffisen° us, though they be nat ful gode.
The clennesse° and the fastinge of us freres
Maketh° that Crist accepteth our preyeres.

¶“Lo, Moises fourty days and fourty night
Fasted, er that the heighe God of might
Spak with him in the mountaine of Sinay.
With empty wombe,° fasting many a day,
Received he the law that was writen
With Gods finger; and Elie,° wel ye witen,°
In mount Oreb,° er he hadde any speche
With hye God, that is our lives leche,°
He fasted longe and was in contemplaunce.°

¶“Aaron, that had the temple in governaunce,°
And eek the other preestes everichon,°
Into the temple whan they sholde gon
To preye for the peple, and do servise,
They nolden° drinken, in no maner wise,°
No drinke, which that mighte hem dronke make,
But there in abstinence preye and wake,
Lest that they deiden;° tak heed what I seye.
But° they be sobre that° for the peple preye,
War° that° I sey,—namore! for it suffiseth.

¶“Our Lord Jhesu, as holy writ deviseth,°
Yaf° us ensample of fastinge and preyeres.
Therfor we mendinants,° we sely° freres,
Been wedded to poverte and continence,°
To charitee, humblesse,° and abstinence,
To persecucion° for rightwisnesse,°
To weping, misericorde,° and clennesse.°
And therfor may ye see that our preyeres—
I speke of us, we mendinantz, we freres—
Ben to the hye God more acceptable
Than youres, with your festes° at the table.
Fro Paradis first, if I shal nat lie,
Was man out chaced° for his glotonie;
And chaast° was man in Paradis, certein.

¶“But herkne° now, Thomas, what I shal seyn.
I ne have no text of it, as I suppose,
But I shall finde it in a maner° glose,°
That specially our sweete Lord Jesus
Spak this by° freres, whan he seide thus:
‘Blessed be they that povre° in spirit been.’
And so forth al the gospel may ye seen,
Wher° it be liker° our professioun,°
Or hirs° that swimmen° in possessioun.°
Fy on hir° pompe° and on hir glotonie!
And for hir° lewednesse° I hem diffie.°

¶“Me thinketh° they ben lik Jovinian,
Fat as° a whale, and walkinge as a swan;
Al vinolent° as botel° in the spence.°
Hir preyere is of ful greet reverence;
Whan they for soules sey the psalm of Davit,
Lo, ‘buf!’° they sey, ‘cor meum eructavit!’°
Who folweth Cristes gospel and his fore,°
But we that humble been and chast and pore,
Werkers of Goddes word, not auditours?°
Therfor, right as an hauk up, at a sours,°
Up springeth into th’eir, right so° prayeres
Of charitable and chaste bisy freres
Maken hir sours° to Goddes eres° two.
Thomas! Thomas! so mote I ride or go,°
And by that lord that clepid° is Seint Yve,
Nere° thou our brother, sholdestou° nat thrive!°
In our chapitre° pray we day and night
To Crist, that he thee sende hele° and might,°
Thy body for to welden° hastily.”

¶“God woot,” quod he, “nothing therof fele I;°
As help me Crist, as I, in fewe° yeres,
Have spended, upon divers maner freres,
Ful many a pound; yet fare° I never the bet.°
Certein, my good° have I almost biset.°
Farwel, my gold! for it is al ago!”°

¶The frere answerde, “O Thomas, dostow so?°
What nedeth yow° diverse° freres seche?°
What nedeth him that hath a parfit leche°
To sechen other leches in the toun?
Your inconstance° is your confusioun.°
Hold ye° than me, or elles our covent,
To pray for yow ben insufficient?
Thomas, that jape° nis nat worth a mite;°
Your maladie is for° we han to lite.
‘A! yif° that covent half a quarter otes!’°
‘A! yif that covent four and twenty grotes!’°
‘A! yif that frere a peny, and lat him go!’
Nay, nay, Thomas! it may nothing° be so.
What is a ferthing° worth parted in twelve?
Lo, ech thing that is oned° in himselve
Is more strong than whan it is toscatered.°
Thomas, of° me thou shalt nat been yflatered;
Thou woldest han our labour al for noght.
The hye God, that al this world hath wroght,
Seith that the werkman worthy is his hire.°
Thomas! noght° of your tresor I desire
As for myself, but that al our covent
To prey for yow is ay° so diligent,
And for to builden Cristes owne chirche.
Thomas! if ye wol lernen for to wirche,°
Of buildinge up of chirches may ye finde
If° it be good, in Thomas lif of Inde.
Ye lie heer, ful of anger and of ire,
With which the devel set° your herte afire,
And chiden heer this sely° innocent,
Your wif, that is so meke and pacient.
And therfor, Thomas, trow° me if thee leste,°
Ne strive° nat with thy wif, as for thy beste;°
And ber this word awey now, by thy feith,
Touching° this thing, lo, what the wise° seith:
‘Within thin hous ne be thou no leoun;
To thy subgitz° do noon oppressioun;
Ne make thine aqueintance nat to flee.’
And Thomas, yet eftsones° I charge thee,
Be war from° hir that in thy bosom slepeth;
War fro the serpent that so slyly crepeth
Under the gras, and stingeth subtilly.
Be war, my sone, and herkne° paciently,
That twenty thousand men han lost hir lives,
For striving with hir lemmans° and hir wives.
Now sith ye han so holy and meke a wif,
What nedeth yow,° Thomas, to maken strif?
Ther nis,° ywis, no serpent so cruel,
Whan man tret° on his tail, ne half so fel,°
As womman is, whan she hath caught an ire;°
Vengeance is thanne al that they desire.
Ire is a sinne, oon of the grete of sevene,
Abhominable unto the God of hevene;
And to himself it is destruccion.
This every lewed° viker° or person°
Can sey, how ire engendreth° homicide.
Ire is, in sooth, executour° of pride.
I coude of ire sey so muche sorwe,
My tale sholde laste til tomorwe.
And therfor preye I God both day and night,
An irous° man, God sende him litel might!°
It is greet harm and, certes, gret pitee,
To sette an irous man in heigh degree.

¶“Whilom° ther was an irous potestat,°
As seith Senek,° that, duringe his estaat,°
Upon a day° out riden knightes two,
And as fortune wold that it were so,
That oon of hem cam hoom, that other noght.
Anon the knight bifor the juge is broght,
That seide thus, ‘Thou hast thy felaw slain,
For which I deem° thee to the deeth, certain.’
And to another knight comanded he,
‘Go lede him to the deeth, I charge thee.’
And happed,° as they wente by the weye°
Toward the place ther° he sholde deye,
The knight cam, which men wenden° had be deed.
Than thoughte they, it was the beste reed,°
To lede hem bothe to the juge again.
They seiden, ‘Lord, the knight ne hath nat slain
His felaw; here he standeth hool alive.’
‘Ye shul be deed,’ quod he, ‘so moot I thrive!°
That is to seyn, bothe oon, and two, and three!’
And to the firste knight right thus spak he,
‘I dampned° thee, thou most algate° be deed.
And thou also most nedes° lese° thin heed,
For thou art cause why thy felawe deith.’
And to the thridde knight right thus he seith,
‘Thou hast nat doon that° I comanded thee.’
And thus he did don sleen hem° alle three.

¶“Irous Cambises was eek dronkelewe,°
And ay delited him to been a shrewe.°
And so bifel, a lord of his meinee,°
That loved vertuous moralitee,
Seide on a day° bitwix hem two right thus:

¶“ ‘A lord is lost, if he be vicious;°
And dronkenesse is eek a foul record°
Of any man, and namly° in a lord.
Ther is ful many an eye and many an ere
Awaiting on° a lord, and he noot° where.
For Goddes love, drink more attemprely;°
Win maketh man to lesen° wrecchedly
His minde, and eek his limes° everichon.’

¶“ ‘The revers shaltou° se,’ quod he, ‘anon;
And preve it, by thin owne experience,
That win ne dooth to folk no swich offence.°
Ther is no win bireveth me° my might
Of hond ne foot, ne of mine eyen sight’—
And, for despit,° he drank ful muchel more
An hondred part° than he had doon bifore;
And right anon, this irous cursed wrecche
Bifore him leet this knightes sone fecche,°
Comandinge him he shold bifore him stonde.
And sodeinly he took his bowe in honde,
And up the streng he pulled to his ere,
And with an arwe° he slow° the child right there:
‘Now wheither have I° a siker hand or noon?’
Quod he, ‘Is al my might and minde agoon?
Hath win bireved me° min eyen sight?’

¶“What sholde I telle th’answere of the knight?
His son was slain, ther is namore to seye.
Beth war° therfor with lordes how ye pleye.
Singeth ‘Placebo,’° and ‘I shal, if I can,’
But if° it be unto a poure man.
To a poure man men sholde hise vices telle,
But nat to a lord, thogh he shold go to helle.

¶“Lo irous° Cirus, thilke° Percien,
How he destroyed the river of Gysen,°
For that° an hors of his was drent° therinne,
Whan that he wente Babiloign° to winne.°
He made that the river was so smal,
That wommen mighte wade it over al.
Lo, what seide he, that so wel teche° can?
‘Ne be no felaw to an irous man,
Ne with no wood° man walke by the weye,
Lest thee repent’; ther is namore to seye.

¶“Now Thomas, leve brother, lef° thin ire;°
Thou shalt me finde as just° as is a squire.°
Hold nat the devels knif ay at thin herte;
Thin angre dooth thee° al to sore smerte;°
But shew° to me al thy confessioun.”

¶“Nay,” quod the sike man, “by Seint Simoun!
I have be shriven° this day at my curat;°
I have him told al hoolly° min estat;°
Nedeth namoor to speke of it,” seith he,
“But if° me list° of° min humilitee.”

¶“Yif me thanne of thy gold, to make our cloistre,”°
Quod he, “for many a muscle° and many an oistre,
Whan other men han ben ful wel at eise,
Hath been our fode, our cloistre for to reise.°
And yet, God woot, unnethe° the fundement°

Nis nat a tile yet withinne our wones;°
By God, we owen° fourty pound for stones!
Now help, Thomas, for him that harwed° helle!
For elles moste we our bookes selle.
And if ye lakke our predicacioun,°
Than gooth the world al to destruccioun.
For whoso wolde us fro this world bireve,°
So God me save, Thomas, by your leve,
He wold bireve out of this world the sonne.
For who can teche and werchen° as we conne?°
And that is nat of litel time,”° quod he;
“But sith° that Elie° was, or Elisee,°
Han freres been, that finde I of record,°
In charitee, ythanked be our lord.
Now Thomas, help, for Seinte Charitee!”°
And doun anon he sette him° on his knee.

¶This sike man wex° wel ny° wood° for ire;
He wolde° that the frere had been on fire
With his false dissimulacioun.°
“Swich thing as is in my possessioun,”
Quod he, “that may I yeven, and non other
Ye sey me thus, how that I am your brother?”

¶“Ye, certes,” quod the frere, “trusteth weel;
I took° our dame° our lettre with our seel.”°

¶“Now wel,” quod he, “and somwhat° shal I yive°
Unto your holy covent whil I live,
And in thin hand thou shalt it have anoon,°
On this condicioun, and other noon,°
That thou departe° it so, my deere brother,
That every frere have also° muche as other.
This shaltou swere on thy professioun,°
Withouten fraude or cavillacioun.”°

¶“I swere it,” quod this frere, “upon my feith!”
And therwithal° his hand in his he leith:°
“Lo, heer my feith! in me shal be no lak.”

¶“Now thanne, put thin hand doun by my bak,”
Seid this man, “and grope wel bihinde;
Bineth my buttok there° shaltow finde
A thing that I have hid in privetee.”°

¶“A!” thoght this frere, “This shal go with° me!”
And doun his hand he launcheth° to the clifte,°
In hope for to finde there a yifte.
And whan this sike man felt this frere
Aboute his tuwel° grope there and here,
Amidde° his hand he leet the frere a fart.
Ther nis no capul,° drawinge in a cart,
That mighte have lete° a fart of swich a soun.

¶The frere up stirte° as doth a wood° leoun:
“A! false cherl,” quod he, “for Goddes bones,
This hastow for despit° doon, for the nones!
Thou shalt abie° this fart, if that I may!”

¶His meinee,° which that herden this affray,°
Cam lepinge° in, and chaced out the frere;
And forth he gooth, with a ful angry chere,°
And fette° his felaw,° theras° lay his stoor.°
He looked as it° were a wilde boor;
He grinte with° his teeth, so was he wrooth.
A sturdy pas° doun to the court° he gooth,
Wheras° ther woned° a man of greet honour,
To whom that he was alwey confessour;°
This worthy man was lord of that village.
This frere cam, as he were in a rage,
Whereas this lord sat eting at his bord.°
Unnethes° mighte the frere speke a word,
Til atte laste he seide: “God yow see!”°

¶This lord gan looke,° and seide, “Benedicite!
What, frere John, what maner° world is this?
I see wel that som thing ther is amis.
Ye loken as° the wode° wer ful of thevis,°
Sit doun anon, and tel me what your greef° is,
And it shal been amended,° if I may.”

¶“I have,” quod he, “had a despit° this day,
God yelde yow!° adoun in your village,
That in this world is noon so poure° a page,°
That he nolde° have abhominacioun°
Of that° I have received in your toun.
And yet ne greveth° me nothing so sore,°
As that this olde cherl, with lokkes hore,°
Blasphemed hath our holy covent eke.”

¶“Now, maister,” quod this lord, “I yow biseke.”°
“No maister, sir,” quod he, “but servitour,°
Thogh I have had in scole° swich honour.
God liketh nat that ‘Raby’° men us calle,
Neither in market n’in° your large halle.”
“No fors,”° quod he, “but tel me al your grief.”

¶“Sir,” quod this frere, “an odious meschief°
This day bitid is° to min ordre and me,
And so per consequens° to ech degree
Of holy chirche, God amende it sone!”

¶“Sir,” quod the lord, “ye woot what is to done.°
Distempre yow noght,° ye be my confessour;
Ye been the salt of th’erthe and the savour.°
For Goddes love your pacience ye holde;
Tel me your grief”: and he anon him tolde,
As ye han herd biforn, ye woot wel what.

¶The lady of the hous ay stille° sat,
Til she had herd al what° the frere saide:
“Ey, Goddes moder,” quod she, “blisful maide!
Is ther oght° elles? Tel me faithfully.”

¶“Madame,” quod he, “how thinketh yow herby?”°
“How that me thinketh?” quod she; “So God me speede,°
I seye, a cherl° hath doon a cherles dede.
What shold I seye? God lat him never thee!°
His sike heed is ful of vanitee,
I hold him in a maner frenesie.”°

¶“Madame,” quod he, “by God I shal nat lie;
But° I on° other wise may be wreke,°
I shal diffame° him overal° ther° I speke,
This false blasphemour, that charged me
To parte° that wol° nat departed be,
To every man iliche,° with meschaunce!”°

¶The lord sat stille as° he were in a traunce,
And in his herte he rolled up and doun,
“How had this cherl imaginacioun°
To shewe swich a problem to the frere?
Nevere erst er° now herde I of swich matere;
I trow° the devel putte it in his minde.
In arsmetrike° shal ther no man finde,
Biforn this day, of swich a questioun.°
Who sholde make a demonstracioun,°
That every man sholde have iliche° his part
As of the soun or savour° of a fart?
O nice° proude cherl, I shrewe° his face!
Lo, sires,” quod the lord, “with harde grace,°
“Who ever herde of swich a thing er now?
To every man ilike? tel me how?
It is an inpossible,° it may nat be!
Ey, nice cherl, God lete° him never thee!°
The rumblinge of a fart, and every soun,
Nis but of eir° reverberacioun,
And evere it wasteth° lite and lite° awey.
Ther is no man can demen,° by my fey,
If that it wer departed equally.
What, lo, my cherl, lo, yet how shrewedly°
Unto my confessour today he spak!
I holde him certein a demoniak!°
Now eet your mete,° and lat the cherl go pleye,°
Lat him go honge° himself a devel weye!”

¶Now stood the lordes squier at the bord,°
That° carf° his mete, and herde, word by word,
Of alle thing of which I have yow said.

¶“My lord,” quod he, “be ye nat yvel apaid;°
I coude telle, for a goune-clooth,°
To yow, sir frere, so ye be nat wrooth,
How that this fart sholde even° deled° be
Among your covent, if it liked° me.”

¶“Tel,” quod the lord, “and thou shalt have anon
A gownecloth, by God and by Seint John!”

¶“My lord,” quod he, “whan that the weder is fair,
Withouten wind or perturbinge° of air,
Lat bringe° a cartwheel here into this halle,
But looke° that it have his° spokes alle.
Twelf spokes hath a cartwheel comunly.°
And bring me than twelf freres, woot ye° why?
For thrittene is a covent,° as I gesse.
The confessour heer, for° his worthinesse,
Shal parfourne up° the nombre of his covent.
Than shal they knele doun, by oon assent,°
And to every spokes ende, in this manere,
Ful sadly° leye his nose shal a frere.
Your noble confessour, ther God him save,°
Shal holde his nose upright, under the nave.°
Than shal this cherl, with bely stif and toght°
As any tabour,° hider been ybroght;
And sette him on the wheel right° of this cart,
Upon the nave, and make him lete a fart.
And ye shul seen, up° peril of my lif,
By preve° which that is demonstratif,°
That equally the soun of it wol wende,
And eek the stink, unto the spokes ende;
Save that° this worthy man, your confessour,
Bicause he is a man of greet honour,
Shal have the firste fruit,° as reson is;°
The noble usage° of freres yet is this,
The worthy men of hem shul first be served;
And certeinly, he hath it weel deserved.
He hath today taught us so muchel good
With preching in the pulpit ther° he stood,
That I may vouchesauf,° I sey for me,
He had° the firste smel of fartes three,
And so wolde al his covent hardily;
He bereth him° so faire and holily.”

¶The lord, the lady, ech man, save° the frere,
Seid that Jankin spak, in this matere,
As wel as Euclide or Protholomee.°

¶Touching° this cherl, they seide, subtiltee°
And heigh wit° made him speken as he spak;
He nis° no fool, ne no demoniak.
And Jankin hath ywonne a newe goune.—
My tale is doon; we been almost at toune.
