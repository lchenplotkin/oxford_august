¶Whilom° ther was dwellinge in my contree°
An erchdeken,° a man of heigh degree,
That boldely dide execucioun°
In punisshinge of fornicacioun,
Of wicchecraft, and eek of bauderie,°
Of diffamacioun,° and avoutrie,°
Of chirche-reves,° and of testamentz,°
Of contracts, and of lakke° of sacraments,
Of usure,° and of simonie° also.
But certes, lechours dide he grettest wo;
They sholde singen,° if that they were hent;°
And smale titheres° weren foule yshent.°
If any person wolde upon hem pleine,°
Ther mighte asterte him° no pecunial° peine.
For smale tithes and for smal offringe,
He maad the peple pitously to singe.°
For er° the bisshop caughte hem with his hook,
They weren in the erchedeknes book.
And hadde he, thurgh his jurisdiccioun,
Power to doon on° hem correccioun.
He hadde a somnour redy to his hond,
A slyer boy° was noon in Engelond;
For subtilly he hadde his espiaille,°
That taughte° him wher that him mighte availle.°
He coude spare of lechours oon or two,
To techen him° to foure and twenty mo.
For thogh this somnour° wood° were as an hare,
To telle his harlotrie° I wol nat spare;
For we been out of his correccioun;
They han of us no jurisdiccioun,
Ne never shullen, terme of° alle hir lives.

¶“Peter! so been the wommen of the stives,”°
Quod the Somnour, “yput out of my cure!”

¶“Pees, with mischance° and with misaventure,”°
Thus seide our Host, “and lat him telle his tale.
Now telleth forth, thogh that the Somnour gale,°
Ne spareth nat,° min owne maister dere.”

¶“This false theef,° this somnour,” quod the Frere,
“Hadde alwey baudes° redy to his hond,
As any hauk° to lure in Engelond,
That tolde him al the secree that they knewe;
For hir acqueintance was nat come of newe.°
They weren hise approwours° prively;
He took himself a greet profit therby;
His maister knew nat alwey what he wan.
Withouten mandement,° a lewed° man
He coude somne,° on peine° of Cristes curs,°
And they were gladde for to fille his purs,
And make him grete festes atte nale.°
And right as Judas hadde purses smale,
And was a theef, right swich a theef was he;
His maister hadde but half his duetee.°
He was, if I shal yeven him his laude,°
A theef, and eek a somnour, and a baude.
He hadde eek wenches° at his retenue,°
That, wheither that sir Robert or sir Huwe,
Or Jakke, or Rauf, or who-so that it were,
That lay by hem, they° tolde it in his ere;
Thus was the wenche and he of oon assent.°
And he wold fecche a feined mandement,°
And somne hem to the chapitre° bothe two,
And pile° the man, and let the wenche go.

¶“Than wolde he sey, ‘Frend, I shal for thy sake
Do striken hir out of our lettres blake;
Thee thar° namore as in this cas travaille;°
I am thy freend, ther I thee may availle.’°
Certein he knew of briberyes° mo°
Than possible is to telle in yeres two.
For in this world nis dogge for the bowe,°
That can an hurt deer from an hool° yknowe,
Bet than this somnour knew a sly lechour,
Or an avouter,° or a paramour.°
And, for that was the fruit° of al his rente,°
Therfore on it he sette al his entente.°

¶“And so bifel, that ones on a day
This somnour, ever waiting on° his pray,°
Rood for to somne° a widwe, an old ribibe,°
Feininge a cause, for° he wolde bribe.°
And happed° that he saugh bifore him ride
A gay° yeman,° under a forest side.
A bowe he bar, and arwes brighte and kene;°
He hadde upon a courtepy° of grene;
An hat upon his heed with frenges° blake.

¶“ ‘Sir,’ quod this somnour, ‘hail! and wel atake!’°
‘Welcom,’ quod he, ‘and every good felawe!
Wher ridestow under this grene shawe?’°
Seid this yeman, ‘Wiltow° fer° to day?’

¶“This somnour him answerde, and seide, ‘Nay;
Heer faste° by,’ quod he, ‘is min entente
To riden, for to reisen up° a rente
That longeth° to my lordes duëtee.°

¶“ ‘Artow thanne a bailly?’° ‘Ye!’ quod he.
He dorste nat, for verray filthe° and shame,
Sey that he was a somnour, for° the name.°

¶“ ‘Depardieux,’° quod this yeman, ‘deere brother,
Thou art a bailly, and I am another.
I am unknowen as in this contree;
Of thin aqueintance I wol praye thee,
And eek of brotherhede, if that yow leste.°
I have gold and silver in my cheste;
If that thee hap° to comen in our shire,°
Al shal be thin, right as thou wolt desire.’
‘Grantmercy,’ quod this somnour, ‘by my feith!’
Everich° in others hand his trouthe leith,°
For to be sworne bretheren til they deye.
In daliance° they riden forth hir weye.

¶“This somnour, which that was as ful of jangles,°
As ful of venim been thise wariangles,°
And ever enquering upon every thing,
‘Brother,’ quod he, ‘where is now your dwelling,
Another day if that I shold yow seche?’°
This yeman him answerde in softe speche,
‘Brother,’ quod he, ‘fer in the north contree,
Where, as I hope,° somtime I shal thee see.
Er we departe, I shal thee so wel wisse,°
That of min hous ne shaltow never misse.’

¶“ ‘Now, brother,’ quod this somnour, ‘I yow preye,
Teche me, whil that we riden by the weye,
Sin that ye been a baillif as am I,
Som subtiltee,° and tel me feithfully
In min office how I may most winne;
And spareth nat for° conscience ne sinne,
But as my brother tel me, how do ye?’

¶“ ‘Now, by my trouthe, brother deer,’ seid he,
‘As I shal tellen thee a feithful tale,
My wages been ful streite° and ful smale.
My lord is hard to me and daungerous,°
And mine office is ful laborous;
And therfor by extorcions I live.
For sothe, I take al that men wol me yive;
Algate, by sleighte° or by violence,
Fro yeer to yeer I winne al my dispence.°
I can no bettre tellen feithfully.’

¶“ ‘Now, certes,’ quod this somnour, ‘so fare I;
I spare nat to taken, God it woot,°
But if it be to hevy or to hoot.°
What I may gete in conseil° prively,
No maner conscience of that have I;
Nere° min extorcioun, I might° nat liven,
Ne of swich japes° wol I nat be shriven.°
Stomak° ne conscience ne knowe I noon;
I shrew° thise shrifte-fadres° everichoon.
Wel be we met, by God and by Seint Jame!
But, leve brother, tel me than thy name,’
Quod this somnour; and in this menewhile,
This yeman gan a litel for to smile.

¶“ ‘Brother,’ quod he, ‘wiltow that I thee telle?
I am a feend, my dwelling is in helle.
And heere I ride about° my purchasing,
To wite° wher° men wolde yeve me any thing.
My purchas° is th’effect° of al my rente.°
Looke how thou ridest for the same entente,
To winne good, thou rekkest° never how;
Right so fare I, for ride wolde I now
Unto the worldes ende for a preye.’°

¶“ ‘A,’ quod this somnour, ‘benedicite, what sey ye?
I wend° ye were a yeman trewely.
Ye han a mannes shap as wel as I;
Han ye a figure than determinat°
In helle, ther ye been in your estat?’

¶“ ‘Nay, certeinly,’ quod he, ‘ther have we noon;
But whan us liketh,° we can take us oon,
Or elles make yow seme° we ben shape
Somtime lik a man, or lik an ape;
Or lik an angel can I ride or go.°
It is no wonder thing thogh it be so;
A lousy joglour° can deceive thee,
And pardee, yet can° I mor craft than he.’

¶“ ‘Why,’ quod this somnour, ‘ride ye thanne or goon
In sondry shap,° and nat alwey in oon?’
‘For° we,’ quod he, ‘wol us swich formes make
As most able is our preyes° for to take.’

¶“ ‘What maketh° yow to han al this labour?’
‘Ful many a cause, leve sir somnour,’
Seid this feend, ‘but alle thing hath time.
The day is short, and it is passed prime,°
And yet ne wan I nothing in this day.
I wol entend to winnen,° if I may,
And nat entende our wittes to declare.°
For, brother min, thy wit is al to bare
To understonde, althogh I tolde hem thee.
But, for thou axest why labouren we;
For, somtime, we ben Goddes instrumentz,
And meenes° to don his comandementz,
Whan that him list, upon his creatures,
In divers art° and in divers figures.°
Withouten him we have no might, certain,
If that him list to stonden theragain.°
And somtime, at our prayere,° han we leve°
Only the body and nat the soule greve;°
Witnesse on° Job, whom that we diden wo.
And somtime han we might of bothe two,
This is to seyn, of soule and body eke.
And somtime be we suffred° for to seke
Upon° a man, and doon° his soule unreste,
And nat his body, and al is for the beste.
Whan he withstandeth our temptacioun,
It is a cause of his savacioun;
Albeit that it was nat oure entente
He shold be sauf,° but that we wolde him hente.°
And somtime be we servant unto man,
As to the erchebisshop Seint Dunstan,
And to the apostles servant eek was I.’

¶“ ‘Yet tel me,’ quod the Somnour, ‘feithfully,
Mak ye yow newe bodies thus alway
Of° elements?’ the feend answerde, ‘Nay;
Somtime we feine,° and somtimë we arise
With dede bodies in ful sondry wise,°
And speke as renably° and faire and wel
As to the Phitonissa did Samuel.
And yet wol som men sey it was nat he;
I do no fors° of your divinitee.°
But o thing warne I thee, I wol nat jape,
Thou wolt algates° wit° how we ben shape;
Thou shalt herafterward, my brother dere,
Com ther thee nedeth nat of me to lere.°
For thou shalt by thin owne experience
Conne in a chayer° rede° of this sentence°
Bet than Virgile, whil he was on live,
Or Dant also; now lat us ride blive.°
For I wol holde compaignie with thee
Til it be so, that thou forsake me.’

¶“ ‘Nay,’ quod this somnour, ‘that shal nat bitide;°
I am a yeman, knowen is ful wide;
My trouthe° wol I holde as in this cas.
For though thou were the devel Sathanas,
My trouthe wol I holde to my brother,
As I am sworn, and ech of us til other
For to be trewe brother in this cas;
And both we goon abouten our purchas.
Tak thou thy part, what that men wol thee yive,
And I shal min; thus may we bothe live.
And if that any of us have mor than other,
Lat him be trewe, and parte it with his brother.’

¶“ ‘I graunte,’ quod the devel, ‘by my fey.’°
And with that word they riden forth hir wey.
And right at the entring of the tounes ende,
To which this somnour shoop him for to wende,°
They saugh a cart, that charged° was with hey,
Which that a carter droof forth in his wey.°
Deep was the wey,° for which° the carte stood.°
This carter smoot,° and cride, as he were wood,°
‘Hait, Brok! hait,° Scot! what° spare° ye for the stones?
The feend,’° quod he, ‘yow fecche body and bones,
As ferforthly° as ever were ye foled!°
So muche wo as I have with yow tholed!°
The devel have al, both hors and cart and hey!’

¶“This somnour seid, ‘Heer shal we have a pley;’°
And neer the feend he drough,° as noght ne were,°
Ful prively,° and rouned° in his ere:
‘Herkne,° my brother, herkne, by thy feith;
Heerstow nat how° that the carter seith?
Hent° it anon, for he hath yeve° it thee,
Both hey and cart, and eek his caples° three.’

¶“ ‘Nay,’ quod the devel, ‘God wot,° never a deel;°
It is nat his entent, trust thou me weel.
Ax him thyself, if thou nat trowest° me,
Or elles stint a while,° and thou shalt see.’

¶“This carter thakketh° his hors upon the croupe,°
And they bigonne drawen° and to stoupe;°
‘Heyt, now!’ quod he, ‘Ther Jesu Crist yow blesse,
And al his handwerk, bothe more and lesse!
That was wel twight,° min owne lyard° boy!
I pray God save thee and Seinte Loy!
Now is my cart out of the slow,° pardee!’

¶“ ‘Lo! brother,’ quod the feend, ‘what tolde I thee?
Heer may ye see, min owne deere brother,
The carl° spak oon thing, but he thoghte another.
Lat us go forth abouten our viage;°
Heer winne I nothing upon cariage.’°

¶“Whan that they comen somwhat out of toune,
This somnour to his brother gan to roune,°
‘Brother,’ quod he, ‘heer woneth an old rebekke,°
That hadde almost as lief° to lese° hir nekke
As for to yeve a peny of hir good.
I wol han twelf pens, though that she be wood,°
Or I wol sompne hir unto oure office;°
And yet, God woot, of hir knowe I no vice.
But for thou canst nat, as in this contree,
Win thy cost,° tak heer ensample of me.’

¶“This Somnour clappeth° at the widwes gate.
‘Com out,’ quod he, ‘thou olde viritrate!
I trow° thou hast som frere or preest with thee!’

¶‘Who clappeth?’ seid this widwe, ‘Benedicite!
God save you, sir, what is your swete wille?’

¶“ ‘I have,’ quod he, ‘of somonaunce° a bille;°
Up peine of cursing,° looke that thou be
Tomorn biforn° the erchedeknes knee
T’answer to the court of certein thinges.’

¶“ ‘Now, lord,’ quod she, ‘Crist Jesu, king of kinges,
So wisly° helpe me, as I ne may.°
I have been sik, and that ful many a day.
I may nat go° so fer,’ quod she, ‘ne ride,
But I be deed,° so priketh° it in my side.
May I nat axe a libel,° sir somnour,
And answer there, by my procutour,°
To swich° thing as men wol opposen me?’°

¶“ ‘Yis,’ quod this somnour, ‘pay anon, lat se,
Twelf pens to me, and I wol thee acquite.
I shall no profit han therby but lite;
My maister hath the profit, and nat I.
Com of,° and lat me riden hastily;
Yif me twelf pens, I may no lenger tarie.’

¶“ ‘Twelf pens,’ quod she, ‘now lady Seinte Marie
So wisly° help me out of care and sinne,
This wide world thogh° that I sholde winne,
Ne have I nat twelf pens withinne min hold.°
Ye knowen wel that I am poure and old;
Kith° youre almesse° on me povre wrecche.’

¶“ ‘Nay than,’ quod he, ‘the foule feend me fecche
If I th’excuse, though thou shul be spilt!’°
‘Alas,’ quod she, ‘God woot, I have no gilt.’

¶“ ‘Pay me,’ quod he, ‘or by the sweet Seinte Anne,
As I wol bere awey thy newe panne°
For dette, which thou owest me of old,
Whan that thou madest thin housbond cokewold,°
I paide at hoom° for thy correccioun.’°

¶“ ‘Thou lixt,’° quod she, ‘by my savacioun!
Ne was I nevere er now, widwe ne wif,
Somoned unto your court in al my lif;
Ne nevere I nas° but of my body trewe!°
Unto the devel blak and rough of hewe°
Yeve I thy body and my panne also!’

¶“And whan the devel herde hir cursen so
Upon hir knees, he seide in this manere,
‘Now Mabely, min owne moder dere,
Is this your wil in ernest, that ye seye?’

¶“ ‘The devel,’ quod she, ‘so fecche° him er he deye,
And panne and al, but° he wol him repente!’°

¶“ ‘Nay, olde stot,° that is nat min entente,’
Quod this somnour, ‘for to repente me,
For° any thing that I have had of thee;
I wolde I hadde thy smok and every clooth!’

¶“ ‘Now, brother,’ quod the devel, ‘be nat wrooth;
Thy body and this pan ben mine by right.
Thou shalt with me to helle yet tonight,
Wher thou shalt knowen of our privetee°
More than a maister of divinitee’:°
And with that word this foule feend him hente;
Body and soule, he with the devel wente
Wheras that somnours han hir heritage.°
And God, that maked after his image
Mankinde, save and gide us alle and some;
And leve° thise somnours goode men bicome!

¶“Lordings, I coude han told yow,” quod this Frere,
“Hadde I had leiser for° this somnour here,
After the text of Crist and Poul and John
And of oure other doctours° many oon,
Swich peines, that your hertes mighte agrise,°
Albeit so, no tonge may devise,
Thogh that I mighte a thousand winter telle,°
The pein of thilke cursed hous of helle.
But, for to kepe° us fro that cursed place,
Waketh, and preyeth Jesu for his grace
So kepe us fro the temptour Sathanas.
Herketh this word, beth war as in this cas;
The leoun sit in his await alway
To slee the innocent, if that he may.
Disposeth ay your hertes to withstonde
The feend, that yow wold make thral and bonde.°
He may nat° tempte yow over° your might;°
For Crist wol be your champion and knight.
And prayeth that thise somnours hem repente
Of hir misdedes, er that the feend hem hente.”
