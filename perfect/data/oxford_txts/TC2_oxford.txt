Out of these blake wawes for to saile,
O wind, O wind, the weder ginneth clere;
For in this see the boot hath swich travaile,
Of my conning that unnethe I it stere:
This see clepe I the tempestous matere
Of desespeir that Troilus was inne:
But now of hope the calendes biginne.
O lady min, that called art Cleo,
Thou be my speed fro this forth, and my Muse,
To rime wel this book, til I have do;
Me nedeth here noon other art to use.
Forwhy to every lovere I me excuse,
That of no sentement I this endite,
But out of Latin in my tonge it write.
Wherfore I nil have neither thank ne blame
Of al this werk, but pray yow mekely,
Disblameth me, if any word be lame,
For as min auctor seide, so seye I.
Eek though I speke of love unfelingly,
No wonder is, for it no thing of newe is;
A blind man can nat juggen wel in hewis.
Ye knowe eek, that in forme of speche is chaunge
Withinne a thousand yeer, and wordes tho
That hadden pris, now wonder niceand straunge
Us thinketh hem; and yet they spake hem so,
And spedde as wel in love as men now do;
Eek for to winne love in sondry ages,
In sondry londes, sondry ben usages.
And forthi if it happe in any wise,
That here be any lovere in this place
That herkeneth, as the story wol devise,
How Troilus com to his lady grace,
And thenketh, so nolde I nat love purchace,
Or wondreth on his speche and his doinge,
I noot; but it is me no wonderinge;
For every wight which that to Rome went,
Halt nat o path, or alwey o manere.
Eek in some lond were al the gamen shent,
If that they ferde in love as men don here,
As thus, in open doing or in chere,
In visitinge, in forme, or seide hir sawes;
Forthi men seyn, ech contree hath his lawes.
Eek scarsly been ther in this place three
That have in love seid lik and doon in al;
For to thy purpos this may liken thee,
And thee right nought, yet al is seid or shal;
Eek som men grave in tree, som in stoon wal,
As it bitit; but sin I have begonne,
Min auctor shal I folwen, if I conne.
In May, that moder is of monthes glade,
That fresshe floures, blewe, and white, and rede,
Ben quike again, that winter dede made,
And ful of bawme is fletinge every mede;
Whan Phebus doth his brighte bemes sprede
Right in the white Bole, it so bitidde
As I shal singe, on Mayes day the thridde,
That Pandarus, for al his wise speche,
Felte eek his part of loves shottes kene,
That, coude he never so wel of loving preche,
It made his hewe aday ful ofte grene;
So shoop it, that him fil that day a tene
In love, for which in wo to bedde he wente,
And made, er it was day, ful many a wente.
The swalwe Proignè, with a sorwful lay,
Whan morwe com, gan make hir weimentinge,
Why she forshapen was; and ever lay
Pandare abedde, half in a slomberinge,
Til she so neigh him made hir chiteringe
How Tereus gan forth hir suster take,
That with the noise of hir he gan awake;
And gan to calle, and dresse him up to rise,
Remembringe him his erand was to done
From Troilus, and eek his greet emprise;
And caste and knew in good plit was the mone
To doon viage, and took his wey ful sone
Unto his neces paleis ther biside.
Now Janus, god of entree, thou him gide!
Whan he was come unto his neces place,
“Wher is my lady?” to hir folk quod he;
And they him tolde; and he forth in gan pace,
And fond two othere ladies sete and she
Withinne a paved parlour; and they three
Herden a maiden reden hem the geste
Of the Sege of Thebes, whil hem leste.
Quod Pandarus, “Ma dame, God yow see,
With al your book and al the companie!”
“Ey, uncle min, welcome ywis,” quod she,
And up she roos, and by the hond in hie
She took him faste, and seide, “This night thrie,
To goode mote it turne, of yow I mette!”
And with that word she doun on bench him sette.
“Ye, nece, ye shal fare wel the bet,
If God wole, al this yeer,” quod Pandarus;
“But I am sory that I have yow let
To herknen of your book ye preisen thus;
For Goddes love, what seith it? tel it us.
Is it of love? O, som good ye me lere!”
“Uncle,” quod she, “your maistresse is not here!”
With that they gonnen laughe, and tho she seide,
“This romaunce is of Thebes, that we rede;
And we han herd how that king Laius deide
Thurgh Edippus his sone, and al that dede;
And here we stenten at these lettres rede,
How the bisshop, as the book can telle,
Amphiorax, fil thurgh the ground to helle.”
Quod Pandarus, “Al this knowe I myselve,
And al th’assege of Thebes and the care;
For herof been ther maked bokes twelve:—
But lat be this, and tel me how ye fare;
Do wey your barbe, and shew your face bare;
Do wey your book, ris up, and lat us daunce,
And lat us don to May som observaunce.”
“I? God forbede!” quod she, “Be ye mad?”
Is that a widewes lif, so God you save?
By God, ye maken me right sore adrad,
Ye ben so wilde, it semeth as ye rave!
It satte me wel bet ay in a cave
To bidde, and rede on holy seintes lives:
Lat maidens gon to daunce, and yonge wives.”
“As ever thrive I,” quod this Pandarus,
“Yet coude I telle a thing to doon you pleie.”
“Now uncle dere,” quod she, “tel it us
For Goddes love; is than the assege aweye?
I am of Grekes so fered that I deie.”
“Nay, nay,” quod he, “as ever mote I thrive!
It is a thing wel bet than swiche five.”
“Ye, holy God!” quod she, “What thing is that?
What? bet than swiche five? Ey, nay, ywis!
For al this world ne can I reden what
It sholde been; som jape, I trowe, is this.
And but yourselven telle us what it is,
My wit is for to arede it al to lene;
As help me God, I noot nat what ye mene.”
“And I your borow, ne never shal, for me,
This thing be told to yow, as mote I thrive!”
“And why so, uncle min? why so?” quod she.
“By God,” quod he, “that wole I telle as blive;
For prouder womman were ther noon on live,
And ye it wiste, in al the toun of Troye;
I jape nought, as ever have I joye!”
Tho gan she wondren more than biforn
A thousand fold, and doun hir eyen caste;
For never, sith the time that she was born,
To knowe thing desired she so faste;
And with a sik she seide him at the laste,
“Now, uncle min, I nil yow nought displese,
Nor axen more, that may do yow disese.”
So after this, with many wordes glade,
And freendly tales, and with mery chere,
Of this and that they pleide, and gunnen wade
In many an unkouth glad and deep matere,
As freendes doon, whan they ben met yfere;
Til she gan axen him how Ector ferde,
That was the tounes wal and Grekes yerde.
“Ful wel, I thanke it God,” quod Pandarus,
“Save in his arm he hath a litel wounde;
And eek his fresshe brother Troilus,
The wise worthy Ector the secounde,
In whom that every vertu list abounde,
As alle trouthe and alle gentillesse,
Wisdom, honour, fredom, and worthinesse.”
“In good feith, eem,” quod she, “that liketh me;
They faren wel, God save hem bothe two!
For trewelich I holde it greet deintee
A kinges sone in armes wel to do,
And been of good condiciouns therto;
For greet power and moral vertu here
Is selde yseye in o persone yfere.”
“In good feith, that is sooth,” quod Pandarus;
But, by my trouthe, the king hath sones tweie,
That is to mene, Ector and Troilus,
That certainly, though that I sholde deie,
They been as voide of vices, dar I seye,
As any men that liveth under the sonne,
Hir might is wide yknowe, and what they conne.
Of Ector nedeth it nought for to telle;
In al this world ther nis a bettre knight
Than he, that is of worthinesse welle;
And he wel more vertu hath than might.
This knoweth many a wis and worthy wight.
The same pris of Troilus I seye,
God help me so, I knowe not swiche tweie.”
“By God,” quod she, “of Ector that is sooth;
Of Troilus the same thing trowe I;
For dredelees, men tellen that he dooth
In armes day by day so worthily,
And bereth him her at hoom so gentilly
To every wight, that al the pris hath he
Of hem that me were levest preised be.”
“Ye sey right sooth, ywis,” quod Pandarus;
“For yesterday, whoso had with him been,
He might han wondred upon Troilus;
For never yet so thikke a swarm of been
Ne fleigh, as Grekes for him gonne fleen;
And thorugh the feld, in every wightes ere,
Ther nas no cry but ‘Troilus is there!’
“Now here, now ther, he hunted hem so faste,
Ther nas but Grekes blood; and Troilus,
Now hem he hurte, and hem al doun he caste;
Ay where he wente it was arayed thus:
He was hir deeth, and sheld and lif for us;
That as that day ther dorste noon withstonde,
Whil that he held his blody swerd in honde.
Therto he is the freendlieste man
Of grete estat, that ever I saw my live;
And wher him list, best felawshipe can
To suche as him thinketh able for to thrive.”
And with that word tho Pandarus, as blive,
He took his leve, and seide, “I wol go henne”:
“Nay, blame have I, min uncle,” quod she thenne.
“What eileth yow to be thus wery sone,
And namelich of wommen? wol ye so?
Nay, sitteth down; by God, I have to done
With yow, to speke of wisdom er ye go.”
And every wight that was aboute hem tho,
That herde that, gan fer awey to stonde,
Whil they two hadde al that hem liste in honde.
Whan that hir tale al brought was to an ende
Of hir estat and of hir governaunce,
Quod Pandarus, “now is it time I wende;
But yet, I seye, ariseth, lat us daunce,
And cast your widwes habit to mischaunce:
What list yow thus yourself to disfigure,
Sith yow is tid thus faire an aventure?”
“A! wel bithought! for love of God,” quod she,
“Shal I not witen what ye mene of this?”
“No, this thing axeth laiser,” tho quod he,
“And eek me wolde muche greve, ywis,
If I it tolde, and ye it toke amis.
Yet were it bet my tonge for to stille
Than seye a sooth that were ayeins your wille.
“For, nece, by the goddesse Minerve,
And Jupiter, that maketh the thondre ringe,
And by the blisful Venus that I serve,
Ye been the womman in this world livinge,
Withoute paramours, to my witinge,
That I best love, and lothest am to greve,
And that ye witen wel yourself, I leve.”
“Ywis, min uncle,” quod she, “grant mercy;
Your freendship have I founden evere yit;
I am to no man holden trewely
So muche as yow, and have so litel quit;
And, with the grace of God, emforth my wit,
As in my gilt I shal you nevere offende;
And if I have er this, I wol amende.
But, for the love of God, I yow beseche,
As ye ben he that I most love and triste
Lat be to me your fremde maner speche,
And sey to me, your nece, what yow liste”:
And with that word hir uncle anoon hir kiste,
And seide, “Gladly, leve nece dere,
Tak it for good that I shal sey yow here.”
With that she gan hir eyen doun to caste,
And Pandarus to coghe gan a lite,
And seide, “Nece, alwey, lo! to the laste,
Howso it be that som men hem delite
With subtil art hir tales for to endite,
Yet for al that, in hir entencioun,
Hir tale is al for som conclusioun.
“And sithen th’ende is every tales strengthe,
And this matere is so bihovely,
What sholde I peinte or drawen it on lengthe
To yow, that been my freend so feithfully?”
And with that word he gan right inwardly
Biholden hir, and loken on hir face,
And seide, “On suche a mirour goode grace!”
Than thoughte he thus, “If I my tale endite
Ought hard, or make a proces any while,
She shal no savour han therin but lite,
And trowe I wolde hir in my wil bigile.
For tendre wittes wenen al be wile
Theras they can nat pleinly understonde;
Forthi hir wit to serven wol I fonde”–
And loked on hir in a besy wise,
And she was war that he biheld hir so,
And seide, “Lord! so faste ye m’avise!
Sey ye me never er now? what sey ye, no?”
“Yes, yes,” quod he, “and bet wole er I go;
But, by my trouthe, I thoughte now if ye
Be fortunat, for now men shal it see.
“For to every wight som goodly aventure
Som time is shape, if he it can receiven;
And if that he wol take of it no cure,
Whan that it cometh, but wilfully it weiven,
Lo, neither cas nor fortune him deceiven,
But right his verray slouthe and wrecchednesse;
And swich a wight is for to blame, I gesse.
“Good aventure, O bele nece, have ye
Ful lightly founden, and ye conne it take;
And, for the love of God, and eek of me,
Cache it anoon, lest aventure slake.
What sholde I lenger proces of it make?
Yif me youre hond, for in this world is noon,
If that you list, a wight so wel begoon.
“And sith I speke of good entencioun,
As I to yow have told wel herbiforn,
And love as wel your honour and renoun
As creature in al this world yborn;
By al the othes that I have yow sworn,
And ye be wrooth therfore, or wene I lie,
Ne shal I never seen yow eft with yё.
“Beth nought agast, ne quaketh nat; wherto?
Ne chaungeth nat for fere so your hewe;
For hardely, the werste of this is do;
And though my tale as now be to yow newe,
Yet trist alwey, ye shal me finde trewe;
And were it thing that me thoughte unsittinge,
To yow wolde I no swiche tales bringe.”
“Now, my good eem, for Goddes love, I preie,”
Quod she, “com of, and tel me what it is;
For bothe I am agast what ye wol seye,
And eek me longeth it to wite, y-wis.
For whether it be wel or be amis,
Sey on, lat me not in this fere dwelle.”
“So wol I doon, now herkneth, I shal telle:
“Now, nece min, the kinges dere sone,
The goode, wise, worthy, fresshe, and free,
Which alwey for to do wel is his wone,
The noble Troilus, so loveth thee,
That, bot ye helpe, it wol his bane be.
Lo, here is al, what sholde I more seye?
Doth what yow list, to make him live or deie.
“But if ye lete him deye, I wol sterve;
Have here my trouthe, nece, I nil not lien;
Al sholde I with this knif my throte kerve.”
With that the teres breste out of his yёn,
And seide, “If that ye doon us bothe dyen,
Thus giltelees, than have ye fisshed faire;
What mende ye, though that we bothe apeire?
“Allas! he which that is my lord so dere,
That trewe man, that noble gentil knight,
That nought desireth but your frendly chere,
I see him deye, ther he goth upright,
And hasteth him, with al his fulle might,
For to be slain, if fortune wolde assente;
Allas! that God yow swich a beautee sente!
“If it be so that ye so cruel be,
That of his deeth yow liste nought to recche,
That is so trewe and worthy, as ye see,
No more than of a japere or a wrecche,
If ye be swich, your beautee may not strecche
To make amendes of so cruel a dede;
Avisement is good bifore the nede.
“Wo worth the faire gemme vertulees!
Wo worth that herbe also that dooth no bote!
Wo worth that beautee that is routhelees!
Wo worth that wight that tret ech underfote!
And ye, that been of beautee crop and rote,
If therwithal in you ther be no routhe,
Than is it harm ye liven, by my trouthe!
“And also think wel, that this is no gaude;
For me were lever, thou and I and he
Were hanged, than I sholde been his baude,
As heighe, as men mighte on us alle ysee:
I am thin eem, the shame were to me,
As wel as thee, if that I sholde assente,
Thorugh min abet, that he thin honour shente.
“Now understond, for I yow nought requere,
To binde yow to him thorugh no beheste,
But only that ye make him bettre chere
Than ye han doon er this, and more feste,
So that his lif be saved, at the leste:
This al and som, and plainly our entente;
God helpe me so, I never other mente.
“Lo, this request is not but skile, y-wis,
Ne doute of reson, pardee, is ther noon.
I set the worste, that ye dredden this,
Men wolden wondren seen him come or goon:
Ther ayeins answere I thus anoon,
That every wight, but he be fool of kinde,
Wol deme it love of freendship in his minde.
“What? who wol deme, though he see a man
To temple go, that he th’images eteth?
Thenk eek how wel and wisly that he can
Governe himself, that he no thing foryeteth,
That, wher he cometh, he pris and thank him geteth;
And eek therto, he shal come here so selde,
What fors were it though al the toun behelde?
“Swich love of freendes regneth al this toun;
And wrie yow in that mantel evermo;
And, God so wis be my savacioun,
As I have seid, your beste is to do so.
But, goode nece, alwey to stinte his wo,
So lat your daunger sucred ben a lite,
That of his deeth ye be nought for to wite.”
Criseyde, which that herde him in this wise, T
houghte, “I shal fele what he meneth, ywis.”
“Now, eem,” quod she, “what wolde ye devise,
What is your reed I sholde doon of this?”
“That is wel seid,” quod he, “certain, best is
That ye him love ayein for his lovinge,
As love for love is skilful guerdoninge.
“Thenk eek, how elde wasteth every houre
In eche of yow a party of beautee;
And therfore, er that age thee devoure,
Go love, for, old, ther wol no wight of thee.
Lat this proverbe a lore unto yow be;
‘To late ywar,’ quod Beautee, ‘whan it paste;
And elde daunteth daunger at the laste.’
“The kinges fool is wont to cryen loude,
Whan that him thinketh a womman bereth hir hiё,
‘So longe mote ye live, and alle proude,
Til crowes feet be growe under your yё,
And send yow thanne a mirour in to prië
In which that ye may see your face amorwe!’
Nece, I bidde wish yow no more sorwe.”
With this he stente, and caste adoun the heed,
And she bigan to breste awepe anoon.
And seide, “Allas, for wo! why nere I deed?
For of this world the feith is al agoon!
Allas! what sholden straunge to me doon,
When he, that for my beste freend I wende,
Ret me to love, and sholde it me defende?
“Allas! I wolde han trusted, doutelees,
That if that I, thurgh my disaventure,
Had loved other him or Achilles,
Ector, or any mannes creature,
Ye nolde han had no mercy ne mesure
On me, but alwey had me in repreve;
This false world, allas! who may it leve?
“What? is this al the joye and al the feste?
Is this your reed, is this my blisful cas?
Is this the verray mede of your beheste?
Is al this peinted proces seid, allas!
Right for this fin? O lady min, Pallas!
Thou in this dredful cas for me purveie;
For so astonied am I that I deie!”
With that she gan ful sorwfully to sike;
“A! may it be no bet?” quod Pandarus;
“By God, I shal nomore com here this wike,
And God toforn, that am mistrusted thus;
I see ful wel that ye set lite of us,
Or of our deeth! Allas! I woful wrecche!
Mighte he yet live, of me were nought to recche.
“O cruel god, O dispitouse Marte,
O furies three of helle, on yow I crie!
So lat me never out of this hous departe,
If that I mente harm or vilanie!
But sith I see my lord mot nedes die,
And I with him, here I me shrive, and seye
That wikkedly ye doon us bothe deie.
“But sith it liketh yow that I be deed,
By Neptunus, that god is of the see,
Fro this forth shal I never eten breed
Til I min owene herte blood may see;
For certain, I wole deie as sone as he.” —
And up he sterte, and on his wey he raughte,
Til she again him by the lappe caughte.
Criseyde, which that wel neigh starf for fere,
So as she was the ferfulleste wight
That mighte be, and herde eek with hir ere,
And saw the sorwful ernest of the knight,
And in his preiere eek saw noon unright,
And for the harm that mighte eek fallen more,
She gan to rewe, and dradde hir wonder sore;
And thoughte thus, “Unhappes fallen thikke
Alday for love, and in swich maner cas,
As men ben cruel in hemself and wikke;
And if this man slee here himself, allas!
In my presence, it wol be no solas.
What men wolde of it deme I can nat seye;
It nedeth me ful sleyly for to pleie.”
And with a sorwful sik she seide thrie,
“A! Lord! what me is tid a sory chaunce!
For min estat now lith in jupartie,
And eek min emes lif lith in balaunce;
But nathelees, with gode governaunce,
I shal so doon, min honour shal I kepe,
And eek his lif”; and stinte for to wepe.
“Of harmes two, the lesse is for to chese;
Yet have I lever maken him good chere
In honour, than min emes lif to lese;
Ye seyn, ye no thing elles me requere?”
“No, wis,” quod he, “min owene nece dere.”
“Now wel,” quod she, “and I wol doon my peine;
I shal min herte ayeins my lust constreine,
“But that I nil not holden him in honde,
Ne love a man, ne can I not, ne may
Ayeins my wil; but elles wol I fonde,
Min honour sauf, plese him fro day to day;
Therto nolde I nought ones have seid nay,
But that I dredde, as in my fantasie;
But cesse cause, ay cesseth maladie.
“And here I make a protestacioun,
That in this proces if ye depper go,
That certainly, for no savacioun
Of yow, though that ye sterve bothe two,
Though al the world on o day be my fo,
Ne shal I never on him han other routhe.”—
“I graunte wel,” quod Pandare, “by my trouthe.
“But may I truste wel therto,” quod he,
“That, of this thing that ye han hight me here,
Ye wol it holden trewly unto me?”
“Ye, doutelees,” quod she, “min uncle dere.”
“Ne that I shal han cause in this matere,”
Quod he, “to pleine, or after yow to preche?”
“Why, no, pardee; what nedeth more speche?”
Tho fillen they in other tales glade,
Til at the laste, “O good eem,” quod she tho,
“For love of God, which that us bothe made,
Tel me how first ye wisten of his wo:
Wot noon of it but ye?” He seide, “No.”
“Can he wel speke of love?” quod she, “I preie,
Tel me, for I the bet me shal purveie.”
Tho Pandarus a litel gan to smile,
And seide, “By my trouthe, I shal yow telle.
This other day, nought gon ful longe while,
Inwith the paleis gardin, by a welle,
Gan he and I wel half a day to dwelle,
Right for to speken of an ordenaunce,
How we the Grekes mighte disavaunce.
“Sone after that bigonne we to lepe,
And casten with our dartes to and fro,
Til at the laste he seide, he wolde slepe,
And on the gres adoun he leide him tho;
And I after gan rome to and fro
Til that I herde, as that I welk allone,
How he bigan ful wofully to grone.
Tho gan I stalke him softely bihinde,
And sikerly, the sothe for to seyne,
As I can clepe ayein now to my minde,
Right thus to Love he gan him for to pleine;
He seide, ‘Lord! have routhe upon my peine,
Al have I been rebel in min entente;
Now, mea culpa, lord! I me repente.
“ ‘O god, that at thy disposicioun
Ledest the fin, by juste purveiaunce,
Of every wight, my lowe confessioun
Accepte in gree, and send me swich penaunce
As liketh thee, but from desesperaunce,
That may my goost departe awey fro thee,
Thou be my sheld, for thy benignitee.
“ ‘For certes, lord, so sore hath she me wounded
That stod in blak, with loking of hir yën,
That to min hertes botme it is ysounded,
Thorugh which I woot that I mot nedes dyen;
This is the worste: I dar me not biwrien;
And wel the hotter been the gledes rede,
That men hem wrien with asshen pale and dede.’
With that he smoot his heed adoun anoon,
And gan to motre, I noot what, trewely.
And I with that gan stille awey to goon,
And leet therof as nothing wist hadde I,
And come ayein anoon and stood him by,
And seide, ‘Awake, ye slepen al to longe;
It semeth nat that love dooth yow longe,
“ ‘That slepen so that no man may yow wake.
Who sey evere or this so dul a man?’
‘Ye, freend,’ quod he, ‘do ye your hedes ake
For love, and lat me liven as I can.’
But though that he for wo was pale and wan,
Yet made he tho as fresh a contenaunce,
As though he shulde have led the newe daunce.
“This passed forth, til now, this other day,
It fel that I com roming al allone
Into his chaumbre, and fond how that he lay
Upon his bed; but man so sore grone
Ne herde I never, and what that was his mone,
Ne wiste I nought; for, as I was cominge,
Al sodeinly he lefte his compleininge.
“Of which I took somewhat suspecioun,
And neer I com, and fond he wepte sore;
And God so wis be my savacioun,
As nevere of thing hadde I no routhe more.
For neither with engin, ne with no lore,
Unethes mighte I fro the deth him kepe;
That yet fele I min herte for him wepe.
“And God wot, nevere, sith that I was born,
Was I so bisy no man for to preche,
Ne never was to wight so depe ysworn,
Or he me tolde who might been his leche.
But now to yow rehersen al his speche,
Or alle his woful wordes for to soune,
Ne bid me not, but ye wol see me swowne.
“But for to save his lif, and elles nought,
And to non harm of yow, thus am I driven;
And for the love of God that us hath wrought,
Swich chere him dooth, that he and I may liven.
Now have I plat to yow min herte schriven;
And sin ye woot that min entente is clene,
Tak hede therof, for I non ivel mene.
“And right good thrift, I pray to God, have ye,
That han swich oon ycaught withoute net;
And be ye wis, as ye ben fair to see,
Wel in the ring than is the ruby set.
Ther were never two so wel ymet,
Whan ye ben his al hool, as he is youre:
Ther mighty God yet graunte us see that houre!”
“Nay, therof spak I not, a, ha!” quod she,
“As help me God, ye shenden every deel!”
“O mercy, dere nece,” anoon quod he,
“Whatso I spak, I mente nought but weel,
By Mars the god, that helmed is of steel;
Now beth nought wrooth, my blood, my nece dere.”
“Now wel,” quod she, “foryeven be it here!”
With this he took his leve, and hoom he wente;
And Lord, how he was glad and wel bigoon!
Criseyde aroos, no lenger she ne stente,
But streght into hir closet wente anoon,
And sette hir doun as stille as any stoon,
And every word gan up and doun to winde,
That he had seid, as it com hir to minde;
And wex somdel astonied in hir thought,
Right for the newe cas; but whan that she
Was ful avised, tho fond she right nought
Of peril, why she oughte afered be.
For man may love, of possibilitee,
A womman so, his herte may tobreste,
And she nought love ayein, but if hir leste.
But as she sat allone and thoughte thus,
Th’ascry aroos at skarmish al withoute,
And men cride in the strete, “See, Troilus
Hath right now put to flight the Grekes route!”
With that gan al hir meinee for to shoute,
“A! go we see, caste up the yates wide;
For thurgh this strete he moot to palais ride;
“For other wey is fro the yate noon
Of Dardanus, ther open is the cheine.”
With that com he and al his folk anoon
An esy pas ridinge, in routes tweine,
Right as his happy day was, sooth to seyne,
For which, men say, may nought disturbed be
That shal bitiden of necessitee.
This Troilus sat on his baye stede,
Al armed, save his hed, ful richely,
And wounded was his hors, and gan to blede,
On whiche he rood a pas, ful softely;
But swich a knightly sighte, trewely,
As was on him, was nought, withouten faile,
To loke on Mars, that god is of bataile.
So lik a man of armes and a knight
He was to seen, fulfild of heigh prowesse;
For bothe he hadde a body and a might
To doon a thing, as wel as hardinesse;
And eek to seen him in his gere him dresse,
So fresh, so yong, so weldy semed he,
It was an heven upon him for to see.
His helm tohewen was in twenty places,
That by a tissew heng, his bak bihinde,
His sheld todasshed was with swerdes and maces,
In which men mighte many an arwe finde
That thirled hadde horn and nerf and rinde;
And ay the peple cride, “Here cometh our joye,
And, next his brother, holder up of Troye!”
For which he wex a litel reed for shame,
Whan he the peple upon him herde crien,
That to biholde it was a noble game,
How sobreliche he caste doun his yën.
Criseyda gan al his chere aspien,
And leet so softe it in hir herte sinke,
That to hirself she seid, “Who yaf me drinke?”
For of hir owene thought she wex al reed,
Remembringe hir right thus, “Lo, this is he
Which that min uncle swereth he moot be deed,
But I on him have mercy and pitee.”
And with that thought, for pure ashamed, she
Gan in hir heed to pulle, and that as faste,
Whil he and al the peple forby paste,
And gan to caste and rollen up and doun
Withinne hir thought his excellent prowesse,
And his estat, and also his renoun,
His wit, his shap, and eek his gentillesse;
But most hir favour was, for his distresse
Was al for hir, and thoughte it was a routhe
To sleen swich oon, if that he mente trouthe.
Now mighte som envious jangle thus,
“This was a sodein love, how mighte it be
That she so lightly loved Troilus
Right for the firste sighte; ye, pardee?”
Now whoso seith so, mote he never ythee!
For every thing, a ginning hath it nede
Er al be wrought, withouten any drede.
For I sey nought that she so sodeinly
Yaf him hir love, but that she gan encline
To like him first, and I have told yow why;
And after that, his manhod and his pine
Made love withinne hir for to mine,
For which, by proces and by good servise,
He gat hir love, and in no sodein wise.
And also blisful Venus, wel araied,
Sat in hir seventh hous of hevene tho,
Disposed wel, and with aspectes paied,
To helpen sely Troilus of his wo.
And, sooth to seyn, she nas nat al a fo
To Troilus in his nativitee;
God woot that wel the soner spedde he.
Now lat us stinte of Troilus a throwe,
That rideth forth, and lat us tourne faste
Unto Criseyde, that heng hir heed ful lowe,
Theras she sat allone, and gan to caste
Wheron she wolde apointe hir at the laste,
If it so were hir eem ne wolde cesse,
For Troilus, upon hir for to presse.
And, Lord! so she gan in hir thought argue
In this matere of which I have yow told,
And what to doon best were, and what eschue,
That plited she ful ofte in many fold.
Now was hir herte warm, now was it cold,
And what she thoughte somwhat shal I write,
As to min auctor listeth for to endite.
She thoughte wel, that Troilus persone
She knew by sighte and eek his gentillesse,
And thus she seide, “Al were it nought to done,
To graunte him love, yet, for his worthinesse,
It were honour, with pley and with gladnesse,
In honestee, with swich a lord to dele,
For min estat, and also for his hele.
“Eek, wel wot I my kinges sone is he;
And sith he hath to see me swich delit,
If I wolde outreliche his sighte flee,
Paraunter he mighte have me in dispit,
Thurgh which I mighte stonde in worse plit;
Now were I wis, me hate to purchace,
Withouten nede, ther I may stonde in grace?
“In every thing, I woot, ther lith mesure.
For though a man forbede dronkenesse,
He nought forbet that every creature
Be drinkelees for alwey, as I gesse;
Eek sith I woot for me is his distresse,
I ne oughte not for that thing him despise,
Yif it is so, he meneth in good wise.
“And eek I knowe, of longe time agoon,
His thewes goode, and that he is not nice.
N’avauntour, seith men, certein, is he noon;
To wis is he to do so gret a vice;
Ne als I nil him never so cherice,
That he may make avaunt, by juste cause;
He shal me never binde in swiche a clause.
“Now set a cas, the hardest is, ywis,
Men mighten deme that he loveth me:
What dishonour to min estat is this?
May I him lette of that? Why nay, pardee!
I knowe also, and alday here and see,
Men loven wommen al biside hire leve;
And whan hem leste namore lat hem leve.
“Ek wot I wel he worthy is to have
Of wommen in this world the thriftieste,
As ferforth as she may hir honour save
For out and out he is the worthieste,
Save only Ector, which that is the beste.
And yet his lif al lith now in my cure,
But swich is love, and eek min aventure.
“Ne me to love, a wonder is it nought;
For wel wot I myself, so God me spede,
Al wolde I that no man wist of my thought,
I am oon the faireste, out of drede,
And goodlieste, whoso taketh hede;
And so men seyn in al the toun of Troye.
What wonder is though he of me have joye?
“I am min owene woman, wel at ese,
I thank it God, as after min estate;
Right yong, and stonde unteid in lusty lese,
Withouten jalousie or swich debate;
Shal noon housbonde seyn to me ‘Chekmate!’
For either they ben ful of jalousie,
Or maisterful, or loven novelrie.
“What shal I doon? to what fin live I thus?
Shal I nat loven, in cas if that me leste?
What, par dieux! I am nought religious!
And though that I min herte sette at reste
Upon this knight, that is the worthieste,
And kepe alwey min honour and my name,
By alle right, it may do me no shame.”
But right as whan the sonne shineth brighte,
In March, that chaungeth ofte time his face,
And that a cloud is put with wind to flighte
Which oversprat the sonne as for a space,
A cloudy thought gan thorugh hir soule pace,
That overspradde hir brighte thoughtes alle,
So that for fere almost she gan to falle.
That thought was this, “Allas! sin I am free,
Sholde I now love, and putte in jupartie
My sikernesse, and thrallen libertee?
Allas! how dorste I thenken that folie?
May I nought wel in other folk aspie
Hir dredful joye, hir constreint, and hir peine?
Ther loveth noon, that she nath why to pleine.
“For love is yet the moste stormy lif,
Right of himself, that ever was bigonne;
For evere som mistrust, or nice strif,
Ther is in love, som cloud over that sonne:
Therto we wrecched wommen nothing conne,
Whan us is wo, but wepe and sitte and thinke;
Our wreche is this, our owene wo to drinke.
“Also these wikked tonges been so prest
To speke us harm, eek men be so untrewe,
That, right anoon as cessed is hir lest,
So cesseth love, and forth to love a newe:
But harm ydoon is doon, whoso it rewe.
For though these men for love hem first torende,
Ful sharp biginning breketh ofte at ende.
“How ofte time hath it yknowen be,
The treson, that to womman hath be do?
To what fin is swich love, I can nat see,
Or wher bicomth it, whan it is ago;
Ther is no wight that woot, I trowe so,
Wher it bicomth; lo, no wight on it sporneth;
That erst was nothing, into nought it torneth.
“How bisy, if I love, eek moste I be
To plesen hem that jangle of love, and demen,
And coye hem, that they sey non harm of me?
For though ther be no cause, yet hem semen
Al be for harm that folk hir freendes quemen;
And who may stoppen every wikked tonge,
Or soun of belles whil that they be ronge?”
And after that, hir thought gan for to clere,
And seide, “He which that nothing undertaketh,
Nothing ne acheveth, be him looth or dere.”
And with an other thought hir herte quaketh;
Than slepeth hope, and after drede awaketh;
Now hoot, now cold; but thus, bitwixen tweie,
She rist hir up, and went hir for to pleye.
Adoun the steire anoonright tho she wente
Into hir gardin, with hir neces three,
And up and doun ther made many a wente,
Flexippe, she, Tharbe, and Antigone,
To pleyen, that it joye was to see;
And othere of hir wommen, a grete route,
Hir folwede in the gardin al aboute.
This yerd was large, and railed al the aleies,
And shadwed wel with blosmy bowes grene,
Ibenched newe, and sonded al the weyes,
In which she walketh arm in arm bitwene;
Til at the laste Antigone the shene
Gan on a Trojan lay to singe clere,
That it an heven was hir vois to here.—
She seide, “O love, to whom I have and shal
Ben humble subgit, trewe in min entente,
As I best can, to yow, lord, yeve ich al
For evermore, min hertes lust to rente.
For never yet thy grace no wight sente
So blisful cause as me, my lif to lede
In alle joye and seurte, out of drede.
“Ye, blisful God, han me so wel beset
In love, ywis, that al that bereth lif
Imaginen ne coud how to ben bet;
For, lord, withouten jalousie or strif,
I love oon which that is most ententif
To serven wel, unwery or unfeined,
That ever was, and leest with harm distreined.
“As he that is the welle of worthinesse,
Of trouthe ground, mirour of goodliheed,
Of wit Appollo, stoon of sikernesse,
Of vertu rote, of lust findere and heed,
Thurgh which is alle sorwe fro me deed,
Ywis, I love him best, so doth he me;
Now good thrift have he, wherso that he be!
“Whom sholde I thanke but yow, god of love,
Of al this blisse, in which to bathe I ginne?
And thanked be ye, lord, for that I love!
This is the righte lif that I am inne,
To flemen al manere vice and sinne:
This doth me so to vertu for to entende,
That day by day I in my wille amende.
“And whoso seith that for to love is vice,
Or thraldom, though he fele in it distresse,
He outher is envious, or right nice,
Or is unmighty, for his shrewednesse,
To loven; for swich maner folk, I gesse,
Defamen love, as no thing of him knowe;
They speken, but they bent never his bowe.
“What, is the sonne wers, of kinde righte,
Though that a man, for feblesse of his yën,
May nought endure on it to see for brighte?
Or love the wers, though wrecches on it cryen?
No wele is worth, that may no sorwe dryen.
And forthi, who that hath an heed of verre,
Fro cast of stones war him in the werre!
“But I with al min herte and al my might,
As I have seid, wol love, unto my laste,
My dere herte, and al min owene knight,
In which min herte growen is so faste,
And his in me, that it shal ever laste.
Al dredde I first to love him to biginne,
Now woot I wel, ther is no peril inne.”
And of hir song right with that word she stente,
And therwithal, “Now, nece,” quod Criseyde,
“Who made this song now with so good entente?”
Antigone answerde anoon, and seide,
“Ma dame, ywis, the goodlieste maide
Of greet estat in al the toun of Troye;
And let hir lif in most honour and joye.”
“Forsothe, so it semeth by hir song,”
Quod tho Criseyde, and gan therwith to sike,
And seide, “Lord, is there swich blisse among
These loveres, as they conne faire endite?”
“Ye, wis,” quod fresh Antigone the white,
“For alle the folk that han or been on live
Ne conne wel the blisse of love discrive.
“But wene ye that every wrecche woot
The parfit blisse of love? why, nay, ywis;
They wenen al be love, if oon be hoot;
Do wey, do wey, they woot no thing of this!
Men mosten axe at seintes if it is
Aught fair in heven; why? for they kan telle;
And axen fendes, is it foul in helle.”
Criseyde unto that purpos nought answerde,
But seide, “Ywis, it wol be night as faste.”
But every word which that she of hir herde,
She gan to prenten in hir herte faste;
And ay gan love hir lasse for to agaste
Than it dide erst, and sinken in hir herte,
That she wex somwhat able to converte.
The dayes honour, and the hevenes eye,
The nightes fo, al this clepe I the sonne,
Gan westren faste, and dounward for to wrie,
As he that hadde his dayes cours yronne;
And white thinges wexen dimme and donne
For lak of light, and sterres for to appere,
That she and al hir folk in wente yfere.
So whan it liked hir to goon to reste,
And voided weren they that voiden oughte,
She seide, that to slepe wel hir leste.
Hir wommen sone unto hir bed hir broughte.
Whan al was hust, than lay she stille, and thoughte
Of al this thing the manere and the wise.
Reherce it nedeth nought, for ye ben wise.
A nightingale, upon a cedre grene,
Under the chambre wal ther as she lay,
Ful loude sang ayein the mone shene,
Paraunter, in his briddes wise, a lay
Of love, that made hire herte fresh and gay.
That herkned she so longe in good entente,
Til at the last the dede sleep hir hente.
And, as she sleep, anoonright tho hir mette,
How that an egle, fethered whit as boon,
Under hir breste his longe clawes sette,
And out hir herte he rente, and that anoon,
And dide his herte into hir brest to goon,
Of which she nought agroos ne nothing smerte,
And forth he fleigh, with herte left for herte.
Now lat hir slepe, and we our tales holde
Of Troilus, that is to paleis riden,
Fro the scarmuche, of the whiche I tolde,
And in his chambre sit, and hath abiden
Til two or three of his messages yeden
For Pandarus, and soughten him ful faste,
Til they him founde, and broughte him at the laste.
This Pandarus com leping in at ones
And seide thus, “Who hath ben wel ybete
Today with swerdes, and with slinge-stones,
But Troilus, that hath caught him an hete?”
And gan to jape, and seide, “Lord, ye swete!
But ris, and lat us soupe and go to reste.”
And he answerde, “Do we as thee leste.”
With al the haste goodly that they mighte,
They spedde hem fro the souper unto bedde;
And every wight out at the dore him dighte
And wher him list upon his wey he spedde;
But Troilus, that thoughte his herte bledde
For wo, til that he herde som tidinge,
He seide, “Freend, shal I now wepe or singe?”
Quod Pandarus, “Ly stille, and lat me slepe,
And don thin hood, thy nedes spedde be;
And chese, if thou wolt singe or daunce or lepe;
At shorte wordes, thow shalt truste in me
Sire, my nece wol do wel by thee,
And love thee best, by God and by my trouthe,
But lak of pursuit make it in thy slouthe.
“For thus ferforth I have thy work bigonne,
Fro day to day, til this day, by the morwe,
Hir love of freendship have I to thee wonne,
And also hath she leid hir feith to borwe.
Algate a foot is hameled of thy sorwe.”
What sholde I lenger sermon of it holde?
As ye han herd bifore, al he him tolde.
But right as floures, thorugh the colde of night
Yclosed, stoupen on hir stalkes lowe,
Redressen hem ayein the sonne bright,
And spreden on hir kinde cours by rowe;
Right so gan tho his eyen up to throwe
This Troilus, and seide, “O Venus dere,
Thy might, thy grace, yheried be it here!”
And to Pandare he held up bothe his hondes,
And seide, “Lord, al thin be that I have;
For I am hool, al brosten been my bondes;
A thousand Troyes who so that me yave,
Ech after other, God so me wisse and save,
Ne mighte me so gladen; lo, min herte,
It spredeth so for joye, it wol tosterte!
“But Lord, how shal I doon, how shal I liven?
Whan shal I next my dere herte see?
How shal this longe time awey be driven,
Til that thou be ayein at hir fro me?
Thou mayst answere, ‘Abid, abid,’ but he
That hangeth by the nekke, sooth to seyne,
In grete disese abideth for the peine.”
“Al esily, now, for the love of Marte,”
Quod Pandarus, “For every thing hath time;
So longe abid til that the night departe;
For al so siker as thow lyst here by me,
And God toforn, I wol be there at prime,
And for thy werk somwhat as I shal seye,
Or on som other wight this charge leye.
“For pardee, God wot, I have ever yit
Ben redy thee to serve, and to this night
Have I nought fained, but evenforth my wit
Don al thy lust, and shal with al my might.
Do now as I shal seye, and fare aright;
And if thou nilt, wite al thyself thy care,
On me is nought along thin ivel fare.
“I woot wel that thow wiser art than I
A thousand fold, but if I were as thou,
God help me so, as I wolde outrely,
Right of min owen hond, write hir right now
A lettre, in which I wolde hir tellen how
I ferde amis, and hir beseche of routhe;
Now help thyself, and leve it not for slouthe.
“And I myself shal therwith to hir goon;
And whan thou wost that I am with hir there,
Lepe thou upon a courser right anoon,
Ye, hardily, right in thy beste gere,
And rid forth by the place, as nought ne were,
And thou shalt finde us, if I may, sittinge
At som windowe, into the strete lokinge.
“And if thee list, than maystow us saluwe,
And upon me make thy contenaunce;
But, by thy lif, be war and faste eschuwe
To tarien ought, God shilde us fro mischaunce!
Rid forth thy wey, and hold thy governaunce;
And we shal speke of thee somwhat, I trowe,
Whan thou art goon, to do thine eres glowe!
“Touching thy lettre, thou art wis ynough,
I woot thow nilt it digneliche endite;
As make it with thise argumentes tough;
Ne scrivenish or craftily thou it write;
Beblotte it with thy teres eek a lite;
And if thou write a goodly word al softe,
Though it be good, reherce it not to ofte.
“For though the beste harpour upon live
Wolde on the beste souned joly harpe
That ever was, with alle his fingres five,
Touche ay o streng, or ay o werbul harpe,
Were his nailes pointed never so sharpe,
It shulde maken every wight to dulle,
To here his glee, and of his strokes fulle.
“Ne jompre eek no discordaunt thing yfere,
As thus, to usen termes of phisik
In loves termes; hold of thy matere
The forme alwey, and do that it be lik.
For if a peintour wolde peinte a pik
With asses feet, and hedde it as an ape,
It cordeth nought; so nere it but a jape.”
This counseil liked wel to Troilus;
But, as a dreedful lover, he seid this: —
“Allas, my dere brother Pandarus,
I am ashamed for to write, ywis,
Lest of min innocence I seide amis,
Or that she nolde it for despit receive;
Thanne were I deed, ther mighte it nothing weive.”
To that Pandare answerde, “If thee lest,
Do that I seye, and lat me therwith gon;
For by that Lord that formed est and west,
I hope of it to bringe answere anon
Right of hir hond, and if that thou nilt noon,
Lat be; and sory mote he been his live,
Ayeins thy lust that helpeth thee to thrive.”
Quod Troilus, “Depardieux, I assente;
Sin that thee list, I will arise and write;
And blisful God preie ich, with good entente,
The viage, and the lettre I shal endite,
So spede it; and thou, Minerva, the white,
Yif thou me wit my lettre to devise”:
And sette him doun, and wroot right in this wise. —
First he gan hir his right lady calle,
His hertes lif, his lust, his sorwes leche,
His blisse, and eek thise othere termes alle,
That in swich cas these loveres alle seche;
And in ful humble wise, as in his speche,
He gan him recomaunde unto hir grace;
To telle al how, it axeth muchel space.
And after this, ful lowly he hir praide
To be nought wrooth, though he, of his folie,
So hardy was to hir to write, and seide,
That love it made, or elles moste he die,
And pitously gan mercy for to crie;
And after that he seide, and lei ful loude,
Himself was litel worth, and lesse he coude;
And that she sholde han his conning excused,
That litel was, and eek he dredde hir so,
And his unworthinesse he ay acused;
And after that, than gan he telle his wo;
But that was endeles, withouten ho;
And seide, he wolde in trouthe alwey him holde; —
And radde it over, and gan the lettre folde.
And with his salte teres gan he bathe
The ruby in his signet, and it sette
Upon the wex deliverliche and rathe;
Therwith a thousand times, er he lette,
He kiste tho the lettre that he shette,
And seide, “Lettre, a blisful destenee
Thee shapen is, my lady shal thee see.”
This Pandar took the lettre, and that bitime
Amorwe, and to his neces paleis sterte,
And faste he swoor, that it was passed prime,
And gan to jape, and seide, “Ywis, min herte,
So fresh it is, although it sore smerte,
I may not slepe nevere a Mayes morwe;
I have a joly wo, a lusty sorwe.”
Criseyde, whan that she hir uncle herde,
With dreedful herte, and desirous to here
The cause of his cominge, thus answerde,
“Now by your feith, min uncle,” quod she, “dere,
What maner windes gideth yow now here?
Tel us your joly wo and your penaunce,
How ferforth be ye put in loves daunce.”
“By God,” quod he, “I hoppe alwey bihinde!”
And she to laugh, it thoughte hir herte breste.
Quod Pandarus, “Loke alwey that ye finde
Game in min hood, but herkneth, if yow leste;
Ther is right now come into toune a geste,
A Greek espie, and telleth newe thinges,
For which come I to telle yow tidinges.
“Into the gardin go we, and ye shal here,
Al prevely, of this a long sermoun.”
With that they wenten arm in arm yfere
Into the gardin from the chaumbre doun.
And whan that he so fer was that the soun
Of that he spake, no man here mighte,
He seide hir thus, and out the lettre plighte,
“Lo, he that is al hoolly youres free
Him recomaundeth lowly to your grace,
And sente you this lettre here by me;
Aviseth you on it, whan ye han space,
And of som goodly answer yow purchace;
Or, help me God, so pleinly for to seyne,
He may not longe liven for his peine.”
Ful dredfully tho gan she stonde stille,
And took it nought, but al hir humble chere
Gan for to chaunge, and seide, “Scrit ne bille,
For love of God, that toucheth swich matere,
Ne bringeth me noon; and also, uncle dere,
To min estat haveth more reward, I preie,
Than to his lust; what sholde I more seye?
“And loketh now if this be resonable,
And letteth nought, for favour ne for slouthe,
To seyn a sooth; now were it covenable
To min estat, by God, and by your trouthe,
To taken it, or to han of him routhe,
In harming of myself or in repreve?
Ber it ayein, for him that ye on leve!”
This Pandarus gan on hir for to stare,
And seide, “Now is this the grettest wonder
That ever I sei! lat be this nice fare!
To deethe mote I smiten be with thonder,
If, for the citee which that stondeth yonder,
Wolde I a lettre unto yow bringe or take
To harm of yow; what list yow thus it make?
“But thus ye faren, wel neigh alle and some,
That he that most desireth yow to serve,
Of him ye recche leest wher he bicome,
And whether that he live or elles sterve.
But for al that that ever I may deserve,
Refuse it nought,” quod he, and hente hir faste,
And in hir bosom the lettre doun he thraste,
And seide hir, “Now cast it away anoon,
That folk may seen and gauren on us tweie.”
Quod she, “I can abide til they be goon,”
And gan to smile, and seide him, “Em, I preie,
Swich answere as yow list yourself purveie,
For trewely I nil no lettre write.”
“No? than wol I,” quod he, “so ye endite.”
Therwith she lough, and seide, “Go we dine.”
And he gan at himself to jape faste,
And seide, “Nece, I have so greet a pine
For love, that every other day I faste”—
And gan his beste japes forth to caste;
And made hir so to laughe at his folie,
That she for laughter wende for to die.
And whan that she was comen into halle,
“Now, em,” quod she, “we wol go dine anoon”;
And gan some of hir women to hir calle,
And streight into hir chaumbre gan she goon;
But of hir besinesses, this was oon
Amonges othere thinges, out of drede,
Ful prively this lettre for to rede;
Avised word by word in every line,
And fond no lak, she thoughte he coude good;
And up it putte, and went hir in to dine.
And Pandarus, that in a study stood,
Er he was war, she took him by the hood,
And seide, “Ye were caught er that ye wiste”;
“I vouche sauf,” quod he, “do what yow liste.”
Tho wesshen they, and sette hem doun and ete;
And after noon ful sleyly Pandarus
Gan drawe him to the window next the strete,
And seide, “Nece, who hath arayed thus
The yonder hous, that stant aforyein us?”
“Which hous?” quod she, and gan for to biholde,
And knew it wel, and whos it was him tolde,
And fillen forth in speche of thinges smale,
And seten in the window bothe tweie.
Whan Pandarus saw time unto his tale,
And saw wel that hir folk were alle aweye,
“Now, nece min, tel on,” quod he, “I seye,
How liketh yow the lettre that he wrote?
Can he theron? for, by my trouthe, I noot.”
Therwith al rosy hewed tho wex she,
And gan to humme, and seide, “So I trowe.”
“Aquite him wel, for Goddes love,” quod he;
“Myself to medes wol the lettre sowe,”
And held his hondes up, and sat on knowe,
“Now, goode nece, be it never so lite,
Yif me the labour, it to sowe and plite.”
“Ye, for I can not write,” quod she tho;
“And eek I noot what I shold to him seye.”
“Nay, nece,” quod Pandare, “sey not so;
Yet at the leste thanketh him, I preie,
Of his good wil, and doth him not to deie.
Now for the love of me, my nece dere,
Refuseth not at this time my preyere.”
“Depardieux,” quod she, “God leve al be wel!
God help me so, this is the firste lettre
That ever I wroot, ye, al or any del.”
And into a closet, for t’avise hir bettre,
She wente allone, and gan hir herte unfettre
Out of disdaines prison but a lite;
And sette hir doun, and gan a lettre write,
Of which to telle in short is min entente
Th’effect, as fer as I can understonde: —
She thonked him of al that he wel mente
Towardes hir, but holden him in honde
She nolde nought, ne make hirselven bonde
In love, but as his suster, him to plese,
She wolde ay fain, to doon his herte an ese.
She shette it, and to Pandare gan goon,
There as he sat and loked into strete,
And doun she sette hir by him on a stoon
Of jaspre, upon a quisshin gold ybete,
And seide, “As wisly help me God the grete,
I never dide a thing with more peine
Than write this, to which ye me constreine.”
And took it him: he thonked hir and seide,
“God woot, of thing ful often looth bigonne
Cometh ende good; and nece min, Criseyde,
That ye to him of hard now ben ywonne
Oughte he be glad, by God and yonder sonne!
Forwhy men seith, ‘Impressiounes lighte
Ful lightly been ay redy to the flighte.’
“But ye han pleyed tiraunt neigh to longe,
And hard was it your herte for to grave;
Now stint, that ye no longer on it honge,
Al wolde ye the forme of daunger save;
But hasteth yow to doon him joye have;
For trusteth wel, to longe ydoon hardnesse
Causeth despit ful often, for distresse.”
And right as they declamed this matere,
Lo, Troilus, right at the stretes ende,
Com riding with his tenthe some yfere,
Al softely, and thiderward gan bende
Theras they sete, as was his wey to wende
To paleisward; and Pandare him aspide,
And seide, “Nece, ysee who cometh here ride!
“O flee not in, he seeth us, I suppose;
Lest he may thinke that ye him eschuwe.”
“Nay, nay,” quod she, and wex as reed as rose.
With that he gan hir humbly to saluwe,
With dreedful chere, and ofte his hewes muwe;
And up his look debonairly he caste,
And bekked on Pandare, and forth he paste.
God woot if he sat on his hors aright,
Or goodly was besein, that ilke day!
God woot wher he was lik a manly knight!
What sholde I drecche, or telle of his aray?
Criseyde, which that al these thinges say,
To telle in short, hir liked al yfere,
His persone, his aray, his look, his chere,
His goodly manere and his gentillesse,
So wel, that never, sith that she was born,
Ne hadde she swich routhe of his distresse;
And howso she hath hard ben herbiforn,
To God hope I, she hath now caught a thorn.
She shal not pulle it out this nexte wike;
God sende mo swich thornes on to pike!
Pandare, which that stood hir faste by,
Felte iren hoot, and he bigan to smite,
And seide, “Nece, I pray yow hertely,
Tel me that I shal axen yow a lite.
A womman, that were of his deeth to wite,
Withoute his gilt, but for hir lakked routhe,
Were it wel doon?” Quod she, “Nay, by my trouthe!”
“God help me so,” quod he, “ye sey me sooth.
Ye felen wel yourself that I not lie;
Lo, yond he rit!” Quod she, “Ye, so he dooth.”
“Wel,” quod Pandare, “as I have told yow thrie,
Lat be your nice shame and your folie,
And spek with him in esing of his herte;
Lat nicetee not do yow bothe smerte.”
But theron was to heven and to done;
Considered al thing, it may not be;
And why? For shame; and it were eek to sone
To graunten him so greet a libertee.
For plainly hir entente, as seide she,
Was for to love him unwist, if she mighte,
And guerdon him with no thing but with sighte.
But Pandarus thoughte, “It shal not be so,
If that I may; this nice opinioun
Shal not be holden fully yeres two.”
What sholde I make of this a long sermoun?
He moste assente on that conclusioun
As for the time; and whan that it was eve,
And al was wel, he roos and took his leve.
And on his wey ful fast homward he spedde,
And right for joye he felte his herte daunce;
And Troilus he fond alone abedde,
That lay as don these loveres, in a traunce,
Bitwixen hope and derk desesperaunce.
But Pandarus, right at his incomminge,
He song, as who seith, “Lo! sumwhat I bringe.”
And seide, “Who is in his bed so sone
Yburied thus?” “It am I, freend,” quod he.
“Who, Troilus? nay help me so the mone,”
Quod Pandarus, “thou shalt arise and see
A charme that was sent right now to thee,
The which can helen thee of thin accesse,
If thou do forth with al thy besinesse.”
“Ye, through the might of God!” quod Troilus.
And Pandarus gan him the lettre take,
And seide, “Pardee, God hath holpen us;
Have here a light, and loke on al this blake.”
But ofte gan the herte glade and quake
Of Troilus, whil that he gan it rede,
So as the wordes yave him hope or drede.
But finally, he took al for the beste
That she him wroot, for sumwhat he biheld
On which, him thoughte, he mighte his herte reste,
Al covered she the wordes under sheld.
Thus to the more worthy part he held,
That, what for hope and Pandarus biheste,
His grete wo foryede he at the leste.
But as we may alday ourselven see,
Through more wode or col, the more fir;
Right so encrees of hope, of what it be,
Therwith ful ofte encreseth eek desir;
Or, as an ook cometh of a litel spir,
So through this lettre, which that she him sente,
Encresen gan desir, of which he brente.
Wherfore I seye alwey, that day and night
This Troilus gan to desiren more
Than he dide erst, thurgh hope, and dide his might
To pressen on, as by Pandarus lore,
And writen to hir of his sorwes sore
Fro day to day; he leet it not refreide,
That by Pandare he wroot somwhat or seide;
And dide also his othere observaunces
That to a lovere longeth in this cas;
And, after that these dees turnede on chaunces,
So was he outher glad or seide “Allas!”
And held after his gestes ay his pas;
And aftir swiche answeres as he hadde,
So were his dayes sory outher gladde.
But to Pandare alwey was his recours,
And pitously gan ay til him to pleine,
And him bisoughte of rede and som socours;
And Pandarus, that sey his wode peine,
Wex wel neigh deed for routhe, sooth to seyne,
And bisily with al his herte caste
Som of his wo to sleen, and that as faste;
And seide, “Lord, and freend, and brother dere,
God woot that thy disese dooth me wo.
But woltow stinten al this woful chere,
And, by my trouthe, or it be dayes two,
And God toforn, yet shal I shape it so,
That thou shalt come into a certain place,
Theras thou mayst thyself hir preie of grace.
“And certainly, I noot if thou it wost,
But tho that been expert in love it seye,
It is oon of the thinges that furthereth most,
A man to have a leiser for to preie,
And siker place his wo for to biwreie;
For in good herte it moot som routhe impresse,
To here and see the giltles in distresse.
“Paraunter thenkestow: though it be so
That Kinde wolde doon hir to biginne
To han a maner routhe upon my wo,
Seith Daunger, ‘Nay, thou shalt me nevere winne’;
So reuleth hir hir hertes goost withinne,
That, though she bende, yet she stant on rote;
What in effect is this unto my bote?
“Thenk hereayeins, whan that the sturdy ook,
On which men hakketh ofte, for the nones,
Received hath the happy falling strook,
The grete sweigh doth it come al at ones,
As doon these rokkes or these milne stones.
For swifter cours cometh thing that is of wighte,
Whan it descendeth, than don thinges lighte.
“And reed that boweth doun for every blast,
Ful lightly, cesse wind, it wol arise;
But so nil not an ook whan it is cast;
It nedeth me nought thee longe to forbise.
Men shal rejoisen of a greet emprise
Acheved wel, and stant withouten doute,
Al han men been the lenger theraboute.
“But, Troilus, yet tel me, if thee lest,
A thing now which that I shal axen thee;
Which is thy brother that thou lovest best
As in thy verray hertes privetee?”
“Ywis, my brother Deiphebus,” quod he.
“Now,” quod Pandare, “er houres twyes twelve,
He shal thee ese, unwist of it himselve.
“Now lat m’alone, and werken as I may,”
Quod he; and to Deiphebus wente he tho
Which hadde his lord and grete freend ben ay;
Save Troilus, no man he loved so.
To telle in short, withouten wordes mo,
Quod Pandarus, “I pray yow that ye be
Freend to a cause which that toucheth me.”
“Yis, pardee,” quod Deiphebus, “wel thow wost,
In al that ever I may, and God tofore,
Al nere it but for man I love most,
My brother Troilus; but sey wherfore
It is; for sith that day that I was bore,
I nas, ne neveremo to been I thinke,
Ayeins a thing that mighte thee forthinke.”
Pandare gan him thonke, and to him seide,
“Lo, sire, I have a lady in this toun,
That is my nece, and called is Criseyde,
Which som men wolden doon oppressioun,
And wrongfully have hir possessioun:
Wherfor I of your lordship yow biseche
To been our freend, withoute more speche.”
Deiphebus him answerde, “O, is not this,
That thow spekest of to me thus straungely,
Crisëyda, my freende?” He seide, “Yis.”
“Than nedeth,” quod Deiphebus hardely,
“Namore to speke, for trusteth wel, that I
Wol be hir champioun with spore and yerde;
I roughte nought though alle hir foos it herde
“But tel me, thou that woost al this matere,
How I might best availen? now lat see.”
Quod Pandarus, “If ye, my lord so dere,
Wolden as now don this honour to me,
To prayen hir tomorwe, lo, that she
Com unto yow hir pleintes to devise,
Hir adversaries wolde of it agrise.
“And if I more dorste preie as now,
And chargen yow to have so greet travaile,
To han som of your bretheren here with yow,
That mighten to hir cause bet availe,
Than, woot I wel, she mighte never faile
For to be holpen, what at your instaunce,
What with hir othere freendes governaunce.”
Deiphebus, which that comen was of kinde
To al honour and bountee to consente,
Answerde, “It shal be doon; and I can finde
Yet gretter help to this in min entente.
What wolt thow seyn, if I for Eleine sente
To speke of this? I trowe it be the beste;
For she may leden Paris as hir leste.
“Of Ector, which that is my lord, my brother,
It nedeth nought to preie him freend to be;
For I have herd him, o time and eek other,
Speke of Criseyde swich honour, that he
May seyn no bet, swich hap to him hath she.
It nedeth nought his helpes for to crave;
He shal be swich, right as we wole him have.
“Spek thou thyself also to Troilus
On my bihalve, and pray him with us dine.”
“Sire, al this shal be doon,” quod Pandarus;
And took his leve, and never gan to fine,
But to his neces hous, as streit as line,
He com; and fond hir fro the mete arise;
And sette him doun, and spak right in this wise.
He seide, “O veray God, so have I ronne!
Lo, nece min, see ye nought how I swete?
I noot whether ye the more thank me conne.
Be ye nought war how that fals Poliphete
Is now aboute eftsones for to plete,
And bringe on yow advocacyës newe?”
“I? no,” quod she, and chaunged al hir hewe.
“What is he more aboute, me to drecche
And doon me wrong? what shal I do, allas?
Yet of himself nothing ne wolde I recche,
Nere it for Antenor and Eneas,
That been his freendes in swich maner cas;
But, for the love of God, min uncle dere,
No fors of that, lat him have al yfere;
“Withouten that, I have ynough for us.”
“Nay,” quod Pandare, “it shal no thing be so.
For I have been right now at Deiphebus,
And Ector, and mine othere lordes mo,
And shortly maked eche of hem his fo;
That, by my thrift, he shal it never winne
For ought he can, whan that so he biginne.”
And as they casten what was best to done,
Deiphebus, of his owene curtasie,
Com hir to preie, in his propre persone,
To holde him on the morwe companie
At diner, which she nolde not denie,
But goodly gan to his preiere obeie.
He thonked hir, and wente upon his weie.
Whanne this was doon, this Pandare up anoon,
To telle in short, and forth gan for to wende
To Troilus, as stille as any stoon,
And al this thing he tolde him, word and ende;
And how that he Deiphebus gan to blende;
And seide him, “Now is time, if that thou conne,
To bere thee wel tomorwe, and al is wonne.
“Now spek, now prey, now pitously compleine;
Lat not for nice shame, or drede, or slouthe;
Som time a man mot telle his owene peine;
Bileve it, and she shal han on thee routhe;
Thou shalt be saved by thy feith, in trouthe.
But wel wot I, that thou art now in drede;
And what it is, I leie, I can arede.
“Thow thinkest now, ‘How sholde I doon al this?
For by my cheres mosten folk aspie,
That for hir love is that I fare amis;
Yet hadde I lever unwist for sorwe die.’
Now think not so, for thou dost greet folie.
For I right now have founden o manere
Of sleighte, for to coveren al thy chere.
“Thow shalt gon over night, and that as blive,
Unto Deiphebus hous, as thee to pleie,
Thy maladie awey the bet to drive,
Forwhy thou semest sik, soth for to seye.
Sone after that, doun in thy bed thee leye,
And sey, thow mayst no lenger up endure,
And lie right there, and bide thin aventure.
“Sey that thy fever is wont thee for to take
The same time, and lasten til amorwe;
And lat see now how wel thou canst it make,
For, pardee, sik is he that is in sorwe.
Go now, farewel! and, Venus here to borwe,
I hope, and thou this purpos holde ferme,
Thy grace she shal fully ther conferme.”
Quod Troilus, “Ywis, thou nedelees
Counseilest me, that sikliche I me feine!
For I am sik in ernest, doutelees,
So that wel neigh I sterve for the peine.”
Quod Pandarus, “Thou shalt the bettre pleine,
And hast the lasse need to countrefete;
For him men demen hoot that men seen swete.
“Lo, holde thee at thy triste cloos, and I
Shal wel the deer unto thy bowe drive.”
Therwith he took his leve al softely,
And Troilus to paleis wente blive.
So glad ne was he nevere in al his live;
And to Pandarus reed gan al assente,
And to Deiphebus hous at night he wente.
What nedeth yow to tellen al the chere
That Deiphebus unto his brother made,
Or his accesse, or his siklich manere,
How men gan him with clothes for to lade,
Whan he was leid, and how men wolde him glade?
But al for nought, he held forth ay the wise
That ye han herd Pandare er this devise.
But certein is, er Troilus him leide,
Deiphebus had him prayed, over night,
To been a freend and helping to Criseyde.
God woot, that he it grauntede anonright,
To been hir fulle freend with al his might.
But swich a nede was to preie him thenne,
As for to bidde a wood man for to renne.
The morwen com, and neighen gan the time
Of meel tid, that the faire quene Eleine
Shoop hir to been, an houre after the prime,
With Deiphebus, to whom she nolde feine;
But as his suster, hoomly, sooth to seyne,
She com to diner in hir plain entente.
But God and Pandare wiste al what this mente.
Come eek Criseyde, al innocent of this,
Antigone, hir sister Tarbe also;
But flee we now prolixitee best is,
For love of God, and lat us faste go
Right to the effect, withoute tales mo,
Why al this folk assembled in this place;
And lat us of hir saluinges pace.
Gret honour dide hem Deiphebus, certein,
And fedde hem wel with al that mighte like.
But evermore, “Allas!” was his refrein,
“My goode brother Troilus, the sike,
Lith yet”—and therwithal he gan to sike;
And after that, he peined him to glade
Hem as he mighte, and chere good he made.
Compleined eek Eleine of his siknesse
So feithfully, that pitee was to here,
And every wight gan waxen for accesse
A leche anoon, and seide, “In this manere
Men curen folk; this charme I wol yow lere.”
But there sat oon, al list hir nought to teche,
That thoughte, “Best coude I yet been his leche.”
After compleint, him gonnen they to preise,
As folk don yet, whan som wight hath bigonne
To preise a man, and up with pris him reise
A thousand fold yet hyer than the sonne:—
“He is, he can, that fewe lordes conne.”
And Pandarus, of that they wolde afferme,
He not forgat hir preising to conferme.
Herde al this thing Criseyde wel ynough,
And every word gan for to notifie;
For which with sobre chere hir herte lough;
For who is that ne wolde hir glorifie,
To mowen swich a knight don live or die?
But al passe I, lest ye to longe dwelle;
For for o fin is al that ever I telle.
The time com fro diner for to rise,
And, as hem oughte, arisen everychoon,
And gonne a while of this and that devise.
But Pandarus brak al this speche anoon,
And seide to Deiphebus, “Wol ye goon,
If youre wille be, as I yow preide,
To speke here of the nedes of Criseyde?”
Eleine, which that by the hond hir helde,
Took first the tale, and seide, “Go we blive”;
And goodly on Criseyde she bihelde,
And seide, “Joves lat him never thrive,
That dooth yow harm, and bringe him sone of live!
And yeve me sorwe, but he shal it rewe,
If that I may, and alle folk be trewe.”
“Tel thou thy neces cas,” quod Deiphebus
To Pandarus, “For thou canst best it telle.” —
“My lordes and my ladies, it stant thus;
What sholde I lenger,” quod he, “do yow dwelle?”
He rong hem out a proces lik a belle,
Upon hir fo, that highte Poliphete,
So hëinous, that men mighte on it spete.
Answerde of this ech worse of hem than other,
And Poliphete they gonnen thus to warien,
“Anhonged be swich oon, were he my brother;
And so he shal, for it ne may not varien.”
What sholde I lenger in this tale tarien?
Pleinly, alle at ones, they hir highten,
To been hir helpe in al that ever they mighten.
Spak than Eleine, and seide, “Pandarus,
Woot ought my Lord, my brother, this matere,
I mene, Ector? or woot it Troilus?”
He seide, “Ye, but wol ye now me here?
Me thinketh this, sith Troilus is here,
It were good, if that ye wolde assente,
She tolde hirself him al this, er she wente.
“For he wole have the more hir grief at herte,
By cause, lo, that she a lady is;
And, by your leve, I wol but in right sterte,
And do yow wite, and that anoon, ywis,
If that he slepe, or wole ought here of this.”
And in he lepte, and seide him in his ere,
“God have thy soule, ybrought have I thy bere!”
To smilen of this gan tho Troilus,
And Pandarus, withoute rekeninge,
Out wente anoon to Eleine and Deiphebus,
And seide hem, “So there be no taryinge,
Ne more pres, he wol wel that ye bringe
Crisëyda, my lady, that is here;
And as he may enduren, he wol here.
“But wel ye woot, the chaumbre is but lite,
And fewe folk may lightly make it warm;
Now loketh ye (for I wol have no wite,
To bringe in prees that mighte doon him harme
Or him disesen, for my bettre arme),
Wher it be bet she bide til eftsones;
Now loketh ye, that knowen what to doon is.
“I sey for me, best is, as I can knowe,
That no wight in ne wente but ye tweie,
But it were I, for I can, in a throwe,
Reherce hir cas, unlik that she can seye;
And after this, she may him ones preie
To ben good lord, in short, and take hir leve;
This may not muchel of his ese him reve.
“And eek, for she is straunge, he wol forbere
His ese, which that him thar nought for yow;
Eek other thing, that toucheth not to here,
He wol me telle, I woot it wel right now,
That secret is, and for the tounes prow.”
And they, that no thing knewe of this entente,
Withoute more, to Troilus in they wente.
Eleine in al hir goodly softe wise,
Gan him saluwe, and womanly to pleie,
And seide, “Ywis, ye moste alweyes arise!
Now faire brother, beth al hool, I preie!”
And gan hir arm right over his sholder leie,
And him with al hir wit to recomforte;
As she best coude, she gan him to disporte.
So after this quod she, “We yow biseke,
My dere brother, Deiphebus, and I,
For love of God, and so doth Pandare eke,
To been good lord and freend, right hertely,
Unto Criseyde, which that certeinly
Receiveth wrong, as woot wel here Pandare,
That can hir cas wel bet than I declare.”
This Pandarus gan newe his tunge affile,
And al hir cas reherce, and that anoon;
Whan it was seid, sone after, in a while,
Quod Troilus, “As sone as I may goon,
I wol right fain with al my might ben oon,
Have God my trouthe, hir cause to sustene.”
“Good thrift have ye,” quod Eleyne the quene.
Quod Pandarus, “And it your wille be,
That she may take hir leve, er that she go?”
“Or elles God forbede,” tho quod he,
“If that she vouche sauf for to do so.”
And with that word quod Troilus, “Ye two,
Deiphebus, and my suster leef and dere,
To yow have I to speke of o matere,
“To been avised by your reed the bettre”:—
And fond, as hap was, at his beddes heed,
The copie of a tretis and a lettre,
That Ector hadde him sent to axen reed,
If swich a man was worthy to ben deed,
Woot I nought who—but in a grisly wise.
He preyede hem anoon on it avise.
Deiphebus gan this lettre to unfolde
In ernest greet; so did Eleine the quene;
And rominge outward, fast it gan biholde,
Downward a steire, into an herber grene.
This ilke thing they redden hem bitwene;
And largely, the mountaunce of an houre,
They gonne on it to reden and to poure.
Now lat hem rede, and turne we anoon
To Pandarus, that gan ful faste prie
That al was wel, and out he gan to goon
Into the grete chambre, and that in hie,
And seide, “God save al this companie!
Com, nece min; my lady quene Eleine
Abideth yow, and eek my lordes tweine.
“Ris, take with yow your nece Antigone,
Or whom yow list, or no fors, hardily;
The lasse prees, the bet; com forth with me,
And loke that ye thonke humblely
Hem alle three, and, whan ye may goodly
Your time ysee, taketh of hem your leve,
Lest we to longe his restes him bireve.”
Al innocent of Pandarus entente,
Quod tho Criseyde, “Go we, uncle dere”;
And arm in arm inward with him she wente,
Avised wel hir wordes and hir chere;
And Pandarus, in ernestful manere,
Seide, “Alle folk, for Goddes love, I preie,
Stinteth right here, and softely yow pleie.
Aviseth yow what folk ben here withinne,
And in what plit oon is, God him amende!
And inward thus “Ful softely biginne;
Nece, I conjure and heighly yow defende,
On his half, which that sowle us alle sende,
And in the vertue of corounes tweine,
Slee nought this man, that hath for yow this peine!
“Fi on the devel! thenk which oon he is,
And in what plit he lith; com of anoon;
Think al swich taried tid, but lost it nis!
That wol ye bothe seyn, whan ye ben oon.
Secoundelich, ther yet devineth noon
Upon yow two; com of now, if ye conne;
Whil folk is blent, lo, al the time is wonne!
“In titering, and pursuite, and delayes,
The folk devine at wagginge of a stree;
And though ye wolde han after merie dayes,
Than dar ye nought, and why? for she, and she
Spak swich a word; thus loked he, and he;
Las time iloste, I dar not with yow dele;
Com of therfore, and bringeth him to hele.”
But now to yow, ye lovers that ben here,
Was Troilus nought in a cankedort,
That lay, and mighte whispringe of hem here,
And thoughte, “O lord, right now renneth my sort
Fully to die, or han anoon comfort”;
And was the firste time he shulde hir preie
Of love; O mighty God, what shal he seye?
