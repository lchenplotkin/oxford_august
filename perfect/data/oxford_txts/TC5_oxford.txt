Aprochen gan the fatal destinee
That Joves hath in disposicioun,
And to yow, angry Parcas, sustren three,
Committeth, to don execucioun;
For which Criseyde moste out of the toun,
And Troilus shal dwelle forth in pine
Til Lachesis his threed no lenger twine.—
The golden-tressed Phebus heighe on lofte
Thryës hadde al with his bemes shene
The snowes molte, and Zephirus as ofte
Ybrought ayein the tendre leves grene,
Sin that the sone of Ecuba the quene
Bigan to love hir first, for whom his sorwe
Was al, that she departe sholde amorwe.
Ful redy was at prime Diomede,
Criseyde unto the Grekes ost to lede,
For sorwe of which she felte hir herte blede,
As she that niste what was best to rede.
And trewely, as men in bokes rede,
Men wiste never womman han the care,
Ne was so looth out of a toun to fare.
This Troilus, withouten reed or lore,
As man that hath his joyes eek forlore,
Was waitinge on his lady evermore
As she that was the soothfast crop and more
Of al his lust, or joyes heretofore.
But Troilus, now farewel al thy joye,
For shaltow never seen hir eft in Troye!
Soth is, that whil he bood in this manere,
He gan his wo ful manly for to hide,
That wel unnethe it seen was in his chere;
But at the yate ther she sholde oute ride
With certein folk, he hoved hir t’abide,
So wo bigoon, al wolde he nought him pleine,
That on his hors unnethe he sat for peine.
For ire he quook, so gan his herte gnawe,
Whan Diomede on horse gan him dresse
And seide unto himself this ilke sawe,
“Allas,” quod he, “thus foul a wrecchednesse
Why suffre ich it, why nil ich it redresse?
Were it not bet at ones for to die
Than evermore in langour thus to drie?
“Why nil I make at ones riche and pore
To have ynough to done, er that she go?
Why nil I bringe al Troye upon a rore?
Why nil I sleen this Diomede also?
Why nil I rather with a man or two
Stele hir away? Why wol I this endure?
Why nil I helpen to min owene cure?”
But why he nolde doon so fel a dede,
That shal I seyn, and why him liste it spare:
He hadde in herte alwey a maner drede,
Lest that Criseyde, in rumour of this fare,
Sholde han ben slain; lo, this was al his care.
And elles, certein, as I seide yore,
He hadde it doon, withouten wordes more.
Criseyde, whan she redy was to ride,
Ful sorwfully she sighte, and seide “Allas!”
But forth she moot, for ought that may bitide,
And forth she rit ful sorwfully a pas.
Ther nis non other remedie in this cas.
What wonder is though that hir sore smerte,
Whan she forgoth hir owene swete herte?
This Troilus, in wise of curteisie,
With hauke on hond, and with an huge route
Of knightes, rood and dide hir companie,
Passinge al the valey fer withoute.
And ferther wolde han riden, out of doute,
Ful fain, and wo was him to goon so sone;
But torne he moste, and it was eek to done.
And right with that was Antenor ycome
Out of the Grekes ost, and every wight
Was of it glad, and seide he was welcome.
And Troilus, al nere his herte light,
He peined him with al his fulle might
Him to withholde of wepinge at the leste,
And Antenor he kiste, and made feste.
And therwithal he moste his leve take,
And caste his eye upon hir pitously,
And neer he rood, his cause for to make,
To take hir by the honde al sobrely.
And Lord! so she gan wepen tendrely!
And he ful softe and sleighly gan hir seie,
“Now hold your day, and dooth me not to deie.”
With that his courser torned he aboute
With face pale, and unto Diomede
No word he spak, ne noon of al his route;
Of which the sone of Tideus took hede,
As he that coude more than the crede
In swich a craft, and by the reine hir hente;
And Troilus to Troy homwarde he wente.
This Diomede, that ladde hir by the bridel,
Whan that he saw the folk of Troye aweye,
Thoughte, “Al my labour shal not been on idel,
If that I may, for somwhat shal I seye.
For at the worste it may yet shorte our weye.
I have herd seid, eek times twiës twelve,
‘He is a fool that wol foryete himselve.’ ”
But natheles this thoughte he wel ynough,
“That certainly I am aboute nought
If that I speke of love, or make it tough;
For douteles, if she have in hir thought
Him that I gesse, he may not been ybrought
So soon awey; but I shal finde a mene,
That she not wite as yet shal what I mene.”
This Diomede, as he that coude his good,
Whan time was, gan fallen forth in speche
Of this and that, and axed why she stood
In swich disese, and gan hir eek biseche,
That if that he encrese mighte or eche
With any thing hir ese, that she sholde
Comaunde it him, and seide he doon it wolde.
For trewely he swoor hir, as a knight,
That ther nas thing with whiche he mighte hir plese,
That he nold doon his peine and al his might
To doon it, for to doon hir herte an ese.
And preyede hir, she wolde hir sorwe apese
And seide, “Ywis, we Grekes con have joye
To honouren yow, as wel as folk of Troye.”
He seide eek thus, “I woot, yow thinketh straunge,
No wonder is, for it is to yow newe,
Th’aqueintaunce of these Troyanes to chaunge,
For folk of Grece, that ye never knewe.
But wolde never God but if as trewe
A Greek ye shulde among us alle finde
As any Troian is, and eek as kinde.
“And by the cause I swer yow right, lo, now,
To been your freend, and helply, to my might,
And for that more acqueintaunce eek of yow
Have ich had than another straunger wight,
So fro this forth I pray yow, day and night,
Comaundeth me, how sore that me smerte,
To doon al that may like unto your herte;
“And that ye me wolde as your brother trete,
And taketh not my frendship in despit;
And though your sorwes be for thinges grete,
Noot I not why, but out of more respit,
Min herte hath for to amende it greet delit.
And if I may your harmes not redresse,
I am right sory for your hevinesse.
“And though ye Troians with us Grekes wrothe
Han many a day ben alwey yet, pardee,
O God of Love in sooth we serven bothe.
And, for the love of god, my lady free,
Whom so ye hate, as beth not wroth with me.
For trewely, ther can no wight yow serve,
That half so looth your wraththe wold deserve.
“And nere it that we been so neigh the tente
Of Calkas, which that seen us bothe may,
I wolde of this yow telle al min entente;
But this enseled til another day.
Yeve me your hond, I am, and shal ben ay,
God help me so, whil that my lif may dure,
Your owene aboven every creature.
“Thus seide I never er now to womman born;
For God in herte as wisly glade so,
I loved never womman herebiforn
As paramours ne never shal no mo.
And, for the love of God, beth not my fo;
Al can I not to yow, my lady dere,
Compleine aright, for I am yet to lere.
“And wondreth not, min owene lady bright,
Though that I speke of love to you thus blive;
For I have herd or this of many a wight,
Hath loved thing he never saugh his live.
Eek I am not of power for to strive
Ayens the god of Love, but him obeye
I wol alwey, and mercy I yow preye.
“Ther been so worthy knightes in this place,
And ye so fair, that everich of hem alle
Wol peinen him to stonden in your grace.
But mighte me so fair a grace falle,
That ye me for your servaunt wolde calle,
So lowly ne so trewely you serve
Nil noon of hem, as I shal, til I sterve.”
Criseyde unto that purpos lite answerde,
As she that was with sorwe oppressed so
That, in effect, she nought his tales herde,
But here and there, now here a word or two.
Hir thoughte hir sorwful herte brast atwo.
For whan she gan hir fader fer aspie,
Wel neigh doun of hir hors she gan to sie.
But natheles she thonked Diomede
Of al his travaile, and his goode chere,
And that him liste his friendship hir to bede;
And she accepteth it in good manere,
And wol do fain that is him leef and dere;
And trusten him she wolde, and wel she mighte,
As seide she, and from hir hors sh’alighte.
Hir fader hath hir in his armes nome,
And tweinty time he kiste his doughter swete,
And seide, “O dere doughter min, welcome!”
She seide eek, she was fain with him to mete,
And stood forth mewet, milde, and mansuete.
But here I leve hir with hir fader dwelle,
And forth I wol of Troilus yow telle.
To Troye is come this woful Troilus,
In sorwe aboven alle sorwes smerte,
With felon look, and face dispitous.
Tho sodeinly doun from his hors he sterte,
And thorugh his paleis, with a swollen herte,
To chambre he wente; of nothing took he hede,
Ne noon to him dar speke a word for drede.
And there his sorwes that he spared hadde
He yaf an issue large, and “Deeth!” he cride;
And in his throwes frenetik and madde
He cursed Jove, Appollo, and eek Cupide,
He cursed Ceres, Bacus, and Cipride,
His burthe, himself, his fate, and eek nature,
And, save his lady, every creature.
To bedde he goth, and weileth there and torneth
In furie, as dooth he, Ixion, in helle;
And in this wise he neigh til day sojorneth.
But tho bigan his herte a lite unswelle
Thorugh teres which that gonnen up to welle;
And pitously he cride upon Criseyde,
And to himself right thus he spak, and seide:—
“Wher is min owene lady lief and dere,
Wher is hir white brest, wher is it, where?
Wher ben hir armes and hir eyen clere,
That yesternight this time with me were?
Now may I wepe allone many a tere,
And graspe aboute I may, but in this place,
Save a pilowe, I finde nought t’enbrace.
“How shal I do? Whan shal she com ayein?
I noot, allas! why leet ich hir to go?
As wolde God, ich hadde as tho be slein!
O herte min, Criseyde, O swete fo!
O lady min, that I love and no mo!
To whom for evermo min herte I dowe;
See how I deie, ye nil me not rescowe!
“Who seeth yow now, my righte lodesterre?
Who sit right now or stant in your presence?
Who can conforten now your hertes werre?
Now I am gon, whom yeve ye audience?
Who speketh for me right now in min absence?
Allas, no wight; and that is al my care;
For wel wot I, as ivel as I ye fare.
“How shulde I thus ten dayes ful endure,
Whan I the firste night have al this tene?
How shal she doon eek, sorwful creature?
For tenderness, how shal she this sustene,
Swich wo for me? O pitous, pale, and grene
Shal been your fresshe wommanliche face
For langour, er ye torne unto this place.”
And whan he fil in any slomeringes,
Anoon biginne he sholde for to grone,
And dremen of the dredfulleste thinges
That mighte been; as, mete he were allone
In place horrible, makinge ay his mone,
Or meten that he was amonges alle
His enemis, and in hir hondes falle.
And therwithal his body sholde sterte,
And with the stert al sodeinliche awake,
And swich a tremour fele aboute his herte,
That of the feer his body sholde quake;
And therewithal he sholde a noise make,
And seme as though he sholde falle depe
From heighe alofte; and than he wolde wepe,
And rewen on himself so pitously,
That wonder was to here his fantasie.
Another time he sholde mightily
Conforte himself, and seyn it was folie,
So causeles swich drede for to drie,
And eft biginne his aspre sorwes newe,
That every man mighte on his sorwes rewe.
Who coude telle aright or ful discrive
His wo, his pleinte, his langour, and his pine?
Nought al the men that han or been onlive.
Thou, redere, mayst thyself ful wel devine
That swich a wo my wit can not define.
On idel for to write it sholde I swinke,
Whan that my wit is wery it to thinke.
On heven yet the sterres were sene,
Although ful pale ywaxen was the mone;
And whiten gan the orisonte shene
Al estward, as it woned is to done.
And Phebus with his rosy carte soone
Gan after that to dresse him up to fare,
Whan Troilus hath sent after Pandare.
This Pandar, that of al the day biforn
Ne mighte have comen Troilus to see,
Although he on his heed it hadde ysworn,
For with the king Priam alday was he,
So that it lay not in his libertee
Nowher to gon, but on the morwe he wente
To Troilus, whan that he for him sente.
For in his herte he coude wel devine,
That Troilus al night for sorwe wook;
And that he wolde telle him of his pine,
This knew he wel ynough, withoute book.
For which to chaumbre streight the wey he took,
And Troilus tho sobreliche he grette,
And on the bed ful sone he gan him sette.
“My Pandarus,” quod Troilus, “the sorwe
Which that I drie, I may not longe endure.
I trowe I shal not liven til tomorwe;
For whiche I wolde alwey, on aventure,
To thee devisen of my sepulture
The forme, and of my moeble thou dispone
Right as thee semeth best is for to done.
But of the fir and flaumbe funeral
“In which my body brenne shal to glede,
And of the feste and pleyes palestral
At my vigile, I pray thee tak good hede
That al be wel; and offre Mars my stede,
My swerd, min helm, and, leve brother dere,
My sheld to Pallas yef, that shineth clere.
“The poudre in which min herte ybrend shal torne,
That preye I thee thou take and it conserve
In a vessel, that men clepeth an urne,
Of gold, and to my lady that I serve,
For love of whom thus pitously I sterve,
So yeve it hir, and do me this plesaunce,
To preye hir kepe it for a remembraunce.
“For wel I fele, by my maladie,
And by my dremes now and yore ago,
Al certeinly, that I mot nedes die.
The owle eek, which that hight Ascaphilo,
Hath after me shright al thise nightes two.
And, god Mercurie! of me now, woful wrecche,
The soule gide, and, whan thee list, it fecche!”
Pandare answerde, and seide, “Troilus,
My dere freend, as I have told thee yore,
That it is folie for to sorwen thus,
And causeles, for whiche I can nomore.
But whoso wol not trowen reed ne lore,
I can not seen in him no remedie,
But lete him worthen with his fantasie.
“But Troilus, I pray thee tel me now,
If that thou trowe, er this, that any wight
Hath loved paramours as wel as thou?
Ye, God wot, and fro many a worthy knight
Hath his lady goon a fourtenight,
And he not yet made halvendel the fare.
What nede is thee to maken al this care?
“Sin day by day thou mayst thiselven see
That from his love, or elles from his wif,
A man mot twinnen of necessitee,
Ye, though he love hir as his owene lif;
Yet nil he with himself thus maken strif.
For wel thow wost, my leve brother dere,
That alwey freendes may nought been yfere.
“How doon this folk that seen hir loves wedded
By freendes might, as it bitit ful ofte,
And seen hem in hir spouses bed ybedded?
God woot, they take it wisly, faire and softe.
Forwhi good hope halt up hir herte onlofte,
And for they can a time of sorwe endure;
As time hem hurt, a time doth hem cure.
“So sholdestow endure, and late slide
The time, and fonde to ben glad and light.
Ten daies nis so longe not t’abide.
And sin she thee to comen hath bihight,
She nil hir hestes breken for no wight.
For dred thee not that she nil finden weye
To come ayein, my lif that dorste I leye.
“Thy swevenes eek and al swich fantasie
Drif out, and lat hem faren to mischaunce;
For they procede of thy malencolie,
That doth thee fele in sleep al this penaunce.
A straw for alle swevenes signifiaunce!
God help me so, I counte hem not a bene,
Ther woot no man aright what dremes mene.
“For prestes of the temple tellen this,
That dremes been the revelaciouns
Of goddes, and as wel they telle, ywis,
That they ben infernal illusiouns;
And leches seyn, that of complexiouns
Proceden they, or fast, or glotonie.
Who woot in sooth thus what they signifie?
“Eek othere seyn that thorugh impressiouns,
As if a wight hath faste a thing in minde,
That therof cometh swiche avisiouns;
And othere seyn, as they in bokes finde,
That, after times of the yeer by kinde,
Men dreme, and that th’effect goth by the mone;
But leve no dreem, for it is nought to done.
“Wel worth of dremes ay thise olde wives,
And treweliche eek augurie of thise foules;
For fere of which men wenen lese her lives,
As ravenes qualm, or shriking of thise oules.
To trowen on it bothe fals and foul is.
Allas, allas, so noble a creature
As is a man, shal drede swich ordure!
“For which with al min herte I thee beseche,
Unto thyself that al this thou foryive;
And ris up now withoute more speche,
And lat us caste how forth may best be drive
This time, and eek how freshly we may live
Whan that she cometh, the which shal be right sone;
God help me so, the beste is thus to done.
“Ris, lat us speke of lusty lif in Troye
That we han lad, and forth the time drive;
And eek of time cominge us rejoye,
That bringen shal our blisse now so blive;
And langour of these twyës dayes five
We shal therwith so foryete or oppresse,
That wel unnethe it doon shal us duresse.
“This toun is ful of lordes al aboute,
And trewes lasten al this mene while.
Go we pleye us in som lusty route
To Sarpedon, not hennes but a mile.
And thus thou shalt the time wel bigile,
And drive it forth unto that blisful morwe,
That thou hir see, that cause is of thy sorwe.
“Now ris, my dere brother Troilus;
For certes, it noon honour is to thee
To wepe, and in thy bed to jouken thus.
For trewely, of o thing trust to me,
If thou thus ligge a day, or two, or three,
The folk wol wene that thou, for cowardise,
Thee feinest sik, and that thou darst not rise.”
This Troilus answerde, “O brother dere,
This knowen folk that han ysuffred peine,
That though he wepe and make sorwful chere,
That feleth harm and smert in every veine,
No wonder is; and though I ever pleine,
Or alwey wepe, I am nothing to blame,
Sin I have lost the cause of al my game.
“But sin of fine force I moot arise,
I shal arise, as sone as ever I may;
And God, to whom min herte I sacrifise,
So sende us hastely the tenthe day!
For was ther never fowl so fain of May,
As I shal been, whan that she cometh in Troye,
That cause is of my torment and my joye.
“But whider is thy reed,” quod Troilus,
“That we may pleye us best in al this toun?”
“By God, my conseil is,” quod Pandarus,
“To ride and pleye us with king Sarpedoun.”
So longe of this they speken up and doun,
Til Troilus gan at the laste assente
To rise, and forth to Sarpedoun they wente.
This Sarpedoun, as he that honourable
Was ever his live, and ful of heigh largesse,
With al that mighte yserved been on table,
That deintee was, al coste it greet richesse,
He fedde hem day by day, that swich noblesse,
As seiden bothe the moste and eek the leste,
Was never er that day wist at any feste.
Nor in this world ther is non instrument
Delicious, through wind, or touche of corde,
As fer as any wight hath ever ywent,
That tonge telle or herte may recorde,
That at that feste it nas wel herd acorde;
Ne of ladies eek so fair a companie
On daunce, er tho, was never yseyn with yë.
But what availeth this to Troilus,
That for his sorwe nothing of it roughte?
For ever in oon his herte piëtous
Ful bisily Criseyde his lady soughte.
On hir was ever al that his herte thoughte.
Now this, now that, so faste imagininge,
That glade, ywis, can him no festeyinge.
These ladies eek that at this feste been,
Sin that he saw his lady was aweye,
It was his sorwe upon hem for to seen,
Or for to here on instrumentz so pleye.
For she, that of his herte berth the keye,
Was absent, lo, this was his fantasie,
That no wight sholde maken melodie.
Nor ther nas houre in al the day or night,
Whan he was theras no wight mighte him here,
That he ne seide, “O lufsom lady bright,
How have ye faren, sin that ye were here?
Welcome, ywis, min owene lady dere.”
But welaway, al this nas but a mase;
Fortune his howve entended bet to glase.
The lettres eek, that she of olde time
Hadde him ysent, he wolde allone rede,
An hundred sithe, atwixen noon and prime;
Refiguringe hir shap, hir womanhede,
Withinne his herte, and every word and dede
That passed was, and thus he droof to an ende
The ferthe day, and seide, he wolde wende.
And seide, “Leve brother Pandarus,
Intendestow that we shul here bleve
Til Sarpedoun wol forth congeyen us?
Yet were it fairer that we toke our leve.
For Goddes love, lat us now sone at eve
Our leve take, and homward lat us torne;
For trewely, I nil not thus sojorne.”
Pandare answerde, “Be we comen hider
To fecchen fir, and rennen hoom ayein?
God helpe me so, I can not tellen whider
We mighten goon, if I shal soothly seyn,
Ther any wight is of us more fain
Than Sarpedoun; and if we hennes hie
Thus sodeinly, I holde it vilanie,
“Sin that we seiden that we wolde bleve
With him a wouke; and now, thus sodeinly,
The ferthe day to take of him our leve,
He wolde wondren on it, trewely!
Lat us hold forth our purpos fermely;
And sin that ye bihighten him to bide,
Hold forward now, and after lat us ride.”
Thus Pandarus, with alle peine and wo,
Made him to dwelle; and at the woukes ende,
Of Sarpedoun they toke hir leve tho,
And on hir wey they spedden hem to wende.
Quod Troilus, “Now God me grace sende,
That I may finden, at min homcominge,
Criseyde comen!” and therwith gan he singe.
“Ye, haselwode!” thoughte this Pandare,
And to himself ful softely he seide,
“God woot, refreiden may this hote fare
Er Calkas sende Troilus Criseyde!”
But natheles, he japed thus, and seide,
And swor, ywis, his herte him wel bihighte,
She wolde come as soone as ever she mighte.
Whan they unto the paleis were ycomen
Of Troilus, they doun of hors alighte,
And to the chambre hir wey than han they nomen.
And into time that it gan to nighte,
They spaken of Crisëyde the brighte.
And after this, whan that hem bothe leste,
They spedde hem fro the soper unto reste.
On morwe, as soone as day bigan to clere,
This Troilus gan of his sleep t’abreide,
And to Pandare, his owene brother dere,
“For love of God,” ful pitously he seide,
“As go we seen the paleis of Criseyde;
For sin we yet may have namore feste,
So lat us seen hir paleis at the leste.”
And therwithal, his meine for to blende,
A cause he fond in toune for to go,
And to Criseydes hous they gonnen wende.
But lord! this sely Troilus was wo!
Him thoughte his sorweful herte braste atwo.
For whan he saugh hir dores sperred alle,
Wel neigh for sorwe adoun he gan to falle.
Therwith whan he was war and gan biholde
How shet was every windowe of the place,
As frost, him thoughte, his herte gan to colde;
For which with chaunged deedlich pale face,
Withouten word, he forth bi gan to pace;
And, as God wolde, he gan so faste ride,
That no wight of his contenaunce aspide.
Than seide he thus, “O paleis desolat,
O hous, of houses whilom best yhight,
O paleis empty and disconsolat,
O thou lanterne, of which queint is the light,
O paleis, whilom day, that now art night,
Wel oughtestow to falle, and I to die,
Sin she is went that wont was us to gie!
O paleis, whilom croune of houses alle,
Enlumined with sonne of alle blisse!
O ring, fro which the ruby is out falle,
O cause of wo, that cause hast been of lisse!
Yet, sin I may no bet, fain wolde I kisse
Thy colde dores, dorste I for this route;
And farewel shrine, of which the seint is oute!”
Therwith he caste on Pandarus his yë
With chaunged face, and pitous to biholde;
And whan he mighte his time aright aspie,
Ay as he rood, to Pandarus he tolde
His newe sorwe, and eek his joyes olde,
So pitously and with so dede an hewe,
That every wight mighte on his sorwe rewe.
Fro thennesforth he rideth up and doun,
And every thing com him to remembraunce
As he rood forth by places of the toun
In whiche he whilom hadde al his plesaunce.
“Lo, yond saugh I min owene lady daunce;
And in that temple, with hir eyen clere,
Me caughte first my righte lady dere.
“And yonder have I herd ful lustily
My dere herte laughe, and yonder pleye
Saugh I hir ones eek ful blisfully.
And yonder ones to me gan she seye,
‘Now goode swete, love me wel, I preye.’
And yond so goodly gan she me biholde,
That to the deeth min herte is to hir holde.
“And at that corner, in the yonder hous,
Herde I min alderlevest lady dere
So wommanly, with vois melodious,
Singen so wel, so goodly, and so clere,
That in my soule yet me thinketh I here
The blisful soun; and, in that yonder place,
My lady first me took unto hir grace.”
Than thoughte he thus, “O blisful lord Cupide,
Whanne I the proces have in memorie,
How thou me hast werreied on every side,
Men mighte a book make of it, lik a storie.
What nede is thee to seke on me victorie,
Sin I am thin, and holly at thy wille?
What joye hastow thin owene folk to spille?
“Wel hastow, lord, ywroke on me thin ire,
Thou mighty god, and dredful for to greve!
Now mercy, lord, thou wost wel I desire
Thy grace most, of alle lustes leve.
And live and deie I wol in thy bileve;
For which I n’axe in guerdon but a bone,
That thou Criseyde ayein me sende sone.
“Distreine hir herte as faste to retorne
As thou dost min to longen hir to see;
Than woot I wel, that she nil not sojorne.
Now, blisful lord, so cruel thou ne be
Unto the blood of Troye, I preye thee,
As Juno was unto the blood Thebane,
For which the folk of Thebes caughte hir bane.”
And after this he to the yates wente
Theras Criseyde out rood a ful good paas,
And up and doun ther made he many a wente,
And to himself ful ofte he seide “Allas!
From hennes rood my blisse and my solas!
As wolde blisful God now, for his joye,
I mighte hir seen ayein come into Troye.
“And to the yonder hille I gan hire gide
Allas! and there I took of hir my leve!
And yond I saugh hir to hir fader ride,
For sorwe of which min herte shal tocleve.
And hider hoom I com whan it was eve;
And here I dwelle outcast from alle joye,
And shal, til I may seen hir eft in Troye.”
And of himself imagined he ofte
To ben defet, and pale, and waxen lesse
Than he was wont, and that men seide softe,
“What may it be? who can the sothe gesse
Why Troilus hath al this hevinesse?”
And al this nas but his malencolie,
That he hadde of himself swich fantasie.
Another time imaginen he wolde
That every wight that wente by the weye
Had of him routhe, and that they seyen sholde,
“I am right sory Troilus wol deie.”
And thus he droof a day yet forth or tweye.
As ye have herd, swich lif right gan he lede,
As he that stood bitwixen hope and drede.
For which him liked in his songes shewe
Th’encheson of his wo, as he best mighte,
And make a song of wordes but a fewe,
Somwhat his woful herte for to lighte.
And whan he was from every mannes sighte,
With softe vois he, of his lady dere,
That absent was, gan singe as ye may here.
“O sterre, of which I lost have al the light,
With herte soor wel oughte I to bewaile,
That ever derk in torment, night by night,
Toward my deeth with wind in stere I saile;
For which the tenthe night if that I faile
The giding of thy bemes brighte an houre,
My ship and me Caribdis wol devoure.”
This song when he thus songen hadde, soone
He fil ayein into his sikes olde;
And every night, as was his wone to done,
He stood the brighte moone to beholde,
And al his sorwe he to the moone tolde;
And seide, “Ywis, whan thou art horned newe,
I shal be glad, if al the world be trewe!
I saugh thin hornes olde eek by the morwe,
Whan hennes rood my righte lady dere,
That cause is of my torment and my sorwe;
For whiche, O brighte Lucina the clere,
For love of God, ren faste aboute thy spere!
For whan thin hornes newe ginne springe,
Than shal she come, that may my blisse bringe!”
The day is more, and lenger every night,
Than they be wont to be, him thoughte tho;
And that the sonne wente his course unright
By lenger wey than it was wont to go;
And seide, “Ywis, me dredeth ever mo,
The sonnes sone, Pheton, be onlive,
And that his fadres cart amis he drive.”
Upon the walles faste eek wolde he walke,
And on the Grekes ost he wolde see,
And to himself right thus he wolde talke,
“Lo, yonder is min owene lady free,
Or elles yonder, ther tho tentes be!
And thennes comth this eir, that is so sote,
That in my soule I fele it doth me bote.
“And hardely this wind, that more and more
Thus stoundemele encreseth in my face,
Is of my ladies depe sikes sore.
I preve it thus, for in non other place
Of al this toun, save onliche in this space,
Fele I no wind that souneth so lik peine;
It seith, ‘Allas! why twinned be we tweine?’ ”
This longe time he driveth forth right thus,
Til fully passed was the ninthe night;
And ay biside him was this Pandarus,
That bisily dide alle his fulle might
Him to comforte, and make his herte light;
Yevinge him hope alwey, the tenthe morwe
That she shal come, and stinten al his sorwe.
Upon that other side eek was Criseyde,
With wommen fewe, among the Grekes stronge;
For which ful ofte a day “Allas!” she seide,
“That I was born! Wel may min herte longe
After my deeth; for now live I to longe!
Allas! and I ne may it not amende;
For now is wors than ever yet I wende.
“My fader nil for nothing do me grace
To goon ayein, for nought I can him queme;
And if so be that I my terme passe,
My Troilus shal in his herte deme
That I am fals, and so it may wel seme.
Thus shal I have unthank on every side;
That I was born, so weylawey the tide!
“And if that I me putte in jupartie,
To stele awey by nighte, and it bifalle
That I be caught, I shal be holde a spie;
Or elles, lo, this drede I most of alle,
If in the hondes of som wrecche I falle,
I am but lost, al be min herte trewe;
Now mighty God, thou on my sorwe rewe!”
Ful pale ywaxen was hir brighte face,
Hir limes lene, as she that al the day
Stood whan she dorste, and loked on the place
Ther she was born, and ther she dwelt hadde ay.
And al the night wepinge, allas! she lay.
And thus despeired, out of alle cure,
She ladde hir lif, this woful creature.
Ful ofte a day she sighte eek for destresse,
And in hirself she wente ay portrayinge
Of Troilus the grete worthinesse,
And alle his goodly wordes recordinge
Sin first that day hir love bigan to springe.
And thus she sette hir woful herte afire
Thorugh remembraunce of that she gan desire.
In al this world ther nis so cruel herte
That hir had herd compleinen in hir sorwe,
That nolde han wopen for hir peines smerte,
So tendrely she weep, bothe eve and morwe.
Hir neded none teres for to borwe.
And this was yet the worste of al hir peine:
Ther was no wight to whom she dorste hir pleine.
Ful rewfully she loked upon Troye,
Biheld the toures heighe and eek the halles;
“Allas!” quod she, “the plesaunce and the joye
The which that now al torned into galle is,
Have I hadde oft within the yonder walles!
O Troilus, what dostow now,” she seide;
“Lord! whether yet thou thenke upon Criseyde?
“Allas! I ne had trowed on your lore,
And went with yow, as ye me radde er this!
Thanne hadde I now not siked half so sore.
Who mighte have seid, that I had doon amis
To stele awey with swich on as he is?
But al to late cometh the letuarie,
Whan men the cors unto the grave carie.
“To late is now to speke of that matere;
Prudence, allas! oon of thin eyen three
Me lakked alwey, er that I cam here;
On time ypassed, wel remembred me;
And present time eek coude I wel ysee.
But futur time, er I was in the snare,
Coude I not seen; that causeth now my care.
“But natheles, bitide what bitide,
I shal tomorwe at night, by est or weste,
Out of this ost stele on som maner side,
And go with Troilus wheras him leste.
This purpos wol I holde, and this is beste.
No fors of wikked tonges janglerie,
For ever on love han wrecches had envie.
“For whoso wole of every word take hede,
Or rewlen him by every wightes wit,
Ne shal he never thriven, out of drede.
For that that som men blamen ever yit,
Lo, other maner folk commenden it.
And as for me, for al swich variaunce,
Felicitee clepe I my suffisaunce.
For which, withouten any wordes mo,
To Troye I wol, as for conclusioun.”
But God it wot, er fully monthes two,
She was ful fer fro that entencioun.
For bothe Troilus and Troye toun
Shal knotteles throughout hir herte slide;
For she wol take a purpos for t’abide.
This Diomede, of whom yow telle I gan,
Goth now, withinne himself ay arguinge
With al the sleighte and al that ever he can,
How he may best, with shortest taryinge,
Into his net Criseydes herte bringe.
To this entente he coude never fine;
To fisshen hir, he leide out hook and line.
But natheles, wel in his herte he thoughte,
That she nas nat withoute a love in Troye.
For never, sithen he hir thennes broughte,
Ne coude he seen her laughe or make joye.
He nist how best hir herte for t’acoie.
“But for t’assaie,” he seide, “it nought ne greveth;
For he that nought n’assaieth, nought n’acheveth”
Yet seide he to himself upon a night,
“Now am I not a fool, that woot wel how
Hir wo for love is of another wight,
And hereupon to goon assaye hir now?
I may wel wite, it nil not been my prow.
For wise folk in bokes it expresse,
‘Men shal not wowe a wight in hevinesse.’
“But whoso mighte winnen swich a flour
From him, for whom she morneth night and day,
He mighte seyn, he were a conquerour.”
And right anoon, as he that bold was ay,
Thoughte in his herte, “Hap, how hap may,
Al sholde I deye, I wole hir herte seche;
I shal no more lesen but my speche.”
This Diomede, as bokes us declare,
Was in his nedes prest and corageous;
With sterne vois and mighty limes square,
Hardy, testif, strong, and chevalrous
Of dedes, lik his fader Tideus.
And som men seyn, he was of tunge large;
And heir he was of Calidoine and Arge.
Criseyde mene was of hir stature,
Therto of shap, of face, and eek of chere,
Ther mighte been no fairer creature.
And ofte time this was hir manere,
To gon ytressed with hir heres clere
Doun by hir coler at hir bak bihinde,
Which with a threde of gold she wolde binde.
And, save hir browes joineden yfere,
Ther nas no lak, in ought I can espien;
But for to speken of hir eyen clere,
Lo, trewely, they writen that hir syen,
That Paradis stood formed in hir yën.
And with hir riche beautee evermore
Strof love in hir ay, which of hem was more.
She sobre was, eek simple, and wis withal,
The beste ynorisshed eek that mighte be,
And goodly of hir speche in general,
Charitable, estatliche, lusty, and free;
Ne never mo ne lakkede hir pitee;
Tendre-herted, slidinge of corage;
But trewely, I can not telle hir age.
And Troilus wel waxen was in highte,
And complet formed by proporcioun
So wel, that kinde it not amenden mighte;
Yong, fresshe, strong, and hardy as lioun;
Trewe as steel in ech condicioun;
On of the beste enteched creature,
That is, or shal, whil that the world may dure.
And certainly in storie it is yfounde,
That Troilus was never unto no wight,
As in his time, in no degree secounde
In durring don that longeth to a knight.
Al mighte a geaunt passen him of might,
His herte ay with the firste and with the beste
Stod paregal, to dur don that him leste.
But for to tellen forth of Diomede:—
It fil that after, on the tenthe day,
Sin that Criseyde out of the citee yede,
This Diomede, as fresshe as braunche in May,
Com to the tente theras Calkas lay,
And feined him with Calkas han to done;
But what he mente, I shal yow telle sone.
Criseyde, at shorte wordes for to telle,
Welcomed him, and doun by hir him sette;
And he was ethe ynough to maken dwelle.
And after this, withouten longe lette,
The spices and the win men forth hem fette;
And forth they speke of this and that yfere,
As freendes doon, of which som shal ye here.
He gan first fallen of the werre in speche
Bitwixe hem and the folk of Troye toun;
And of th’assege he gan hir eek biseche,
To telle him what was hir opinioun.
Fro that demaunde he so descendeth doun
To asken hir, if that hir straunge thoughte
The Grekes gise, and werkes that they wroughte.
And why hir fader tarieth so longe
To wedden hir unto som worthy wight.
Criseyde, that was in hir peines stronge
For love of Troilus, hir owene knight,
As ferforth as she conning hadde or might,
Answerde him tho; but, as of his entente,
It semed not she wiste what he mente.
But natheles, this ilke Diomede
Gan in himself assure, and thus he seide,
“If ich aright have taken of yow hede,
Me thinketh thus, O lady min, Criseyde,
That sin I first hond on your bridel leide,
Whan ye out come of Troye by the morwe,
Ne coude I never seen yow but in sorwe.
“Can I not seyn what may the cause be
But if for love of som Troyan it were,
The which right sore wolde athinken me
That ye, for any wight that dwelleth there,
Sholden spille a quarter of a tere,
Or pitously yourselven so bigile;
For dredelees, it is nought worth the while.
“The folk of Troye, as who seith, alle and some
In preson been, as ye yourselven see;
For thennes shal not oon on live come
For al the gold bitwixen sonne and see.
Trusteth wel, and understondeth me,
Ther shal not oon to mercy goon on live,
Al were he lord of worldes twyës five!
“Swich wreche on hem, for fecching of Eleyne,
Ther shal be take, er that we hennes wende,
That Manes, which that goddes ben of peine,
Shal been agast that Grekes wol hem shende.
And men shul drede, unto the worldes ende,
From hennes forth to ravisshe any quene,
So cruel shal our wreche on hem be sene.
“And but if Calkas lede us with ambages,
That is to seyn, with double wordes slie,
Swich as men clepe a word with two visages,
Ye shul wel knowen that I nought ne lie,
And al this thing right seen it with your yë,
And that anoon; ye nil not trow how sone;
Now taketh heed, for it is for to done.
“What wene ye your wise fader wolde
Han yeven Antenor for yow anoon,
If he ne wiste that the citee sholde
Destroyed been? Why, nay, so mote I goon!
He knew ful wel ther shal not scapen oon
That Troyan is; and for the grete fere,
He dorste not, ye dwelte lenger there.
“What wol ye more, lufsom lady dere?
Lat Troye and Troyan fro your herte pace!
Drif out that bittre hope, and make good chere,
And clepe ayein the beautee of your face,
That ye with salte teres so deface.
For Troye is brought in swich a jupartie,
That, it to save, is now no remedie.
“And thenketh wel, ye shal in Grekes finde,
A more parfit love, er it be night,
Than any Troyan is, and more kinde,
And bet to serven yow wol doon his might.
And if ye vouche sauf, my lady bright,
I wol ben he to serven yow myselve,
Ye, lever than be lord of Greces twelve!”
And with that word he gan to waxen reed,
And in his speche a litel wight he quook,
And caste aside a litel wight his heed,
And stinte a while; and afterward awook,
And sobreliche on hir he threw his look,
And seide, “I am, al be it yow no joye,
As gentil man as any wight in Troye.
“For if my fader Tideus,” he seide,
“Ylived hadde, I hadde been, er this,
Of Calidoine and Arge a king, Criseyde!
And so hope I that I shal yet, ywis.
But he was slain, allas! the more harm is,
Unhappily at Thebes al to rathe,
Polimites and many a man to scathe.
“But herte min, sin that I am your man,
And been the ferste of whom I seche grace,
To serven you as hertely as I can,
And ever shal, whil I to live have space,
So, er that I departe out of this place,
Ye wol me graunte, that I may tomorwe,
At bettre leiser, telle yow my sorwe.”
What shold I telle his wordes that he seide?
He spak ynow, for o day at the meste;
It preveth wel, he spak so that Criseyde
Graunted, on the morwe, at his requeste,
For to speken with him at the leste,
So that he nolde speke of swich matere;
And thus to him she seide, as ye may here:
As she that hadde hir herte on Troilus
So faste, that ther may it noon arace;
And straungely she spak, and seide thus:
“O Diomede, I love that ilke place
Ther I was born; and Joves, for his grace,
Delivere it soone of al that doth it care!
God, for thy might, so leve it wel to fare!
“That Grekes wolde hir wraththe on Troye wreke,
If that they mighte, I knowe it wel, ywis.
But it shal not bifallen as ye speke;
And God toforn, and ferther over this,
I wot my fader wis and redy is;
And that he me hath bought, as ye me tolde,
So dere, I am the more unto him holde.
“That Grekes been of heigh condicioun,
I woot eek wel; but certein, men shal finde
As worthy folk withinne Troye toun,
As conning, and as parfit and as kinde,
As been bitwixen Orcades and Inde.
And that ye coude wel your lady serve,
I trowe eek wel, hir thank for to deserve.
“But as to speke of love, ywis,” she seide,
“I hadde a lord, to whom I wedded was,
The whos min herte al was, til that he deide;
And other love, as help me now Pallas,
Ther in min herte nis, ne never was.
And that ye been of noble and heigh kinrede,
I have wel herd it tellen, out of drede.
“And that doth me to han so gret a wonder,
That ye wol scornen any womman so.
Eek, God wot, love and I be fer asonder;
I am disposed bet, so mote I go,
Unto my deeth, to pleine and maken wo.
What I shal after doon, I can not seye;
But trewely, as yet me list not pleye.
“Min herte is now in tribulacioun,
And ye in armes bisy, day by day.
Hereafter, whan ye wonnen han the toun,
Paraunter, thanne so it happen may,
That whan I see that I never er say,
Than wole I werke that I never wroughte!
This word to yow ynough suffisen oughte.
“Tomorwe eek wol I speken with yow fain,
So that ye touchen nought of this matere.
And whan yow list, ye may come here ayein;
And, er ye gon, thus muche I sey yow here:
As help me Pallas with hir heres clere,
If that I sholde of any Greek han routhe,
It sholde be yourselven, by my trouthe!
“I sey not therfore that I wol yow love,
Ny sey not nay, but in conclusioun,
I mene wel, by God that sit above”:—
And therwithal she caste hir eyen doun,
And gan to sike, and seide, “O Troye toun,
Yet bidde I God, in quiete and in reste
I may thee seen, or do min herte breste.”
But in effect, and shortly for to seye,
This Diomede al freshly newe ayeyn
Gan pressen on, and faste hir mercy preye;
And after this, the sothe for to seyn,
Hir glove he took, of which he was ful fain.
And finally, whan it was waxen eve,
And al was wel, he roos and took his leve.
The brighte Venus folwede and ay taughte
The wey, ther brode Phebus doun alighte;
And Cinthea hir char hors overraughte
To whirle out of the Lion, if she mighte;
And Signifer his candeles sheweth brighte,
Whan that Criseyde unto hir bedde wente
Inwith hir fadres faire brighte tente.
Retorning in hir soule ay up and doun
The wordes of this sodein Diomede,
His greet estat, and peril of the toun,
And that she was allone and hadde nede
Of freendes help; and thus bigan to brede
The cause why, the sothe for to telle,
That she tok fully purpos for to dwelle.
The morwe com, and goostly for to spek,
This Diomede is come unto Criseyde,
And shortly, lest that ye my tale breke,
So wel he for himselve spak and seide,
That alle hir sikes sore adoun he leide.
And finally, the sothe for to seyne,
He refte hir of the grete of al hir peine.
And after this the story telleth us,
That she him yaf the faire baye stede,
The which he ones wan of Troilus;
And eek a broche (and that was litel nede)
That Troilus was, she yaf this Diomede.
And eek, the bet from sorwe him to releve,
She made him were a pencel of hir sleve.
I finde eek in the stories elleswhere,
Whan through the body hurt was Diomede
Of Troilus, tho weep she many a tere,
Whan that she saugh his wide woundes blede;
And that she took to kepen him good hede,
And for to hele him of his sorwes smerte.
Men seyn, I not, that she yaf him hir herte.
But trewely, the story telleth us,
Ther made never womman more wo
Than she, whan that she falsed Troilus.
She seyde, “Allas! for now is clene ago
My name of trouthe in love, for evermo!
For I have falsed oon, the gentileste
That ever was, and oon the worthieste!
“Allas, of me, unto the worldes ende,
Shal neither been ywriten nor ysonge
No good word, for thise bokes wol me shende.
O, rolled shal I been on many a tonge;
Throughout the world my belle shal be ronge;
And wommen most wol hate me of alle.
Allas, that swich a cas me sholde falle!
“They wol seyn, in as muche as in me is,
I have hem don dishonour, weylawey!
Al be I not the first that dide amis,
What helpeth that to do my blame awey?
But sin I see there is no bettre way,
And that to late is now for me to rewe,
To Diomede algate I wol be trewe.
But Troilus, sin I no better may,
And sin that thus departen ye and I,
Yet preye I God, so yeve yow right good day
As for the gentileste, trewely,
That ever I say, to serven feithfully,
And best can ay his lady honour kepe”:—
And with that word she brast anon to wepe.
“And certes, yow ne haten shal I never,
And freendes love, that shal ye han of me,
And my good word, al sholde I liven ever.
And, trewely, I wolde sory be
For to seen yow in adversitee.
And giltelees, I woot wel, I yow leve;
But al shal passe; and thus take I my leve.”
But trewely, how longe it was bitwene,
That she forsook him for this Diomede,
Ther is non auctor telleth it, I wene.
Take every man now to his bokes hede;
He shal no terme finden, out of drede.
For though that he bigan to wowe hir sone,
Er he hir wan, yet was ther more to done.
Ne me ne list this sely womman chide
Ferther than the story wol devise.
Hir name, allas! is publisshed so wide,
That for hir gilt it oughte ynow suffise.
And if I mighte excuse hir any wise,
For she so sory was for hir untrouthe,
Ywis, I wolde excuse hir yet for routhe.
This Troilus, as I biforn have told,
Thus driveth forth, as wel as he hath might.
But often was his herte hoot and cold,
And namely, that ilke ninthe night,
Which on the morwe she hadde him bihight
To come ayein: God wot, ful litel reste
Hadde he that night; nothing to slepe him leste.
The laurer-crouned Phebus, with his hete,
Gan, in his course ay upward as he wente,
To warmen of the est see the wawes wete;
And Nisus doughter song with fresh entente,
Whan Troilus his Pandare after sente;
And on the walles of the toun they pleide,
To loke if they can seen ought of Criseyde.
Til it was noon, they stoden for to see
Who that ther come; and every maner wight,
That cam fro fer, they seiden it was she,
Til that they coude knowen him aright.
Now was his herte dul, now was it light;
And thus bijaped stonden for to stare
Aboute nought, this Troilus and Pandare.
To Pandarus this Troilus tho seide,
“For ought I wot, bifor noon, sikerly,
Into this toun ne comth nought here Criseyde.
She hath ynow to done, hardily,
To twinnen from hir fader, so trowe I;
Hir olde fader wol yet make hir dine
Er that she go; God yeve his herte pine!”
Pandare answerde, “It may wel be, certein;
And forthi lat us dine, I thee biseche;
And after noon than mayst thou come ayein.”
And hoom they go, withoute more speche;
And come ayein, but longe may they seche
Er that they finde that they after cape;
Fortune hem bothe thenketh for to jape.
Quod Troilus, “I see wel now, that she
Is taried with hir olde fader so,
That er she come, it wol neigh even be.
Com forth, I wol unto the yate go.
Thise porters been unkonninge ever mo;
And I wol doon hem holden up the yate
As nought ne were, although she come late.”
The day goth faste, and after that comth eve,
And yet com nought to Troilus Criseyde.
He loketh forth by hegge, by tree, by greve,
And fer his heed over the wal he leide.
And at the laste he torned him, and seide,
“By God, I woot hir mening now, Pandare!
Almost, ywis, al newe was my care.
“Now douteles, this lady can hir good;
I woot, she meneth riden prively.
I comende hir wisdom, by min hood!
She wol not maken peple nicely
Gaure on hir, whan she comth; but softely
By nighte into the toun she thenketh ride.
And, dere brother, thenk not long t’abide.
“We han nought elles for to don, ywis.
And Pandarus, now woltow trowen me?
Have here my trouthe, I see hir! yond she is.
Heve up thin eyen, man! maystow not see?”
Pandare answerde, “Nay, so mote I thee!
Al wrong, by God; what seystow, man, wher art?
That I see yond nis but a fare-cart.”
“Allas, thou seist right sooth,” quod Troilus;
“But hardely, it is not al for nought
That in min herte I now rejoise thus.
It is ayeins som good I have a thought.
Noot I not how, but sin that I was wrought,
Ne felte I swich a confort, dar I seye;
She comth tonight, my lif, that dorste I leye!”
Pandare answerde, “It may be, wel ynough”;
And held with him of al that ever he seide;
But in his herte he thoughte, and softe lough,
And to himself ful sobrely he seide:
“From haselwode, ther Joly Robin pleide,
Shal come al that that thou abidest here;
Ye, farewel al the snow of ferne yere!”
The wardein of the yates gan to calle
The folk which that without the yates were,
And bad hem driven in hir bestes alle,
Or al the night they moste bleven there.
And fer within the night, with many a tere,
This Troilus gan hoomward for to ride;
For wel he seeth it helpeth nought t’abide.
But natheles, he gladded him in this:
He thoughte he misacounted hadde his day,
And seide, “I understonde have al amis.
For thilke night I last Criseyde say,
She seide, ‘I shal ben here, if that I may,
Er that the mone, O dere herte swete!
The Lion passe, out of this Ariete.’
“For which she may yet holde al hir biheste.”
And on the morwe unto the yate he wente,
And up and down, by west and eek by este,
Upon the walles made he many a wente.
But al for nought; his hope alwey him blente;
For which at night, in sorwe and sikes sore
He wente him hoom, withouten any more.
His hope al clene out of his herte fledde,
He nath wheron now lenger for to honge;
But for the peine him thoughte his herte bledde,
So were his throwes sharpe and wonder stronge.
For when he saugh that she abood so longe,
He niste what he juggen of it mighte,
Sin she hath broken that she him bihighte.
The thridde, ferthe, fifte, sixte day
After tho dayes ten, of which I tolde,
Bitwixen hope and drede his herte lay,
Yet somwhat trustinge on hir hestes olde.
But whan he saugh she nolde hir terme holde,
He can now seen non other remedie,
But for to shape him sone for to die.
Therwith the wikked spirit, God us blesse,
Which that men clepeth wode Jalousie,
Gan in him crepe, in al this hevinesse;
For which, bicause he wolde soone die,
He ne eet ne dronk, for his malencolie,
And eek from every companie he fledde;
This was the lif that al the time he ledde.
He so defet was, that no maner man
Unneth him mighte knowe ther he wente;
So was he lene, and therto pale and wan,
And feble, that he walketh by potente;
And with his ire he thus himselven shente.
And whoso axed him wherof him smerte,
He seide, his harm was al aboute his herte.
Priam ful ofte, and eek his moder dere,
His bretheren and his sustren gonne him freine
Why he so sorwful was in al his chere,
And what thing was the cause of al his peine.
But al for nought; he nolde his cause pleine,
But seide, he felte a grevous maladie
Aboute his herte, and fain he wolde die.
So on a day he leide him doun to slepe,
And so bifel that in his sleep him thoughte,
That in a forest faste he welk to wepe
For love of hir that him these peines wroughte;
And up and doun as he the forest soughte,
He mette he saugh a boor with tuskes grete,
That slepte ayein the brighte sonnes hete.
And by this boor, faste in his armes folde,
Lay kissing ay his lady bright Criseyde:
For sorwe of which, whan he it gan biholde,
And for despit, out of his slepe he breide,
And loude he cried on Pandarus, and seide,
“O Pandarus, now knowe I crop and rote!
I nam but deed, ther nis non other bote!
“My lady bright Criseyde hath me bitrayed,
In whom I trusted most of any wight,
She elleswhere hath now hir herte apaied;
The blisful goddes, through hir grete might,
Han in my dreem yshewed it ful right.
Thus in my dreem Criseyde I have biholde”—
And al this thing to Pandarus he tolde.
“O my Criseyde, allas! what subtiltee,
What newe lust, what beaute, what science,
What wratthe of juste cause have ye to me?
What gilt of me, what fel experience
Hath fro me raft, allas! thin advertence?
O trust, O feith, O depe asëuraunce,
Who hath me reft Criseyde, al my plesaunce?
Allas! why leet I you from hennes go,
For which wel neigh out of my wit I breide?
Who shal now trowe on any othes mo?
God wot I wende, O lady bright, Criseyde,
That every word was gospel that ye seide!
But who may bet bigilen, if him liste,
Than he on whom men weneth best to triste?
What shal I doon, my Pandarus, allas!
I fele now so sharpe a newe peine,
Sin that ther is no remedie in this cas,
That bet were it I with min hondes tweine
Myselven slow, than alwey thus to pleine.
For through my deeth my wo sholde han an ende,
Ther every day with lif myself I shende.”
Pandare answerde and seide, “Allas the while
That I was born; have I not seid er this,
That dremes many a maner man bigile?
And why? for folk expounden hem amis.
How darstow seyn that fals thy lady is,
For any dreem, right for thin owene drede?
Lat be this thought, thou canst no dremes rede.
Paraunter, ther thou dremest of this boor,
It may so be that it may signifie
Hir fader, which that old is and eek hoor,
Ayein the sonne lith, on point to die,
And she for sorwe ginneth wepe and crie,
And kisseth him, ther he lith on the grounde;
Thus shuldestow thy dreem aright expounde.”
“How mighte I thanne do?” quod Troilus,
“To knowe of this, ye, were it never so lite?”
“Now seystow wisly,” quod this Pandarus,
“My reed is this, sin thou canst wel endite,
That hastely a lettre thou hir write,
Thorugh which thou shalt wel bringen it aboute,
To knowe a sooth of that thou art in doute.
“And see now why; for this I dar wel seyn,
That if so is that she untrewe be,
I can not trow that she wol write ayein.
And if she write, thou shalt ful sone see,
As whether she hath any libertee
To come ayein, or elles in som clause,
If she be let, she wol assigne a cause.
“Thou hast not writen hir sin that she wente,
Nor she to thee, and this I dorste leye,
Ther may swich cause been in hir entente,
That hardely thou wolt thyselven seye,
That hir abood the beste is for yow tweie.
Now write hir thanne, and thou shalt fele sone
A sothe of al; ther is no more to done.”
Acorded been to this conclusioun,
And that anoon, these ilke lordes two;
And hastely sit Troilus adoun,
And rolleth in his herte to and fro,
How he may best discriven hir his wo.
And to Criseyde, his owene lady dere,
He wroot right thus, and seide as ye may here.
“Right fresshe flour, whos I have been and shal,
Withouten part of elleswhere servise,
With herte, body, lif, lust, thought, and al;
I, woful wight, in every humble wise
That tonge telle or herte may devise,
As ofte as matere occupieth place,
Me recomaunde unto your noble grace.
“Liketh it yow to witen, swete herte,
As ye wel knowe how longe time agoon
That ye me lafte in aspre peines smerte,
Whan that ye wente, of which yet bote noon
Have I non had, but ever wers bigoon
Fro day to day am I, and so mot dwelle,
While it yow list, of wele and wo my welle!
“For which to yow, with dredful herte trewe,
I write, as he that sorwe drifth to write,
My wo, that every houre encreseth newe,
Compleininge as I dar or can endite.
And that defaced is, that may ye wite
The teres, which that fro min eyen reine,
That wolde speke, if that they coude, and pleine.
“Yow first biseche I, that your eyen clere
To look on this defouled ye not holde;
And over al this, that ye, my lady dere,
Wol vouchesauf this lettre to biholde.
And by the cause eek of my cares colde,
That sleeth my wit, if ought amis m’asterte,
Foryeve it me, min owene swete herte.
“If any servant dorste or oughte of right
Upon his lady pitously compleine,
Than wene I, that ich oughte be that wight,
Considered this, that ye these monthes tweine
Han taried, ther ye seiden, sooth to seyne,
But dayes ten ye nolde in ost sojourne,
But in two monthes yet ye not retourne.
“But forasmuche as me mot nedes like
Al that yow list, I dar not pleine more,
But humbely with sorwful sikes sike;
Yow write ich min unresty sorwes sore,
Fro day to day desiring evermore
To knowen fully, if your wil it were,
How ye han ferd and doon, whil ye be there.
“The whos welfare and hele eek God encresse
In honour swich that upward in degree
It growe alwey, so that it never cesse;
Right as your herte ay can, my lady free,
Devise, I prey to God so mote it be.
And graunte it that ye soone upon me rewe
As wisly as in al I am yow trewe.
“And if yow liketh knowen of the fare
Of me, whos wo ther may no wight discrive,
I can no more but, cheste of every care,
At writinge of this lettre I was onlive,
Al redy out my woful gost to drive;
Which I delaye, and holde him yet in honde,
Upon the sight of matere of your sonde.
“Min eyen two, in vein with which I see,
Of sorweful teres salte arn waxen welles;
My song, in pleinte of min adversitee;
My good, in harm; min ese eek waxen helle is.
My joye, in wo; I can sey yow nought elles,
But turned is, for which my lif I warie,
Everich joye or ese in his contrarie.
“Which with your coming hoom ayein to Troye
Ye may redresse, and, more a thousand sithe
Than ever ich hadde, encressen in me joye.
For was ther never herte yet so blithe
To han his lif, as I shal been as swithe
As I yow see; and, though no maner routhe
Commeve yow, yet thinketh on your trouthe.
“And if so be my gilt hath deeth deserved,
Or if you list no more upon me see,
In guerdon yet of that I have you served,
Biseche I yow, min hertes lady free,
That hereupon ye wolden write me,
For love of God, my righte lodesterre,
“Ther deeth may make an ende of al my werre.
If other cause aught doth yow for to dwelle,
That with your lettre ye me recomforte;
For though to me your absence is an helle,
With pacience I wol my wo comporte.
And with your lettre of hope I wol desporte.
Now writeth, swete, and lat me thus not pleine;
With hope, or deeth, delivereth me fro peine.
“Ywis, min owene dere herte trewe,
I woot that, whan ye next upon me see,
So lost have I min hele and eek min hewe,
Criseyde shal nought conne knowe me!
Ywis, min hertes day, my lady free,
So thursteth ay min herte to biholde
Your beautee, that my lif unnethe I holde.
“I sey no more, al have I for to seye
To you wel more than I telle may;
But whether that ye do me live or deye,
Yet pray I God, so yeve yow right good day.
And fareth wel, goodly faire fresshe may,
As ye that lif or deeth me may comaunde;
And to your trouthe ay I me recomaunde,
“With hele swich that, but ye yeven me
The same hele, I shal noon hele have.
In you lith, whan yow list that it so be,
The day in which me clothen shal my grave.
In yow my lif, in yow might for to save
Me from disese of alle peines smerte;
And fare now wel, min owene swete herte!
This lettre forth was sent unto Criseyde,
Of which hir answere in effect was this;
Ful pitously she wroot ayein, and seide,
That also sone as that she might, ywis,
She wolde come, and mende al that was mis.
And finally she wroot and seide him thanne,
She wolde come, ye, but she niste whanne.
But in hir lettre made she swich festes,
That wonder was, and swereth she loveth him best,
Of which he fond but botmelees bihestes.
But Troilus, thou mayst now, est or west,
Pipe in an ivy leef, if that thee lest;
Thus gooth the world; God shilde us fro mischaunce,
And every wight that meneth trouthe avaunce!
Encresen gan the wo fro day to night
Of Troilus, for taryinge of Criseyde;
And lessen gan his hope and eek his might,
For which al doun he in his bed him leide;
He ne eet, ne dronk, ne sleep, ne word he seide,
Imagininge ay that she was unkinde;
For which wel neigh he wex out of his minde.
This dreem, of which I told have eek biforn,
May never come out of his remembraunce;
He thoughte ay wel he hadde his lady lorn,
And that Joves, of his purveiaunce,
Him shewed hadde in sleep the signifiaunce
Of hir untrouthe and his disaventure,
And that the boor was shewed him in figure.
For which he for Sibille his suster sente,
That called was Cassandre eek al aboute;
And al his dreem he tolde hir er he stente,
And hir bisoughte assoilen him the doute
Of the stronge boor, with tuskes stoute;
And finally, withinne a litel stounde,
Cassandre him gan right thus his dreem expounde.
She gan first smile, and seide, “O brother dere,
If thou a sooth of this desirest knowe,
Thou most a fewe of olde stories here,
To purpos, how that fortune overthrowe
Hath lordes olde; through which, withinne a throwe,
Thou wel this boor shalt knowe, and of what kinde
He comen is, as men in bokes finde.
“Diane, which that wrooth was and in ire
For Grekes nolde doon hir sacrifise,
Ne encens upon hir auter sette afire,
She, for that Grekes gonne hir so dispise,
Wrak hir in a wonder cruel wise.
For with a boor as greet as oxe in stalle
She made up frete hir corn and vines alle.
“To slee this boor was al the contree reised,
Amonges which ther com, this boor to see,
A maide, oon of this world the best ypreised;
And Meleagre, lord of that contree,
He loved so this fresshe maiden free
That with his manhod, er he wolde stente,
This boor he slow, and hir the heed he sente;
“Of which, as olde bokes tellen us,
Ther roos a contek and a greet envie;
And of this lord descended Tideus
By ligne, or elles olde bokes lie;
But how this Meleagre gan to die
Thorugh his moder, wol I yow not telle,
For al to long it were for to dwelle.”
She toldë eek how Tideus, er she stente,
Unto the stronge citee of Thebes,
To cleime kingdom of the citee, wente,
For his felawe, daun Polimites,
Of which the brother, daun Ethiocles
Ful wrongfully of Thebes held the strengthe;
This tolde she by proces, al by lengthe.
Associat profugum Tideo primus Polimitem;
Tidea legatum docet insidiasque secundus;
Tercius Hemoniden canit et vates latitantes;
Quartus habet reges ineuntes prelia septem;
Mox furie Lenne quinto narratur et anguis;
Archimori bustum sexto ludique leguntur;
Dat Graios Thebes et vatem septimus umbris;
Octauo cecidit Tideus, spes, vita Pelasgis;
Ypomedon nono moritur cum Parthonopeo;
Fulmine percussus, decimo Capaneus superatur;
Vndecimo sese perimunt per vulnera fratres;
Argiuam flentem narrat duodenus et ignem.
[The first (book) joins exiled Tideus with Polynices;
the second describes Tideus, the ambassador, and
the ambush; the third sings of Haemon and the
prophets in hiding; the fourth describes the seven
kings going into combat; afterwards, in the fifth,
the furies of Lemnos are described; in the sixth the
cremation of Archemous and the games are read
about; the seventh consigns the Greeks to Thebes
and the prophet to the shadows; in the eighth,
Tideus, hope, life of the Pelasgians, fell; in the ninth
Ypomedon dies with Parthenopaeus; struck by
lightening, Capaneus is overcome in the tenth; in
the eleventh brothers annihilate each other with
wounds; in the twelfth describes weeping Argia and fire.]
She tolde eek how Hemonides asterte,
Whan Tideus slough fifty knightes stoute.
She told eek al the prophesies by herte,
And how that seven kinges, with hir route,
Bisegeden the citee al aboute;
And of the holy serpent, and the welle,
And of the furies, al she gan him telle.
Of Archimoris buryinge and the pleies,
And how Amphiorax fil through the grounde,
How Tideus was slain, lord of Argeies,
And how Ypomedoun in litel stounde
Was dreint, and deed Parthonope of wounde;
And also how Cappanëus the proude
With thonder dint was slain, that cride loude.
She gan eek telle him how that either brother,
Ethiocles and Polimite also,
At a scarmiche, eche of hem slough other,
And of Argives wepinge and hir wo;
And how the town was brent she tolde eek tho.
And so descendeth doun from gestes olde
To Diomede, and thus she spak and tolde.
“This ilke boor bitokneth Diomede,
Tideus sone, that doun descended is
Fro Meleagre, that made the boor to blede.
And thy lady, wherso she be, ywis,
This Diomede hir herte hath, and she his.
Weep if thou wolt, or leef; for, out of doute,
This Diomede is inne, and thou art oute.”
“Thou seist nat sooth,” quod he, “thou sorceresse,
With al thy false goost of prophesie!
Thou wenest been a greet devineresse;
Now seestow not this fool of fantasie
Peineth hir on ladies for to lie?
Awey,” quod he, “ther Joves yeve thee sorwe!
Thou shalt be fals, paraunter, yet tomorwe!
“As wel thou mightest lyen on Alceste,
That was of creatures, but men lie,
That ever weren, kindest and the beste.
For whanne hir housbonde was in jupartie
To die himself, but if she wolde die,
She chees for him to die and go to helle,
And starf anoon, as us the bokes telle.”
Cassandre goth, and he with cruel herte
Foryat his wo, for angre of hir speche;
And from his bed al sodeinly he sterte,
As though al hool him hadde ymad a leche.
And day by day he gan enquere and seche
A sooth of this, with al his fulle cure;
And thus he dryeth forth his aventure.
Fortune, which that permutacioun
Of thinges hath, as it is hir committed
Through purveiaunce and disposicioun
Of heighe Jove, as regnes shal ben flitted
Fro folk in folk, or whan they shal ben smitted,
Gan pulle awey the fetheres brighte of Troye
Fro day to day, til they ben bare of joye.
Among al this, the fin of the parodie
Of Ector gan approchen wonder blive;
The fate wolde his soule sholde unbodie,
And shapen hadde a mene it out to drive;
Ayeins which fate him helpeth not to strive;
But on a day to fighten gan he wende,
At which, allas! he caughte his lives ende.
For which me thinketh every maner wight
That haunteth armes oughte to biwaile
The deeth of him that was so noble a knight;
For as he drough a king by th’aventaile,
Unwar of this, Achilles through the maile
And through the body gan him for to rive;
And thus this worthy knight was brought of live.
For whom, as olde bokes tellen us,
Was mad swich wo, that tonge it may not telle;
And namely, the sorwe of Troilus,
That next him was of worthinesse welle.
And in this wo gan Troilus to dwelle,
That, what for sorwe, and love, and for unreste,
Ful ofte a day he bad his herte breste.
But natheles, though he gan him dispeire,
And dradde ay that his lady was untrewe,
Yet ay on hir his herte gan repeire.
And as these loveres doon, he soughte ay newe
To gete ayein Criseyde, bright of hewe.
And in his herte he wente hir excusinge,
That Calkas causede al hir taryinge.
And ofte time he was in purpos grete
Himselven lik a pilgrim to disgise,
To seen hir; but he may not contrefete
To been unknowen of folk that weren wise,
Ne finde excuse aright that may suffise,
If he among the Grekes knowen were;
For which he weep ful ofte many a tere.
To hir he wroot yet ofte time al newe
Ful pitously, he lefte it nought for slouthe,
Biseching hir that, sin that he was trewe,
She wolde come ayein and holde hir trouthe.
For which Criseyde upon a day, for routhe,
I take it so, touchinge al this matere,
Wrot him ayein, and seide as ye may here.
“Cupides sone, ensample of goodlihede,
O swerd of knighthod, sours of gentilesse!
How mighte a wight in torment and in drede
And helelees, yow sende as yet gladnesse?
I hertelees, I sike, I in distresse;
Sin ye with me, nor I with yow may dele,
Yow neither sende ich herte may nor hele.
“Your lettres ful, the papir al ypleinted,
Conseived hath min hertes piëtee;
I have eek seyn with teres al depeinted
Your lettre, and how that ye requeren me
To come ayein, which yet ne may not be.
But why, lest that this lettre founden were,
No mencioun ne make I now, for fere.
“Grevous to me, God woot, is your unreste,
Your haste, and that, the goddes ordenaunce,
It semeth not ye take it for the beste.
Nor other thing nis in your remembraunce,
As thinketh me, but only your plesaunce.
But beth not wrooth, and that I yow biseche;
For that I tarie, is al for wikked speche.
“For I have herd wel more than I wende,
Touchinge us two, how thinges han ystonde;
Which I shal with dissimulinge amende.
And beth nought wrooth, I have eek understonde,
How ye ne doon but holden me in honde.
But now no fors, I can not in yow gesse
But alle trouthe and alle gentilesse.
“Comen I wol, but yet in swich disjointe
I stonde as now, that what yeer or what day
That this shal be, that can I not apointe.
But in effect, I prey yow, as I may,
Of your good word and of your frendship ay.
For trewely, whil that my lif may dure,
As for a freend, ye may in me assure.
“Yet preye I yow on ivel ye ne take,
That it is short which that I to yow write;
I dar not, ther I am, wel lettres make,
Ne never yet ne coude I wel endite.
Eek greet effect men write in place lite.
Th’entente is al, and nought the lettres space;
And fareth now wel, God have you in his grace!
LA VOSTRE C.”
This Troilus this lettre thoughte al straunge,
Whan he it saugh, and sorwefully he sighte;
Him thoughte it lik a kalendes of chaunge;
But finally, he ful ne trowen mighte
That she ne wolde him holden that she highte;
For with ful ivel wil list him to leve
That loveth wel, in swich cas, though him greve.
But natheles, men seyn that, at the laste,
For any thing, men shal the sothe see;
And swich a cas bitidde, and that as faste,
That Troilus wel understood that she
Nas not so kinde as that hir oughte be.
And finally, he woot now, out of doute,
That al is lost that he hath been aboute.
Stood on a day in his malencolie
This Troilus, and in suspecioun
Of hir for whom he wende for to die.
And so bifel, that throughout Troye toun,
As was the gise, ybore was up and doun
A maner cote armure, as seith the storie,
Biforn Deiphebe, in signe of his victorie,
The whiche cote, as telleth Lollius,
Deiphebe it hadde yrent from Diomede
The same day; and whan this Troilus
It saugh, he gan to taken of it hede,
Avising of the lengthe and of the brede,
And al the werk; but as he gan biholde,
Ful sodeinly his herte gan to colde,
As he that on the coler fond withinne
A broche, that he Criseyde yaf that morwe
That she from Troye moste nedes twinne,
In remembraunce of him and of his sorwe;
And she him leide ayein hir feith to borwe
To kepe it ay; but now, ful wel he wiste,
His lady nas no lenger on to triste.
He gooth him hoom, and gan ful soone sende
For Pandarus; and al this newe chaunce,
And of this broche, he tolde him word and ende,
Compleininge of hir hertes variaunce,
His longe love, his trouthe, and his penaunce;
And after deeth, withouten wordes more,
Ful faste he cride, his reste him to restore.
Than spak he thus, “O lady min Criseyde,
Wher is your feith, and wher is your biheste?
Wher is your love, wher is your trouthe,” he seide;
“Of Diomede have ye now al this feste!
Allas, I wolde have trowed at the leste,
That, sin ye nolde in trouthe to me stonde,
That ye thus nolde han holden me in honde!
“Who shal now trowe on any othes mo?
Allas, I never wolde han wend, er this,
That ye, Criseyde, coude han chaunged so;
Ne, but I hadde agilt and doon amis,
So cruel wende I not your herte, ywis,
To slee me thus; allas, your name of trouthe
Is now fordoon, and that is al my routhe.
“Was ther non other broche yow liste lete
To feffe with your newe love,” quod he,
“But thilke broche that I, with teres wete,
Yow yaf, as for a remembraunce of me?
Non other cause, allas, ne hadde ye
But for despit, and eek for that ye mente
Al outrely to shewen your entente!
“Through which I see that clene out of your minde
Ye han me cast, and I ne can nor may,
For al this world, within min herte finde
To unloven yow a quarter of a day!
In cursed time I born was, weylaway!
That ye, that doon me al this wo endure,
Yet love I best of any creature.
“Now God,” quod he, “me sende yet the grace
That I may meten with this Diomede!
And trewely, if I have might and space,
Yet shal I make, I hope, his sides blede.
O God,” quod he, “that oughtest taken hede
To fortheren trouthe, and wronges to punice,
Why niltow doon a vengeaunce on this vice?
“O Pandare, that in dremes for to triste
Me blamed hast, and wont art ofte upbreide,
Now maystow see thyselve, if that thee liste,
How trewe is now thy nece, bright Criseyde!
In sondry formes, God it woot,” he seide,
“The goddes shewen bothe joye and tene
In slepe, and by my dreme it is now sene.
“And certainly, withoute more speche,
From hennesforth, as ferforth as I may,
Min owene deeth in armes wol I seche;
I recche not how soone be the day!
But trewely, Criseyde, swete may,
Whom I have ay with al my might yserved,
That ye thus doon, I have it nought deserved.”
This Pandarus, that al these thinges herde,
And wiste wel he seide a sooth of this,
He nought a word ayein to him answerde;
For sory of his frendes sorwe he is,
And shamed, for his nece hath doon amis;
And stant, astoned of these causes tweye,
As stille as stoon; a word ne coude he seye.
But at the laste thus he spak, and seide,
“My brother dere, I may thee do no more.
What shulde I seyn? I hate, ywis, Criseyde!
And God wot, I wol hate hir evermore!
And that thou me bisoughtest doon of yore,
Havinge unto min honour ne my reste
Right no reward, I dide al that thee leste.
If I dide ought that mighte liken thee,
It is me leef; and of this treson now,
God woot, that it a sorwe is unto me!
And dredelees, for hertes ese of yow,
Right fain wolde I amende it, wiste I how.
And fro this world, almighty God I preye,
Delivere hir soon; I can no more seye.”
Gret was the sorwe and pleint of Troilus;
But forth hir cours fortune ay gan to holde.
Criseyde loveth the sone of Tideus,
And Troilus mot wepe in cares colde.
Swich is this world; whoso it can biholde,
In eche estat is litel hertes reste;
God leve us for to take it for the beste!
In many cruel bataile, out of drede,
Of Troilus, this ilke noble knight,
As men may in these olde bokes rede,
Was sene his knighthod and his grete might.
And dredelees, his ire, day and night,
Ful cruelly the Grekes ay aboughte;
And alwey most this Diomede he soughte.
And ofte time, I finde that they mette
With blody strokes and with wordes grete,
Assayinge how hir speres weren whette;
And God it woot, with many a cruel hete
Gan Troilus upon his helm to bete.
But natheles, fortune it nought ne wolde,
Of otheres hond that either deyen sholde.—
And if I hadde ytaken for to write
The armes of this ilke worthy man,
Than wolde I of his batailles endite.
But for that I to write first bigan
Of his love, I have seid as that I can.
His worthy dedes, whoso list hem here,
Reed Dares, he can telle hem alle yfere.
Bisechinge every lady bright of hewe,
And every gentil womman, what she be,
That al be that Criseyde was untrewe,
That for that gilt she be not wrooth with me.
Ye may hir gilt in othere bokes see;
And gladlier I wol writen, if yow leste,
Penelopeës trouthe and good Alceste.
Ny sey not this al only for these men,
But most for wommen that bitraised be
Through false folk; God yeve hem sorwe, amen!
That with hir grete wit and subtiltee
Bitraise yow! and this commeveth me
To speke, and in effect yow alle I preye,
Beth war of men, and herkeneth what I seye!—
Go litel book, my litel tragedie,
Ther God thy maker yet, er that he die,
So sende might to make som comedie!
But litel book, no making thou n’envie,
But subgit be to alle poesie;
And kis the steppes, wheras thou seest pace
Virgile, Ovide, Omer, Lucan, and Stace.
And for ther is so greet diversitee
In English and in writing of our tonge,
So preye I God that noon miswrite thee,
Ne thee mismetre for defaute of tonge.
And red wherso thou be, or elles songe,
That thou be understond God I beseche!
But yet to purpos of my rather speche.—
The wraththe, as I began yow for to seye,
Of Troilus, the Grekes boughten dere;
For thousandes his hondes maden deie,
As he that was withouten any pere,
Save Ector, in his time, as I can here.
But weilaway, save only Goddes wille,
Dispitously him slough the fiers Achille.
And whan that he was slain in this manere,
His lighte goost ful blisfully is went
Up to the holownesse of the seventh spere,
In convers letinge every element;
And ther he saugh, with ful avisement,
The erratik sterres, herkeninge armonie
With sownes fulle of hevenish melodie.
And doun from thennes faste he gan avise
This litel spot of erthe, that with the see
Enbraced is, and fully gan despise
This wrecched world, and held al vanitee
To respect of the plein felicitee
That is in hevene above; and at the laste,
Ther he was slain, his loking doun he caste;
And in himself he lough right at the wo
Of hem that wepten for his deeth so faste;
And dampned al our werk that folweth so
The blinde lust, the which that may not laste,
And sholden al our herte on heven caste.
And forth he wente, shortly for to telle,
Ther as Mercurie sorted him to dwelle.—
Swich fin hath, lo, this Troilus for love,
Swich fin hath al his grete worthinesse;
Swich fin hath his estat real above,
Swich fin his lust, swich fin hath his noblesse;
Swich fin hath false worldes brotelnesse.
And thus bigan his lovinge of Criseyde,
As I have told, and in this wise he deide.
O yonge fresshe folkes, he or she,
In which that love up groweth with your age,
Repeireth hoom from worldly vanitee,
And of your herte upcasteth the visage
To thilke God that after his image
Yow made, and thinketh al nis but a faire
This world, that passeth soone as floures faire.
And loveth him, the which that right for love
Upon a cros, our soules for to beye,
First starf, and roos, and sit in hevene above;
For he nil falsen no wight, dar I seye,
That wol his herte al hoolly on him leie.
And sin he best to love is, and most meke,
What nedeth feined loves for to seke?
Lo here, of payens corsed olde rites,
Lo here, what alle hir goddes may availle;
Lo here, these wrecched worldes appetites;
Lo here, the fin and guerdon for travaille
Of Jove, Appollo, of Mars, of swich rascaille!
Lo here, the forme of olde clerkes speche
In poetrie, if ye hir bokes seche.—
O moral Gower, this book I directe
To thee, and thee philosophical Strode,
To vouchen sauf, ther nede is, to corecte,
Of your benignitees and zeles goode.
And to that sothfast Crist, that starf on rode,
With al min herte of mercy ever I preye;
And to the Lord right thus I speke and seye:
Thou oon, and two and thre eterne on live,
That regnest ay in thre and two and oon,
Uncircumscript and al maist circumscrive
Us from visible and invisible foon
Defende, and to thy mercy everichone
So make us, Jesus, for thi mercy digne
For love of maide and modir thin benigne.
