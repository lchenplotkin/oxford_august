This maiden bright Cecilie, as hir lif seith,
Was comen of Romains,° and of noble kinde,°
And from hir cradel up fostred° in the feith
Of Crist, and bar his gospel in hir minde;
She never cessed, as I writen finde,
Of hir preyere, and God to love and drede,
Biseking him to kepe hir maidenhede.°

And when this maiden sholde unto a man
Ywedded be, that was ful yong of age,
Which that ycleped° was Valerian,
And day was comen of hir mariage,
She, ful devout and humble in hir corage,°
Under hir robe of gold, that sat ful faire,
Had next hir flesh yclad° hir in an heire.°

And whil the organs maden melodie,
To God alone in herte thus sang she;
“O Lord, my soule and eek° my body gie°
Unwemmed,° lest that I confounded° be”:
And, for his love that deide upon a tree,°
Every seconde or thridde day she faste,°
Ay biddinge° in hir orisons° ful faste.°

The night cam, and to bedde most° she gon
With hir housbonde, as ofte is the manere,
And prively to him she seide anon,
“O swete and wel biloved spouse dere,
Ther is a conseil,° and° ye wolde it here,
Which that right fain° I wolde unto yow seye,
So that° ye swere ye shul me nat biwreye.”°

Valerian gan faste° unto hir swere,
That for no cas, ne thing that mighte be,
He sholde nevermo biwreyen here;
And thanne at erst° to him thus seide she,
“I have an angel which that loveth me,
That with greet love, wherso° I wake or slepe,
Is redy ay my body for to kepe.°

“And if that he may felen, out of drede,°
That ye me touche or love in vileinie,°
He right anon wol slee° yow with the dede,
And in your yowthe thus ye shulden die;
And if that ye in clene love me gie,°
He wol yow loven as me, for your clennesse,°
And shewen yow his joye and his brightnesse.”

Valerian, corrected as God wolde,°
Answerde again, “If I shal trusten thee,
Lat me that angel se, and him biholde;
And if that it a verray° angel be,
Than wol I doon as thou hast preyed me;
And if thou love another man, for sothe°
Right with this swerd than wol I slee yow bothe.”

Cecile answerde anon right in this wise,
“If that yow list,° the angel shul ye see,
So that° ye trowe° on Crist and yow baptise.°
Goth forth to Via Apia,” quod she,
“That fro this toun ne stant but miles three,
And, to the povre° folkes that ther dwelle,
Sey hem right thus, as that I shal yow telle.

“Telle hem that I, Cecile, yow to hem sente,
To shewen yow the gode° Urban the olde,
For secree nedes° and for good entente.
And whan that ye Seint Urban han biholde,
Telle him the wordes whiche I to yow tolde;
And whan that he hath purged yow fro sinne,
Than shul ye see that angel, er ye twinne.”°

Valerian is to the place ygon,
And right as him was taught by his lerninge,°
He fond this holy olde Urban anon
Among the seintes buriels° lotinge.°
And he anon, withouten taryinge,°
Dide° his message; and whan that he it tolde,
Urban for joye his hondes gan up holde.

The teres from his yën° leet he falle—
“Almighty lord, o Jesu Crist,” quod he,
“Sower of chast° conseil, herde° of us alle,
The fruit of thilke seed of chastitee
That thou hast sowe in Cecile, tak to thee!
Lo, lik a bisy bee, withouten gile,°
Thee serveth ay thin owene thral° Cecile!

“For thilke° spouse, that she took but now
Ful lik a fiers° leoun, she sendeth here,
As meke as ever was any lamb, to yow!”
And with that worde, anon ther gan appere
An old man, clad in white clothes clere,
That hadde a book with lettre of golde in honde,
And gan biforn Valerian to stonde.

Valerian as deed fil doun for drede
Whan he him saugh, and he up hente° him tho,°
And on his book right thus he gan to rede—
“Oo° Lord, oo feith, oo God withouten mo,
Oo Cristendom, and fader of alle also,
Aboven alle over al everywhere”—
Thise wordes al with gold ywriten were.

Whan this was rad,° than seid this olde man,
“Levestow° this thing or no? sey ye or nay.”
“I leve al this thing,” quod Valerian,
“For other thing than this, I dar wel say,
Under the heven no wight° thinke may.”
Tho vanisshed the olde man, he niste° where,
And Pope Urban him cristened° right there.

Valerian goth hoom, and fint° Cecilie
Withinne his chambre with an angel stonde;
This angel hadde of rose and of lilie
Corones two, the which he bar in honde;
And first to Cecile, as I understonde,
He yaf that oon, and after gan he take
That other to Valerian, hir make.°

“With body clene and with unwemmed° thoght
Kepeth ay wel thise corones,” quod he;
“Fro Paradis to yow have I hem broght,
Ne nevermo ne shal they roten° be,
Ne lese° her sote° savour, trusteth me;
Ne never wight shal seen hem with his yë,
But he be chaast° and hate vileinyë.°

“And thou, Valerian, for thou so sone
Assentedest to good conseil also,
Sey what thee list,° and thou shalt han thy bone.”°
“I have a brother,” quod Valerian tho,
“That in this world I love no man so.
I pray yow that my brother may han grace
To know the trouthe, as I do in this place.”

The angel seide, “God liketh thy requeste,
And bothe, with the palm of martirdom,
Ye shullen come unto his blisful feste.”°
And with that word Tiburce his brother com.
And whan that he the savour undernom°
Which that the roses and the lilies caste,
Withinne his herte he gan to wondre faste,°

And seide, “I wondre, this time of the yeer,
Whennes that sote savour° cometh so
Of rose and lilies that I smelle heer.
For though I hadde hem in min hondes two,
The savour mighte in me no depper go.
The sote smel that in min herte I finde
Hath chaunged me al in another kinde.”°

Valerian seid, “Two corones han we,
Snow-white and rose-reed, that shinen clere,
Which that thin yën han no might° to see;
And as thou smellest hem, thurgh my preyere
So shaltow seen hem, leve° brother dere,
If it so be thou wolt, withouten slouthe,
Bileve aright and knowen verray trouthe.”

Tiburce answerde, “Seistow this to me
In soothnesse, or in dreem I herkne this?”
“In dremes,” quod Valerian, “han we be
Unto this time, brother min, ywis.°
But now at erst° in trouthe our dwelling is.”
“How woostow° this,” quod Tiburce, “in what wise?”°
Quod Valerian, “That shal I thee devise.°

“The angel of God hath me the trouthe ytaught
Which thou shalt seen, if that thou wolt reneye°
The idoles and be clene,° and elles naught.”—
And of the miracle of thise corones tweye
Seint Ambrose in his preface list to seye;
Solempnely this noble doctour dere
Commendeth it, and seith in this manere:

The palm of martirdom for to receive,
Seinte Cecile, fulfild of Goddes yifte,°
The world and eek hir chambre gan she weive;°
Witnes° Tiburces and Valerians shrifte,°
To which God of his bountee wolde shifte°
Corones two of floures wel smellinge,
And made his angel hem the corones bringe:

The maide hath broght thise men to blisse above
The world hath wist° what it is worth, certein,
Devocioun of chastitee to love.
Tho shewede him Cecile al open and plein
That alle idoles nis but a thing in vein;°
For they been dombe,° and therto they been deve,°
And charged him his idoles for to leve.°

“Who so that troweth° nat this, a beste° he is,”
Quod tho Tiburce, “If that I shal nat lie.”
And she gan kisse his brest, that herde this,
And was ful glad he coude trouthe espie.
“This day I take thee for min allie,”°
Seid this blisful faire maide dere;
And after that she seide as ye may here:

“Lo, right so as the love of Crist,” quod she,
“Made me thy brotheres wif, right in that wise
Anon for min allie heer take I thee,
Sin that thou wolt thin idoles despise.
Go with thy brother now, and thee baptise,
And make thee clene; so that thou mowe° biholde
The angels face of which thy brother tolde.”

Tiburce answerde and seide, “Brother dere,
First tel me whider° I shal,° and to what man?”
“To whom?” quod he, “Com forth with right good chere,
I wol thee lede unto the pope Urban.”
“Til Urban? brother min Valerian,”
Quod tho Tiburce, “woltow me thider lede?
Me thinketh that it were a wonder dede.

“Ne menestow° nat Urban,” quod he tho,
“That is so ofte dampned to be deed,
And woneth° in halkes° alwey to and fro,
And dar° nat ones putte forth his heed?
Men sholde him brennen° in a fir so reed
If he were founde, or that° men mighte him spie;
And we also, to bere him companie—

“And whil we seken thilke° divinitee
That is yhid in heven prively,
Algate° ybrend° in this world shul we be!”
To whom Cecile answerde boldely,
“Men mighten dreden wel and skilfully°
This lif to lese, min owene dere brother,
If this were livinge only and non other.

“But ther is better lif in other place,
That never shal be lost, ne drede thee° noght,
Which Goddes sone us tolde thurgh his grace;
That fadres sone hath alle thinges wroght;
And al that wroght is with a skilful° thoght,
The goost,° that fro the fader gan precede,
Hath sowled hem,° withouten any drede.°

“By word and by miracle Goddes sone,
Whan he was in this world, declared here
That ther was other lif ther men may wone.”°
To whom answerde Tiburce, “O suster dere,
Ne seidestow right now in this manere,
Ther nis but o God, lord in soothfastnesse;
And now of three how maystow bere witnesse?”

“That shal I telle,” quod she, “er I go.
Right as a man hath sapiences° three,
Memorie, engin,° and intellect also,
So, in o° being of divinitee,
Three persones may ther right wel be.”
Tho gan she him ful bisily to preche
Of Cristes come° and of his peines teche,

And many pointes of his passioun;
How Goddes sone in this world was withholde,°
To doon mankinde plein remissioun,°
That was ybounde in sinne and cares colde:°
Al this thing she unto Tiburce tolde.
And after this Tiburce, in good entente,
With Valerian to pope Urban he wente,

That thanked God; and with glad herte and light°
He cristned him, and made him in that place
Parfit° in his lerninge, Goddes knight.
And after this Tiburce gat swich° grace,
That every day he saugh, in time and space,
The angel of God; and every maner bone°
That he God axed,° it was sped ful sone.°

It were ful hard by ordre for to seyn
How many wondres Jesus for hem wroghte;
But atte laste, to tellen short and plein,
The sergeants of the toun of Rome hem soghte,
And hem biforn Almache the prefect broghte,
Which hem apposed,° and knew al hir entente,°
And to the image of Jupiter hem sente,

And seide, “Who so wol nat sacrifise,
Swap° of his heed, this is my sentence° here.”
Anon thise martirs that I yow devise,°
Oon Maximus, that was an officere
Of the prefectes and his corniculere,°
Hem hente;° and whan he forth the seintes ladde,
Himself he weep, for pitee that he hadde.

Whan Maximus had herd the seintes lore,°
He gat him of the tormentoures leve,°
And ladde hem to his hous withoute more;°
And with hir preching, er that it were eve,
They gonnen fro the tormentours to reve,°
And fro Maxime, and fro his folk echone
The false feith, to trowe° in God allone.

Cecilie cam, whan it was woxen night,°
With preestes that hem cristned alle yfere;°
And afterward, whan day was woxen light,°
Cecile hem seide with a ful sobre chere,°
“Now, Cristes owene knightes leve° and dere,
Caste alle awey the werkes of derknesse,
And armeth yow in armure of brightnesse.

“Ye han for sothe ydoon a greet bataille,
Your cours is doon, your feith han ye conserved,
Goth to the corone of lif that may nat faille;
The rightful juge, which that ye han served,
Shall yeve° it yow, as ye han it deserved.”
And whan this thing was seid as I devise,°
Men ladde hem forth to doon the sacrifise.

But whan they weren to the place broght,
To tellen shortly the conclusioun,
They nolde° encense° ne sacrifice right noght,
But on hir knees they setten hem adoun
With humble herte and sad° devocioun,
And losten bothe hir hedes in the place.
Hir soules wenten to the king of grace.

This Maximus, that saugh this thing bitide,°
With pitous teres tolde it anonright,
That he hir soules saugh to heven glide
With angels ful of cleernesse and of light,
And with his word converted many a wight;°
For which Almachius dide him so bete
With whippe of leed, til he his lif gan lete.°

Cecile him took and buried him anoon
By Tiburce and Valerian softely,°
Withinne hir burying place, under the stoon.
And after this Almachius hastily
Bad his ministres fecchen openly
Cecile, so that she mighte in his presence
Doon sacrifice,° and Jupiter encense.

But they, converted at hir wise lore,
Wepten ful sore, and yaven° ful credence
Unto hir word, and criden more and more,
“Crist, Goddes sone withouten difference,
Is verray God, this is al our sentence,°
That hath so good a servant him to serve;
This with o vois we trowen,° thogh we sterve!”°

Almachius, that herde of this doinge,
Bad fecchen° Cecile, that he might hir see,
And alderfirst, lo! this was his axinge,
“What maner womman artow?” tho quod he.
“I am a gentil° womman born,” quod she.
“I axe thee,” quod he, “thogh it thee greve,
Of thy religioun and of thy bileve.”

“Ye han bigon your question folily,”°
Quod she, “that wolden two answeres conclude
In oo demande; ye axed lewedly.”°
Almache answerde unto that similitude,
“Of whennes comth thin answering so rude?”
“Of whennes?” quod she, whan that she was freined,°
“Of conscience and of good feith unfeined.”°

Almachius seide, “Takest thow non hede
Of my power?” and she answerde him this—
“Your might,” quod she, “ful litel is to drede;
For every mortal mannes power nis
But lik a bladdre,° ful of wind, ywis.°
For with a nedles point, whan it is blowe,°
May al the boost° of it be leid ful lowe.”
“Ful wrongfully bigonne thou,” quod he,
“And yet in wrong is thy perseveraunce;
Wostow nat° how our mighty princes free°
Han thus comanded and maad ordinaunce,
That every Cristen wight° shal han penaunce°
But if° that he his cristendom withseye,°
And goon al quit, if he wol it reneye?”°

“Your princes erren, as your nobley° dooth,”
Quod tho Cecile, “and with a wood sentence°
Ye make us gilty, and it is nat sooth;°
For ye, that knowen wel our innocence,
For as muche as we doon a reverence
To Crist, and for we bere a Cristen name,
Ye putte on us a crime, and eek a blame.

“But we that knowen° thilke° name so
For° vertuous, we may it nat withseye.”°
Almache answerde, “Chees oon of thise two,
Do sacrifice, or cristendom reneye,
That thou mowe now escapen by that weye.”
At which the holy blisful faire maide
Gan for to laughe, and to the juge seide,

“O juge, confus in thy nicetee,°
Woltow that I reneye innocence,
To make me a wikked wight?”° quod she;
“Lo! he dissimuleth° here in audience,
He spareth° and woodeth° in his advertence!”°
To whom Almachius, “Unsely° wrecche,
Ne woostow nat how far my might may strecche?

“Han noght our mighty princes to me yeven,°
Ye, bothe power and auctoritee
To maken folk to dyen or to liven?
Why spekestow so proudly than to me?”
“I speke noght but stedfastly,” quod she,
“Nat proudly, for I seye, as for my side,
We haten deedly thilke vice of pride.

“And if thou drede nat a sooth° to here,
Than wol I shewe al openly, by right,
That thou hast maad a ful gret lesing° here.
Thou seyst, thy princes han thee yeven might
Bothe for to sleen and for to quiken° a wight;
Thou, that ne mayst but only lif bireve,°
Thou hast non other power ne no leve!°

But thou mayst seyn,° thy princes han thee maked
Ministre of deeth; for if thou speke of mo,°
Thou lyest, for thy power is ful naked.”°
“Do wey thy boldnes,” seide Almachius tho,
“And sacrifice to our goddes, er thou go;
I recche nat° what wrong that thou me profre,
For I can suffre it as a philosophre;

“But thilke° wronges may I nat endure
That thou spekest of our goddes here,” quod he.
Cecile answerede, “O nice° creature,
Thou seidest no word sin thou spak to me
That I ne knew therwith° thy nicetee;
And that thou were, in every maner wise,
A lewed° officer, a vein justise.°

“Ther lakketh no thing to thin utter eyen°
That thou nart° blind, for thing that we seen alle
That it is stoon, that men may wel espyen,
That ilke° stoon a god thou wolt it calle.
I rede° thee, lat thin hand upon it falle,
And taste° it wel, and stoon thou shalt it finde,
Sin that thou seest nat with thin eyen blinde.

“It is a shame that the peple shal
So scorne° thee, and laughe at thy folie;
For comunly men woot° it wel overal,
That mighty God is in his hevenes hie,°
And thise images, wel thou mayst espie,°
To thee ne to hemself mowe nought profite,
For in effect they been nat worth a mite.”°

Thise wordes and swiche othere seide she,
And he weex wroth,° and bad men sholde hir lede
Hom til hir hous, “And in hir hous,” quod he,
“Brenne° hir right in a bath of flambes rede.”
And as he bad, right so was doon in dede;
For in a bath they gonne hir faste shetten,
And night and day greet fir they under betten.°

The longe night and eek a day also,
For al the fir and eek the bathes hete,
She sat al cold, and felede no wo,
It made hir nat a drope for to swete.
But in that bath hir lif she moste lete;°
For he, Almachius, with ful wikke entente
To sleen hir in the bath his sonde° sente.

Three strokes in the nekke he smoot° hir tho,°
The tormentour, but for no maner chaunce
He mighte noght smite al hir nekke atwo;
And for ther was that time an ordinaunce,
That no man sholde doon man swich penaunce°
The ferthe strook to smiten, softe or sore,
This tormentour ne dorste° do namore.

But half-deed, with hir nekke ycorven° there,
He lefte hir lie, and on his wey is went.
The Cristen folk, which that aboute hir were,
With shetes han the blood ful faire yhent.°
Thre dayes lived she in this torment,
And never cessed hem the feith to teche;
That she had fostred,° hem she gan to preche;

And hem she yaf hir moebles and hir thing,°
And to the pope Urban bitook° hem tho,
And seide, “I axed this at hevene king,
To han respit three dayes and namo,
To recomende to yow, er that I go,
Thise soules, lo! and that I might do werche°
Here of min hous perpetuelly a cherche.”

Seint Urban, with his deknes,° prively
The body fette, and buried it by nighte
Among his othere seintes honestly.°
Hir hous the chirche of Seint Cecilie highte;°
Seint Urban halwed° it, as he wel mighte;
In which, into this day, in noble wise,
Men doon to Crist and to his seint servise.
