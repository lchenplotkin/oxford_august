O blisful light, of which the bemes clere
Adorneth al the thridde hevene faire!
O sonnes leef, O Joves doughter dere,
Plesaunce of love, O goodly debonaire,
In gentil hertes ay redy to repaire!
O verray cause of hele and of gladnesse,
Yheried be thy might and thy goodnesse!
In hevene and helle, in erthe and salte see
Is felt thy might, if that I wel descerne;
As man, brid, best, fishe, herbe and grene tree
Thee fele in times with vapour eterne.
God loveth, and to love wol nought werne;
And in this world no lives creature,
Withouten love, is worth, or may endure.
Ye Joves first to thilke effectes glade,
Thorugh which that thinges liven alle and be,
Comeveden, and amorous him made
On mortal thing, and as yow list, ay ye
Yeve him in love ese or adversitee;
And in a thousand formes doun him sente
For love in erthe, and whom yow liste, he hente.
Ye fierse Mars apeisen of his ire,
And, as yow list, ye maken hertes digne.
Algates, hem that ye wol sette afire,
They dreden shame, and vices they resigne;
Ye do hem corteis be, fresshe and benigne,
And hie or lowe, after a wight entendeth;
The joyes that he hath, your might him sendeth.
Ye holden regne and hous in unitee;
Ye soothfast cause of frendship been also;
Ye knowe al thilke covered qualitee
Of thinges which that folk on wondren so,
Whan they can not construe how it may jo,
She loveth him, or why he loveth here,
As why this fish, and nought that, comth to were.
Ye folk a lawe han set in universe,
And this knowe I by hem that loveres be,
That whoso striveth with yow hath the werse:
Now, lady bright, for thy benignitee,
At reverence of hem that serven thee,
Whos clerk I am, so techeth me devise
Som joye of that is felt in thy servise.
Ye in my naked herte sentement
Inhelde, and do me shewe of thy swetnesse.—
Caliope, thy vois be now present,
For now is nede; sestow not my destresse,
How I mot telle anonright the gladnesse
Of Troilus, to Venus heryinge?
To which gladnes, who nede hath, God him bringe!
Lay al this mene while Troilus,
Recordinge his lessoun in this manere,
“Ma fey!” thought he, “Thus wole I seye and thus;
Thus wole I pleine unto my lady dere;
That word is good, and this shal be my chere;
This nil I not foryeten in no wise.”
God leve him werken as he gan devise.
And Lord, so that his herte gan to quappe,
Heringe hir come, and shorte for to sike!
And Pandarus, that ladde hir by the lappe,
Com ner, and gan in at the curtin pike,
And seide, “God do bote on alle sike!
See, who is here yow comen to visite;
Lo, here is she that is your deeth to wite.”
Therwith it semed as he wepte almost;
“A ha,” quod Troilus so rewfully,
“Wher me be wo, O mighty God, thou wost!
Who is al there? I see nought trewely.”
“Sir,” quod Criseyde, “it is Pandare and I.”
“Ye, swete herte? allas, I may nought rise
To knele, and do yow honour in som wise.”
And dressede him upward, and she right tho
Gan bothe here hondes softe upon him leye,
“O, for the love of God, do ye not so
To me,” quod she, “ey! What is this to seye?
Sir, come am I to yow for causes tweie;
First, yow to thonke, and of your lordshipe eke
Continuaunce I wolde yow biseke.”
This Troilus, that herde his lady preye
Of lordship him, wex neither quik ne deed,
Ne mighte o word for shame to it seye,
Although men sholde smiten of his heed.
But Lord, so he wex sodeinliche reed,
And sire, his lesson, that he wende conne,
To preyen hir, is thurgh his wit yronne.
Criseyde al this aspyede wel ynough,
For she was wis, and lovede him never the lasse,
Al nere he malapert, or made it tough,
Or was to bold, to singe a fool a masse.
But whan his shame gan somwhat to passe,
His resons, as I may my rimes holde,
I yow wol telle, as techen bokes olde.
In chaunged vois, right for his verrey drede,
Which vois eek quook, and therto his manere
Goodly abaist, and now his hewes rede,
Now pale, unto Criseyde, his lady dere,
With look doun cast and humble yolden chere,
Lo, the alderfirste word that him asterte
Was, twyes, “Mercy, mercy, swete herte!”
And stinte a whil, and whan he mighte out bringe,
The nexte word was, “God wot, for I have,
As feithfully as I have had konninge,
Ben youres, also God my sowle save;
And shal, til that I, woful wight, be grave.
And though I dar ne can unto yow pleine,
Ywis, I suffre nought the lasse peine.
Thus muche as now, O wommanliche wif,
I may outbringe, and if this yow displese,
That shal I wreke upon min owne lif
Right sone, I trowe, and doon your herte an ese,
If with my deeth your herte I may apese.
But sin that ye han herd me somwhat seye,
Now recche I never how sone that I deye.”
Therwith his manly sorwe to biholde,
It mighte han maad an herte of stoon to rewe;
And Pandare weep as he to watre wolde,
And poked ever his nece newe and newe,
And seide, “Wo bigon ben hertes trewe!
For love of God, make of this thing an ende,
Or slee us bothe at ones, er that ye wende.”
“I? what?” quod she, “By God and by my trouthe,
I noot nought what ye wilne that I seye.”
“I? what?” quod he, “that ye han on him routhe,
For Goddes love, and doth him nought to deie.”
“Now thanne thus,” quod she, “I wolde him preye
To telle me the fin of his entente;
Yet wiste I never wel what that he mente.”
“What that I mene, O swete herte dere?”
Quod Troilus, “O goodly fresshe free!
That, with the stremes of your eyen clere,
Ye wolde somtime freendly on me see,
And thanne agreën that I may ben he,
Withoute braunche of vice in any wise,
In trouthe alwey to doon yow my servise
As to my lady right and chief resort,
With al my wit and al my diligence,
And I to han, right as yow list, comfort,
Under your yerde, egal to min offence,
As deeth, if that I breke your defence;
And that ye deigne me so muche honoure,
Me to comaunden ought in any houre.
And I to ben your verray humble trewe,
Secret, and in my paines pacient,
And evermo desire freshly newe,
To serve, and been ylike ay diligent,
And, with good herte, al holly your talent
Receiven wel, how sore that me smerte,
Lo, this mene I, min owene swete herte.”
Quod Pandarus, “Lo, here an hard request,
And resonable, a lady for to werne!
Now, nece min, by natal Joves fest,
Were I a god, ye sholde sterve as yerne,
That heren wel, this man wol nothing yerne
But your honour, and seen him almost sterve,
And been so looth to suffren him yow serve.”
With that she gan hir eyen on him caste
Ful esily, and ful debonairly,
Avising hir, and hyed not to faste
With never a word, but seide him softely,
“Min honour sauf, I wol wel trewely,
And in swich forme as he can now devise,
Receiven him fully to my servise,
“Biseching him, for Goddes love, that he
Wolde, in honour of trouthe and gentilesse,
As I wel mene, eek mene wel to me,
And min honour, with wit and besinesse,
Ay kepe; and if I may don him gladnesse,
From hennesforth, ywis, I nil not feine:
Now beeth al hool, no lenger ye ne pleine.
“But nathelees, this warne I yow,” quod she,
“A kinges sone although ye be, ywis,
Ye shul namore han soverainetee
Of me in love, than right in that cas is;
Ny nil forbere, if that ye doon amis,
To wrathen yow; and whil that ye me serve,
Chericen yow right after ye deserve.
“And shortly, derë herte and al my knight,
Beth glad, and draweth yow to lustinesse,
And I shal trewely, with al my might,
Your bittre tornen al into swetnesse;
If I be she that may yow do gladnesse,
For every wo ye shal recovere a blisse”;
And him in armes took, and gan him kisse.
Fil Pandarus on knees, and up his yën
To heven threw, and held his hondes hie,
“Immortal god!” quod he, “that mayst nought dyen,
Cupide I mene, of this mayst glorifie;
And Venus, thou mayst make melodie;
Withouten hond, me semeth that in towne,
For this merveile, I here ech belle sowne.
“But ho! no more as now of this matere,
Forwhy this folk wol comen up anoon,
That han the lettre red; lo, I hem here.
But I conjure thee, Criseyde, and oon,
And two, thou Troilus, whan thou mayst goon,
That at min hous ye been at my warninge,
For I ful wel shal shape your cominge;
“And eseth ther youre hertes right ynough;
And lat see which of yow shal bere the belle
To speke of love aright!” therwith he lough,
“For ther have ye a laiser for to telle.”
Quod Troilus, “How longe shal I dwelle
Er this be doon?” Quod he, “Whan thou mayst rise,
This thing shal be right as I yow devise.”
With that Eleine and also Deiphebus
Tho comen upward, right at the steires ende;
And Lord, so than gan gronen Troilus,
His brother and his suster for to blende.
Quod Pandarus, “It time is that we wende;
Tak, nece min, your leve at alle three,
And lat hem speke, and cometh forth with me.”
She took hir leve at hem ful thriftily,
As she wel coude, and they hir reverence
Unto the fulle diden hardely,
And speken wonder wel, in hir absence,
Of hir, in preising of hir excellence,
Hir governaunce, hir wit; and hir manere
Commendeden, it joye was to here.
Now lat hir wende unto hir owne place,
And torne we to Troilus ayein,
That gan ful lightly of the lettre pace,
That Deiphebus hadde in the gardin seyn.
And of Eleine and him he wolde fain
Delivered been, and seide, that him leste
To slepe, and after tales have reste.
Eleine him kiste, and took hir leve blive,
Deiphebus eek, and hoom wente every wight;
And Pandarus, as faste as he may drive,
To Troilus tho com, as line right;
And on a paillet, al that glade night,
By Troilus he lay, with mery chere,
To tale; and wel was hem they were yfere.
Whan every wight was voided but they two,
And al the dores were faste yshette,
To telle in short, withoute wordes mo,
This Pandarus, withouten any lette,
Up roos, and on his beddes side him sette,
And gan to speken in a sobre wise
To Troilus, as I shal yow devise.
“Min alderlevest Lord, and brother dere,
God woot, and thou, that it sat me so sore,
When I thee saw so languisshing to yere,
For love, of which thy wo wex alwey more;
That I, with al my might and al my lore,
Have evere sithen doon my bisinesse
To bringe thee to joye out of distresse;
“And have it brought to swich plit as thou wost,
So that, thorugh me, thow stondest now in weye
To fare wel, I seye it for no bost,
And wostow why? for shame it is to seye,
For thee have I bigonne a gamen pleye
Which that I nevere doon shal eft for other,
Although he were a thousand fold my brother.
“That is to seye, for thee am I bicomen,
Bitwixen game and ernest, swich a mene
As maken wommen unto men to comen;
Al sey I nought, thou wost wel what I mene.
For thee have I my nece, of vices clene,
So fully maad thy gentilesse triste,
That al shal been right as thyselve liste.
“But God, that al wot, take I to witnesse,
That never I this for coveitise wroughte,
But only for to abregge that distresse,
For which wel nigh thou deidest, as me thoughte.
But gode brother, do now as thee oughte,
For Goddes love, and keep hir out of blame,
Sin thou art wis, and save alwey hir name.
“For wel thou wost, the name as yet of here
Among the peple, as who seith, halwed is;
For that man is unbore, I dar wel swere,
That ever wiste that she dide amis.
But wo is me, that I, that cause al this,
May thenken that she is my nece dere,
And I hir eem, and traitor eek yfere!
“And were it wist that I, through min engin,
Hadde in my nece yput this fantasie,
To do thy lust, and hoolly to be thin,
Why, al the world upon it wolde crie,
And seyn, that I the worste trecherie
Dide in this cas, that ever was bigonne,
And she forlost, and thou right nought ywonne.
“Wherfore, er I wol ferther goon a pas,
Yet eft I thee biseche and fully seye,
That privetee go with us in this cas,
That is to seye, that thou us never wreie;
And be nought wrooth, though I thee ofte preye
To holden secree swich an heigh matere;
For skilful is, thow wost wel, my preiere.
“And thenk what wo ther hath bitid er this,
For makinge of avauntes, as men rede;
And what mischaunce in this world yet ther is,
Fro day to day, right for that wikked dede;
For which these wise clerkes that ben dede
Han ever yet proverbed to us yonge,
That ‘firste vertu is to kepe tonge.’
“And, nere it that I wilne as now t’abregge
Diffusioun of speche, I coude almost
A thousand olde stories thee alegge
Of wommen lost, thorugh fals and foles bost;
Proverbes canst thyself ynowe, and wost,
Ayeins that vice, for to been a labbe,
Al seid men sooth as often as they gabbe.
“O tonge, allas! so often herebiforn
Hastow made many a lady bright of hewe
Seid, ‘Welawey! the day that I was born!’
And many a maides sorwes for to newe;
And, for the more part, al is untrewe
That men of yelpe, and it were brought to preve;
Of kinde non avauntour is to leve.
“Avauntour and a lyere, al is on;
As thus: I pose, a womman graunte me
Hir love, and seith that other wol she non,
And I am sworn to holden it secree,
And after I go telle it two or three;
Ywis, I am avauntour at the leste,
And lyere, for I breke my biheste.
“Now loke thanne, if they be nought to blame,
Swich maner folk; what shal I clepe hem, what,
That hem avaunte of wommen, and by name,
That nevere yet bihighte hem this ne that,
Ne knowe hem more than min olde hat?
No wonder is, so God me sende hele,
Though wommen drede with us men to dele.
“I sey not this for no mistrust of yow,
Ne for no wis man, but for foles nice,
And for the harm that in the world is now,
As wel for foly ofte as for malice;
For wel wot I, in wise folk, that vice
No womman drat, if she be wel avised;
For wise ben by foles harm chastised.
“But now to purpos; leve brother dere,
Have al this thing that I have seid in minde,
And keep thee clos, and be now of good chere,
For at thy day thou shalt me trewe finde.
I shal thy proces sette in swich a kinde,
And God toforn, that it shall thee suffise,
For it shal been right as thou wolt devise.
“For wel I woot, thou menest wel, parde;
Therfore I dar this fully undertake.
Thou wost eek what thy lady graunted thee,
And day is set, the chartres up to make.
Have now good night, I may no lenger wake;
And bid for me, sin thou art now in blisse,
That God me sende deeth or sone lisse.”
Who mighte telle half the joye or feste
Which that the sowle of Troilus tho felte,
Hering th’effect of Pandarus biheste?
His olde wo, that made his herte swelte,
Gan tho for joye wasten and tomelte,
And al the richesse of his sikes sore
At ones fledde, he felte of hem no more.
But right so as these holtes and these hayes,
That han in winter dede been and dreie,
Revesten hem in grene, whan that May is,
Whan every lusty liketh best to pleye:
Right in that selve wise, sooth to seye,
Wex sodeinliche his herte ful of joye,
That gladder was ther never man in Troye.
And gan his look on Pandarus up caste
Ful sobrely, and frendly for to see,
And seide, “Freend, in Aperil the laste,
As wel thou wost, if it remembre thee,
How neigh the deeth for wo thou founde me;
And how thou didest al thy bisinesse
To knowe of me the cause of my distresse.
“Thou wost how longe I it forbar to seye
To thee, that art the man that I best triste;
And peril was it noon to thee biwreie,
That wiste I wel; but tel me, if thee liste,
Sith I so looth was that thyself it wiste,
How dorste I mo tellen of this matere,
That quake now, and no wight may us here?
“But natheles, by that God I thee swere,
That, as him list, may al this world governe,
And, if I lie, Achilles with his spere
Min herte cleve, al were my lif eterne,
As I am mortal, if I late or yerne
Wolde it biwreie, or dorste, or sholde conne,
For al the good that God made under sonne;
“That rather deie I wolde, and determine,
As thinketh me, now stokked in presoun,
In wrecchednesse, in filthe, and in vermine,
Caitif to cruel king Agamenoun;
And this, in alle the temples of this toun,
Upon the goddes alle, I wol thee swere,
Tomorwe day, if that thee liketh here.
“And that thou hast so muche ydoon for me,
That I ne may it never more deserve,
This knowe I wel, al mighte I now for thee
A thousand times on a morwen sterve,
I can no more, but that I wol thee serve
Right as thy sclave, whiderso thou wende,
For evermore, unto my lives ende!
“But here, with al min herte, I thee biseche,
That never in me thou deme swich folie
As I shal seyn; me thoughte, by thy speche,
That this, which thou me dost for companie,
I sholde wene it were a bauderie;
I am nought wood, al if I lewed be;
It is not so, that woot I wel, pardee.
“But he that goth, for gold or for richesse,
On swich message, calle him what thee list
And this that thou dost, calle it gentilesse,
Compassioun, and felawship, and trist;
Departe it so, for widewhere is wist
How that there is diversitee requered
Bitwixen thinges like, as I have lered.
“And, that thou knowe I thenke nought ne wene
That this servise a shame be or jape,
I have my faire suster Polixene,
Cassandre, Eleine, or any of the frape;
Be she never so faire or wel yshape,
Tel me, which thou wilt of everichone,
To han for thin, and lat me thanne allone.
“But sin that thou hast don me this servise,
My lif to save, and for noon hope of mede,
So, for the love of God, this grete emprise
Parforme it out; for now is moste nede.
For high and low, withouten any drede,
I wol alwey thine hestes alle kepe;
Have now good night, and lat us bothe slepe.”
Thus held him ech of other wel apaied,
That al the world ne mighte it bet amende;
And, on the morwe, whan they were araied,
Ech to his owene nedes gan entende.
But Troilus, though as the fir he brende
For sharp desir of hope and of plesaunce,
He not forgat his wise governaunce.
But in himself with manhod gan restreine
Ech rakel dede and ech unbridled chere,
That alle tho that liven, sooth to seyne,
Ne sholde han wist, by word or by manere,
What that he mente, as touching this matere.
From every wight as fer as is the cloude
He was, so wel dissimulen he coude.
And al the whil which that I yow devise,
This was his lif; with al his fulle might,
By day he was in Martes high servise,
This is to seyn, in armes as a knight;
And for the more part, the longe night
He lay, and thoughte how that he mighte serve
His lady best, hir thank for to deserve.
Nil I nought swerë, although he lay softe,
That in his thought he nas sumwhat disesed,
Ne that he tornede on his pilwes ofte,
And wolde of that him missed han ben sesed;
But in swich cas man is nought alwey plesed,
For ought I wot, no more than was he;
That can I deme of possibilitee.
But certein is, to purpos for to go,
That in this while, as writen is in geste,
He say his lady somtime; and also
She with him spak, whan that she dorste or leste,
And by hir bothe avis, as was the beste,
Apointeden ful warly in this nede,
So as they dorste, how they wold procede.
But it was spoken in so short a wise,
In swich await alwey, and in swich fere
Lest any wight divinen or devise
Wolde of hem two, or to it leye an ere,
That al this world so leef to hem ne were
As that Cupido wolde hem grace sende
To maken of hir speche aright an ende.
But thilke litel that they spake or wroughte,
His wise goost took ay of al swich hede,
It semed hir, he wiste what she thoughte
Withouten word, so that it was no nede
To bidde him ought to done, or ought forbede;
For which hir thought that love, al come it late,
Of alle joye hadde opned hir the yate.
And shortly of this proces for to pace,
So wel his werk and wordes he bisette,
That he so ful stood in his lady grace,
That twenty thousand times, or she lette,
She thonked God she ever with him mette;
So coude he him governe in swich servise,
That al the world ne mighte it bet devise.
Forwhy she fond him so discreet in al,
So secret, and of swich obeisaunce,
That wel she felte he was to hir a wal
Of steel, and sheld from every displesaunce;
That, to ben in his gode governaunce,
So wis he was, she was no more afered,
I mene, as fer as oughte ben requered.
And Pandarus, to quike alwey the fir,
Was ever ylike prest and diligent;
To ese his frend was set al his desir.
He shof ay on, he to and fro was sent;
He lettres bar whan Troilus was absent.
That never man, as in his freendes nede,
Ne bar him bet than he, withouten drede.
But now, paraunter, som man waiten wolde
That every word, or sonde, or look, or chere
Of Troilus that I rehersen sholde,
In al this while, unto his lady dere;
I trowe it were a long thing for to here;
Or of what wight that stant in swich disjointe,
His wordes alle, or every look, to pointe.
For sothe, I have not herd it doon er this,
In storie noon, ne no man here, I wene;
And though I wolde I coude not, ywis;
For ther was som epistel hem bitwene,
That wolde, as seith min auctor, wel contene
Neigh half this book, of which him list notwrite;
How sholde I thanne a line of it endite?
But to the grete effect: than sey I thus,
That stonding in concord and in quiete
Thise ilke two, Criseyde and Troilus,
As I have told, and in this time swete,
Save only often mighte they not mete,
Ne laiser have hir speches to fulfelle,
That it befel right as I shal yow telle,
That Pandarus, that ever dide his might
Right for the fin that I shal speke of here,
As for to bringe to his hous som night
His faire nece, and Troilus yfere,
Wheras at leiser al this heigh matere,
Touching hir love, were at the fulle upbounde,
Hadde out of doute a time to it founde.
For he with greet deliberacioun
Hadde every thing that herto mighte availe
Forncast, and put in execucioun,
And neither laft, for cost ne for travaile;
Come if hem lest, hem sholde no thing faile;
And for to been in ought espyed there,
That, wiste he wel, an inpossible were.
Dredelees, it cleer was in the wind
Of every pie and every lette-game;
Now al is wel, for al the world is blind
In this matere, bothe fremed and tame.
This timber is al redy up to frame;
Us lakketh nought but that we witen wolde
A certein houre, in which she comen sholde.
And Troilus, that al this purveiaunce,
Knew at the fulle, and waitede on it ay,
Hadde hereupon eek made gret ordenaunce,
And founde his cause, and therto his aray,
If that he were missed, night or day,
Therwhile he was aboute this servise,
That he was goon to doon his sacrifise
And moste at swich a temple alone wake,
Answered of Appollo for to be;
And first, to seen the holy laurer quake,
Er that Apollo spak out of the tree,
To telle him next whan Grekes sholden flee,
And forthy lette him no man, God forbede,
But preye Apollo helpen in this nede.
Now is ther litel more for to done,
But Pandare up, and shortly for to seyne,
Right sone upon the chaunging of the mone,
Whan lightles is the world a night or tweine,
And that the welken shoop him for to reine,
He streight amorwe unto his nece wente;
Ye han wel herd the fin of his entente.
Whan he was come, he gan anoon to pleye
As he was wont, and at himself to jape;
And finally, he swor and gan hir seye,
By this and that, she sholde him not escape,
Ne lenger doon him after hir to cape;
But certeinly she moste, by hir leve
Come soupen in his hous with him at eve.
At which she lough, and gan hir fasteexcuse,
And seide, “It raineth; lo, how sholde I goon?”
“Lat be,” quod he, “ne stond not thus to muse;
This moot be doon, ye shal be ther anoon.”
So at the laste herof they felle at oon,
Or elles, softe he swor hir in hir ere,
He nolde never come ther she were.
Soone after this she to him gan to rowne,
And asked him if Troilus were there?
He swor hir, “Nay, for he was out of towne,”
And seide, “Nece, I pose that he were,
Yow thurfte never have the more fere.
For rather than men mighte him ther aspie,
Me were lever a thousandfold to die.”
Nought list min auctor fully to declare
What that she thoughte whan he seide so,
That Troilus was out of town yfare,
As if he seide therof sooth or no;
But that, withoute await, with him to go,
She graunted him, sith he hir that bisoughte,
And, as his nece, obeyed as hir oughte.
But nathelees, yet gan she him biseche,
Although with him to goon it was no fere,
For to be war of goosish peples speche,
That dremen thinges which that never were,
And wel avise him whom he broughte there;
And seide him, “Em, sin I mot on yow triste,
Loke al be wel, for I do that yow liste.”
He swor hir, “Yis, by stokkes and by stones,
And by the goddes that in heven dwelle,
Or elles were him lever, soule and bones,
With Pluto king as depe been in helle
As Tantalus!” What sholde I more telle?
Whan al was wel, he roos and took his leve,
And she to souper com, whan it was eve,
With a certain of hir owne men,
And with hir faire nece Antigone,
And othere of hir wommen nine or ten;
But who was glad now, who, as trowe ye,
But Troilus, that stood and mighte it see
Thurghout a litel windowe in a stewe,
Ther he bishet, sin midnight, was in mewe,
Unwist of every wight but of Pandare?
But to the point; now whan she was ycome
With alle joye, and alle frendes fare,
Hir em anoon in armes hath hir nome,
And after to the souper, alle and some,
Whan time was, ful softe they hem sette;
God wot, ther was no deintee for to fette.
And after souper gonnen they to rise,
At ese wel, with hertes fresshe and glade,
And wel was him that coude best devise
To liken hir, or that hir laughen made.
He song; she pleide; he tolde a tale of Wade.
But at the laste, as every thing hath ende,
She took hir leve, and nedes wolde wende.
But O, Fortune, executrice of wierdes,
O influences of thise hevenes hie!
Soth is, that, under God, ye ben our hierdes,
Though to us bestes been the causes wrie.
This mene I now, for she gan hoomward hie,
But execut was al biside hir leve
The goddes wil; for which she moste bleve.
The bente mone with hir hornes pale,
Saturne and Jove in Cancro joined were,
That swich a rain from heven gan avale,
That every maner womman that was there
Hadde of that smoky rein a verray fere;
At which Pandare tho lough, and seide thenne,
“Now were it time a lady to go henne!
“But goode nece, if I mighte ever plese
Yow any thing, than prey I yow,” quod he,
“To doon min herte as now so greet an ese
As for to dwelle here al this night with me,
Forwhy this is your owen hous, pardee.
For, by my trouthe, I sey it nought agame,
To wende as now, it were to me a shame.”
Criseyde, whiche that coude as muche good
As half a world, tok hede of his preiere;
And sin it ron, and al was on a flood,
She thoughte, “As good chep may I dwellen here,
And graunte it gladly with a freendes chere,
And have a thank, as grucche and thanne abide;
For hoom to goon it may nought wel bitide.”
“I wol,” quod she, “min uncle leef and dere,
Sin that yow list, it skile is to be so;
I am right glad with yow to dwellen here;
I seide but agame, I wolde go.”
“Ywis, graunt mercy, nece!” quod he tho;
“Were it a game or no, soth for to telle,
Now am I glad, sin that yow list to dwelle.”
Thus al is wel; but tho bigan aright
The newe daunce, and al the feste again;
But Pandarus, if goodly hadde he might,
He wolde han hyed hir to bedde fain,
And seide, “Lord, this is an huge rain!
This were a weder for to slepen inne;
And that I rede us sone to biginne.
“And nece, woot ye wher I wol yow leye,
For that we shul not liggen fer asonder,
And for ye neither shullen, dar I seye,
Heren noise of reines nor of thondre?
By God, right in my lite closet yonder.
And I wol in that outer hous allone
Be wardein of yow wommen everichone.
“And in this middel chaumbre that ye see
Shul youre wommen slepen wel and softe;
And there besidin shal yourselve be;
And if ye liggen wel tonight, com ofte,
And careth not what weder is onlofte.
The win anon, and whan so that yow leste,
So go we slepe, I trowe it be the beste.”
Ther nis no more, but hereafter sone,
The voidè dronke, and travers drawe anon,
Gan every wight, that hadde nought to done
More in that place, out of the chaumber gon.
And evermo so sternelich it ron,
And blew therwith so wonderliche loude,
That wel neigh no man heren other coude.
Tho Pandarus, hir em, right as him oughte,
With women swiche as were hir most aboute,
Ful glad unto hir beddes side hir broughte,
And toke his leve, and gan ful lowe loute,
And seid, “Here at this closet dore withoute,
Right overthwart, your wommen liggen alle,
That, whom yow liste of hem, ye may here calle.”
So whan that she was in the closet leid,
And alle hir wommen forth by ordenaunce
Abedde weren, ther as I have seid,
There was no more to skippen nor to traunce,
But boden go to bedde, with mischaunce,
If any wight was steringe anywhere,
And late hem slepe that abedde were.
But Pandarus, that wel coude eche a del
The olde daunce, and every point therinne,
Whan that he sey that alle thing was wel,
He thoughte he wolde upon his werk biginne,
And gan the stewe dore al softe unpinne,
And stille as stoon, withouten lenger lette,
By Troilus adoun right he him sette.
And, shortly to the point right for to gon,
Of al this werk he tolde him word and ende,
And seide, “Make thee redy right anon,
For thou shalt into heven blisse wende.”
“Now blisful Venus, thou me grace sende,”
Quod Troilus, “for never yet no nede
Hadde I er now, ne halvendel the drede.”
Quod Pandarus, “Ne drede thee never a del,
For it shal ben right as thou wilt desire;
So thrive I, this night shal I make it wel,
Or casten al the gruwel in the fire.”
“Yit blisful Venus, this night thou me enspire,”
Quod Troilus, “as wis as I thee serve,
And ever bet and bet shal, til I sterve.
“And if I hadde, O Venus ful of mirthe,
Aspectes badde of Mars or of Saturne,
Or thou combust or let were in my birthe,
Thy fader prey al thilke harm disturne
Of grace, and that I glad ayein may turne,
For love of him thou lovedest in the shawe,
I mene Adoon, that with the boor was slawe.
“O jove eek, for the love of faire Europe,
The whiche in forme of bole away thou fette;
Now help, O Mars, thou with thy blody cope,
For love of Cipris, thou me nought ne lette;
O Phebus, thenk whan Dane hirselven shette
Under the bark, and laurer wex for drede,
Yet for hir love, O help now at this nede!
“Mercurie, for the love of Hierse eke,
For which Pallas was with Aglauros wrooth,
Now help, and eek Diane, I thee biseke,
That this viage be not to thee looth.
O fatal sustren, which, er any clooth
Me shapen was, my destenè me sponne,
So helpeth to this werk that is bigonne!”
Quod Pandarus, “Thou wrecched mouses herte,
Art thou agast so that she wol thee bite?
Why, don this furred cloke upon thy sherte
And folowe me, for I wol han the wite;
But bid, and lat me go bifore a lite.”
And with that word he gan undo a trappe,
And Troilus he broughte in by the lappe.
The sterne wind so loude gan to route
That no wight other noise mighte here;
And they that layen at the dore withoute,
Ful sikerly they slepten alle yfere;
And Pandarus, with a ful sobre chere,
Goth to the dore anon withouten lette,
Theras they laye, and softely it shette.
And as he has come ayeinward prively,
His nece awook, and asked “Who goth there?”
“My dere nece,” quod he, “it am I;
Ne wondreth not, ne have of it no fere”;
And ner he com, and seide hir in hir ere,
“No word, for love of God I yow biseche;
Lat no wight rise and heren of our speche.”
“What! which wey be ye comen, benedicite?”
Quod she, “And how thus unwist of hem alle?”
“Here at this secre trappe dore,” quod he.
Quod tho Criseyde, “Lat me som wight calle.”
“Ey! God forbede that it sholde falle,”
Quod Pandarus, “That ye swich foly wroughte!
They mighte deme thing they nevere er thoughte!
“It is nought good a sleping hound to wake,
Ne yeve a wight a cause to devine;
Your wommen slepen alle, I undertake,
So that, for hem, the hous men mighte mine;
And slepen wolen til the sonne shine.
And whan my tale ybrought is to an ende,
Unwist, right as I com, so wol I wende.
“Now nece min, ye shul wel understonde,”
Quod he, “so as ye wommen demen alle,
That for to holde in love a man in honde,
And him hir ‘leef ’ and ‘dere herte’ calle,
And maken him an howve above a calle,
I mene, as love an other in this while,
She doth hirself a shame, and him a gile.
“Now wherby that I telle yow al this?
Ye woot yourself, as wel as any wight,
How that your love al fully graunted is
To Troilus, the worthieste knight,
Oon of this world, and therto trouthe plight,
That, but it were on him along, ye nolde
Him never falsen, whil ye liven sholde.
“Now stant it thus, that sith I fro yow wente,
This Troilus, right platly for to seyn,
Is thurgh a goter, by a privé wente,
Into my chaumbre come in al this rein,
Unwist of every maner wight, certein,
Save of myself, as wisly have I joye,
And by that feith I shal Priam of Troye!
“And he is come in swich peine and distresse
That, but he be al fully wood by this,
He sodeinly mot falle into wodnesse,
But if God helpe; and cause why this is:
He seith him told is, of a freend of his,
How that ye sholde love oon hatte Horaste,
For sorwe of which this night shalt been his laste.”
Criseyde, which that al this wonder herde,
Gan sodeinly aboute hir herte colde,
And with a sik she sorwfully answerde,
“Allas! I wende, whoso tales tolde,
My dere herte wolde me not holde
So lightly fals! allas! conceites wronge,
What harm they doon, for now live I to longe!
“Horaste! allas! and falsen Troilus?
I knowe him not, God help me so,” quod she;
“Allas! what wikked spirit tolde him thus?
Now certes, em, tomorwe, and I him see,
I shal therof as ful excusen me
As ever dide womman, if him like”;
And with that word she gan ful sore sike.
“O God!” quod she, “so worldly selinesse,
Which clerkes callen fals felicitee,
Ymedled is with many a bitternesse!
Ful anguisshous than is, God woot,” quod she,
“Condicioun of vein prosperitee;
For either joyes comen nought yfere,
Or elles no wight hath hem alwey here.
“O brotel wele of mannes joye unstable!
With what wight so thou be, or how thou pleye,
Either he woot that thou, joye, art muable,
Or woot it not, it moot ben oon of tweie;
Now if he woot it not, how may he seye
That he hath verray joye and selinesse,
That is of ignoraunce ay in derknesse?
“Now if he woot that joye is transitorie,
As every joye of worldly thing mot flee,
Than every time he that hath in memorie,
The drede of lesing maketh him that he
May in no parfit selinesse be.
And if to lese his joye he set a mite,
Than semeth it that joye is worth ful lite.
“Wherfore I wol deffine in this matere,
That trewely, for ought I can espie,
Ther is no verray wele in this world here.
But O, thou wikked serpent Jalousie,
Thou misbeleved and envious folie,
Why hastow Troilus me mad untriste,
That never yet agilte him, that I wiste?”
Quod Pandarus, “Thus fallen is this cas.”
“Why, uncle min,” quod she, “who tolde him this?
Why doth my dere herte thus, allas?”
“Ye woot, ye nece min,” quod he, “what is;
I hope al shal be wel that is amis.
For ye may quenche al this, if that yow leste,
And doth right so, for I holde it the beste.”
“So shal I do tomorwe, ywis,” quod she,
“And God toforn, so that it shal suffise.”
“To-morwe? allas, that were a fair,” quod he,
“Nay, nay, it may not stonden in this wise;
For, nece min, thus writen clerkes wise,
That peril is with drecching in ydrawe;
Nay, swich abodes been nought worth an hawe.
“Nece, alle thing hath time, I dar avowe;
For whan a chaumbre afir is, or an halle,
Wel more nede is, it sodeinly rescowe
Than to dispute, and axe amonges alle
How is this candele in the straw yfalle?
A! benedicite! for al among that fare
The harm is doon, and farewel feldefare!
“And, nece min, ne take it not agreef,
If that ye suffre him al night in this wo,
God help me so, ye hadde him never leef,
That dar I seyn, now there is but we two;
But wel I woot, that ye wol not do so;
Ye been to wis to do so gret folie,
To putte his lif al night in jupartie.”
“Hadde I him never leef? By God, I wene
Ne hadde I never thing so leef,” quod she.
“Now by my thrift,” quod he, “that shal be sene;
For, sin ye make this ensample of me,
If I al night wolde him in sorwe see
For al the tresour in the toun of Troye,
I bidde God, I nevere mote have joye!
Now loke thanne, if ye, that been his love,
Shul putte al night his lif in jupartie
For thing of nought! Now, by that God above,
Nought only this delay comth of folie,
But of malice, if that I shal nought lie.
What, platly, and ye suffre him in distresse,
Ye neither bountee doon ne gentilesse!”
Quod tho Criseyde, “Wole ye doon o thing,
And ye therwith shal stinte al his disese;
Have here, and bereth him this blewe ringe,
For ther is nothing mighte him bettre plese,
Save I myself, ne more his herte apese;
And sey my dere herte, that his sorwe
Is causeles, that shal be seen tomorwe.”
“A ring?” quod he, “ye, hasel—wodes shaken!
Ye, nece min, that ring moste han a stoon
That mighte dede men alive maken;
And swich a ring, trowe I that ye have noon.
Discrecioun out of your heed is goon;
That fele I now,” quod he, “and that is routhe;
O time ylost, wel maystow cursen slouthe!
“Wot ye not wel that noble and heigh corage
Ne sorweth not, ne stinteth eek for lite?
But if a fool were in a jalous rage,
I nolde setten at his sorwe a mite,
But feffe him with a fewe wordes white
Another day, whan that I mighte him finde.
But this thing stont al in another kinde.
“This is so gentil and so tendre of herte,
That with his deeth he wol his sorwes wreke;
For trusteth wel, how sore that him smerte,
He wol to yow no jalous wordes speke.
And forthy, nece, er that his herte breke,
So spek yourself to him of this matere;
For with o word ye may his herte stere.
“Now have I told what peril he is inne,
And his coming unwist of every wight;
Ne, pardee, harm may ther be noon ne sinne;
I wol myself be with yow al this night.
Ye knowe eek how it is your owne knight,
And that, by right, ye moste upon him triste,
And I al prest to fecche him whan yow liste.”
This accident so pitous was to here,
And eek so lik a sooth, at prime face,
And Troilus hir knight to hir so dere,
His privé coming, and the siker place,
That, though that she dide him as thanne a grace,
Considered alle thinges as they stode,
No wonder is, sin she dide al for gode.
Criseyde answerde, “As wisly God at reste
My sowle bringe, as me is for him wo!
And em, ywis, fain wolde I doon the beste,
If that I hadde a grace to do so.
But whether that ye dwelle or for him go,
I am, til God me bettre minde sende,
At dulcarnon, right at my wittes ende.”
Quod Pandarus, “Ye, nece, wol ye here?
Dulcarnon called is ‘fleminge of wrecches’;
It semeth hard, for wrecches wol not lere
For verray slouthe or othere wilful tecches;
This seid by hem that be not worth two fecches.
But ye ben wis, and that we han on honde
Nis neither hard, ne skilful to withstonde.”
“Thanne, em,” quod she, “doth herof as yow list;
But er he come I wil up first arise;
And, for the love of God, sin al my trist
Is on yow two, and ye ben bothe wise,
So wircheth now in so discreet a wise,
That I honour may have, and he plesaunce;
For I am here al in your governaunce.”
“That is wel seid,” quod he, “my nece dere,
Ther good thrift on that wise gentil herte!
But liggeth stille, and taketh him right here,
It nedeth not no ferther for him sterte;
And ech of yow ese otheres sorwes smerte,
For love of God; and, Venus, I thee herie;
For sone hope I we shulle ben alle merie.”
This Troilus ful sone on knees him sette
Ful sobrely, right by hir beddes heed,
And in his beste wise his lady grette;
But Lord, so she wex sodeinliche reed!
Ne, though men sholden smiten of hir heed,
She coude nought a word aright out bringe
So sodeinly, for his sodein cominge.
But Pandarus, that so wel coude fele
In every thing, to pleye anoon bigan,
And seide, “Nece, see how this lord can knele!
Now, for your trouthe, seeth this gentil man!”
And with that word he for a quisshen ran,
And seide, “Kneleth now, whil that yow leste,
Ther God your hertes bringe sone at reste!”
Can I not seyn, for she bad him not rise,
If sorwe it putte out of hir remembraunce,
Or elles if she toke it in the wise
Of duëtee, as for his observaunce;
But wel finde I she dide him this plesaunce,
That she him kiste, although she siked sore;
And bad him sitte adoun withouten more.
Quod Pandarus, “Now wol ye wel biginne;
Now doth him sitte, gode nece dere,
Upon your beddes side al there withinne,
That ech of yow the bet may other here.”
And with that word he drow him to the fere,
And took a light, and fond his contenaunce
As for to loke upon an old romaunce.
Criseyde, that was Troilus lady right,
And cleer stood on a ground of sikernesse,
Al thoughte she, hir servaunt and hir knight
Ne sholde of right non untrouthe in hir gesse,
Yet nathelees, considered his distresse,
And that love is in cause of swich folie,
Thus to him spak she of his jelousie:
“Lo, herte min, as wold the excellence
Of love, ayeins the which that no man may,
Ne oughte eek goodly maken resistence
And eek bicause I felte wel and say
Your grete trouthe, and servise every day,
And that your herte al min was, sooth to seyne,
This droof me for to rewe upon your peine.
“And your goodnesse have I founde alwey yit,
Of whiche, my dere herte and al my knight,
I thonke it yow, as fer as I have wit,
Al can I nought as muche as it were right;
And I, emforth my conninge and my might,
Have and ay shal, how sore that me smerte,
Ben to yow trewe and hool, with al min herte;
“And dredelees, that shal be founde at preve.—
But, herte min, what al this is to seyne
Shal wel be told, so that ye noght yow greve,
Though I to yow right on yourself compleine.
For therwith mene I finally the peine,
That halt your herte and min in hevinesse,
Fully to sleen, and every wrong redresse.
“My goode min, not I forwhy ne how
That jalousie, allas! that wikked wivere,
Thus causelees is cropen into yow;
The harm of which I wolde fain delivere!
Allas! that he, al hool, or of him slivere,
Shuld have his refut in so digne a place,
Ther Jove him sone out of your herte arace!
“But O, thou Jove, O auctor of nature,
Is this an honour to thy deitee,
That folk ungiltif suffren here injure,
And who that giltif is, al quit goth he?
O were it leful for to pleine on thee,
That undeserved suffrest jalousie,
And that I wolde upon thee pleine and crie!
“Eek al my wo is this, that folk now usen
To seyn right thus, ‘Ye, jalousie is love!’
And wolde a busshel venim al excusen,
For that o grein of love is on it shove!
But that wot heighe God that sit above,
If it be liker love, or hate, or grame;
And after that, it oughte bere his name.
“But certein is, som maner jalousie
Is excusable more than som, ywis.
As whan cause is, and som swich fantasie
With pietee so wel repressed is,
That it unnethe dooth or seith amis,
But goodly drinketh up al his distresse;
And that excuse I, for the gentilesse.
“And som so ful of furie is and despit,
That it sourmounteth his repressioun;
But herte min, ye be not in that plit,
That thanke I God, for which your passioun
I wol not calle it but illusioun,
Of habundaunce of love and bisy cure,
That dooth your herte this disese endure.
“Of which I am right sory, but not wrooth;
But, for my devoir and your hertes reste,
Wherso yow list, by ordal or by ooth,
By sort, or in what wise so yow leste,
For love of God, lat preve it for the beste!
And if that I be giltif, do me deie,
Allas! what mighte I more doon or seye?”
With that a fewe brighte teres newe
Out of hir eyen fille, and thus she seide,
“Now God, thou wost, in thought ne dede untrewe
To Troilus was never yet Criseyde.”
With that hir heed doun in the bed she leide,
And with the shete it wreigh, and sighed sore,
And held hir pees; not o word spak she more.
But now help God to quenchen al this sorwe,
So hope I that he shal, for he best may;
For I have seyn, of a ful misty morwe
Folwen ful ofte a mery someres day;
And after winter folweth grene May.
Men seen alday, and reden eek in stories,
That after sharpe shoures been victories.
This Troilus, whan he hir wordes herde,
Have ye no care, him liste not to slepe;
For it thoughte him no strokes of a yerde
To here or seen Criseyde his lady wepe;
But wel he felte aboute his herte crepe,
For every teer which that Criseyde asterte,
The crampe of deeth, to streine him by the herte.
And in his minde he gan the time acurse
That he cam there, and that that he was born;
For now is wikke yturned into worse,
And al that labour he hath doon biforn,
He wende it lost, he thoughte he nas but lorn.
“O Pandarus,” thoughte he, “allas! thy wile
Serveth of nought, so weilawey the while!”
And therwithal he heng adoun the heed,
And fil on knees, and sorwfully he sighte;
What mighte he seyn? he felte he nas but deed,
For wrooth was she that shulde his sorwes lighte.
But nathelees, whan that he speken mighte,
Than seide he thus, “God woot, that of this game,
Whan al is wist, than am I not to blame!”
Therwith the sorwe so his herte shette,
That from his eyen fil ther not a tere
And every spirit his vigour inknette,
So they astoned and oppressed were.
The feling of his sorwe, or of his fere,
Or of ought elles, fled was out of towne;
And doun he fel al sodeinly aswowne.
This was no litel sorwe for to see;
But al was hust, and Pandare up as faste,
“O nece, pees, or we be lost,” quod he,
Beth nought agast”; but certein, at the laste,
For this or that, he into bedde him caste,
And seide, “O theef, is this a mannes herte?”
And of he rente al to his bare sherte;
And seide, “Nece, but ye helpe us now,
Allas, your owne Troilus is lorn!”
“Ywis, so wolde I, and I wiste how,
Ful fain,” quod she; “allas! that I was born!”
“Ye, nece, wol ye pullen out the thorn
That stiketh in his herte?” quod Pandare;
“Sey ‘al foryeve,’ and stint is al this fare!”
“Ye, that to me,” quod she, “ful lever were
Than al the good the sonne aboute gooth”;
And therwithal she swoor him in his ere,
“Ywis, my dere herte, I am nought wrooth,
Have here my trouthe and many another ooth;
Now speek to me, for it am I, Criseyde!”
But al for nought; yet mighte he not abreide.
Therwith his pous and pawmes of his hondes
They gan to frote, and wete his temples tweine,
And, to deliveren him from bittre bondes,
She ofte him kiste; and, shortly for to seyne,
Him to revoken she dide al hir peine.
And at the laste, he gan his breeth to drawe,
And of his swough sone after that adawe,
And gan bet minde and reson to him take,
But wonder sore he was abaist, ywis.
And with a sik, whan he gan bet awake,
He seide, “O mercy, God, what thing is this?”
“Why do ye with yourselven thus amis?”
Quod tho Criseyde, “Is this a mannes game?
What, Troilus! wol ye do thus, for shame?”
And therwithal hir arm over him she leide,
And al foryaf, and ofte time him keste.
He thonked hir, and to hir spak, and seide
As fil to purpos for his herte reste.
And she to that answerde him as hir leste;
And with hir goodly wordes him disporte
She gan, and ofte his sorwes to comforte.
Quod Pandarus, “For ought I can espyen,
This light nor I ne serven here of nought;
Light is not good for sike folkes yën.
But for the love of God, sin ye be brought
In thus good plit, lat now non hevy thought
Ben hanginge in the hertes of yow tweie”:
And bar the candel to the chimeneie.
Sone after this, though it no nede were,
Whan she swich othes as hir list devise
Hadde of him take, hir thoughte tho no fere,
Ne cause eek non, to bidde him thennes rise.
Yet lesse thing than othes may suffise
In many a cas; for every wight, I gesse,
That loveth wel meneth but gentilesse.
But in effect she wolde wite anoon
Of what man, and eek where, and also why
He jelous was, sin ther was cause noon;
And eek the signe, that he took it by,
She bad him that to telle hir bisily,
Or elles, certein, she bar him on honde,
That this was doon of malis, hir to fonde.
Withouten more, shortly for to seyne,
He moste obeye unto his lady heste;
And for the lasse harm, he moste feine.
He seide hir, whan she was at swiche a feste
She mighte on him han loked at the leste;
Not I not what, al dere ynough a risshe,
As he that nedes moste a cause fisshe.
Criseyde answerde, “Swete, al were it so,
What harm was that, sin I non ivel mene?
For, by that God that wroghte us bothe two,
In alle thinge is min entente clene.
Swich arguments ne been not worth a bene;
Wol ye the childish jalous contrefete?
Now were it worthy that ye were ybete.”
Tho Troilus gan sorwfully to sike,
Lest she be wrooth, him thoughte his herte deide;
And seide, “Allas! upon my sorwes sike
Have mercy, swete herte min, Criseyde!
And if that, in tho wordes that I seide,
Be any wrong, I wol no more trespace;
Do what yow list, I am al in your grace.”
Criseyde answerde, “Of gilt misericorde!
That is to seyn, that I foryeve al this;
And evermore on this night yow recorde,
And beth wel war ye do no more amis.”
“Nay, dere herte min,” quod he, “ywis.”
“And now,” quod she, “that I have do yow smerte,
Foryeve it me, min owene swete herte.”
This Troilus, with blisse of that supprised,
Put al in Goddes hond, as he that mente
No thing but wel; and, sodeinly avised,
He hir in armes faste to him hente.
And Pandarus, with a ful good entente,
Leide him to slepe, and seide, “If ye ben wise,
Swowneth not now, lest more folk arise.”
What mighte or may the sely larke seye,
Whan that the sparhauk hath it in his foot?
I can no more, but of thise ilke tweie,
To whom this tale sucre be or soot,
Though that I tarie a yeer, somtime I moot,
After min auctor, tellen hir gladnesse,
As wel as I have told hir hevinesse.
Criseyde, which that felte hir thus ytake,
As writen clerkes in hir bokes olde,
Right as an aspes leef she gan to quake,
Whan she him felte hir in his armes folde.
But Troilus, al hool of cares colde,
Gan thanken tho the blisful goddes sevene;
Thus sondry peines bringen folk to hevene.
This Troilus in armes gan hir streine,
And seide, “O swete, as ever mote I goon,
Now be ye caught, now is ther but we tweine;
Now yeldeth yow, for other boot is noon.”
To that Criseyde answerde thus anoon,
“N’adde I er now, my swete herte dere,
Ben yolde, ywis, I were now not here!”
O! sooth is seid, that heled for to be
As of a fevre or other greet siknesse,
Men moste drinke, as men may often see,
Ful bittre drink; and for to han gladnesse,
Men drinken ofte peine and greet distresse;
I mene it here, as for this aventure,
That thorugh a peine hath founden al his cure.
And now swetnesse semeth more sweet,
That bitternesse assayed was biforn;
For out of wo in blisse now they flete.
Non swich they felten, sith they were born;
Now is this bet, than bothe two be lorn!
For love of God, take every womman hede
To werken thus, if it comth to the nede.
Criseyde, al quit from every drede and tene,
As she that juste cause hadde him to triste,
Made him swich feste, it joye was to sene,
Whan she his trouthe and clene entente wiste.
And as aboute a tree, with many a twiste,
Bitrent and writh the sote wodebinde,
Gan eche of hem in armes other winde.
And as the newe abaisshed nightingale,
That stinteth first whan she biginneth singe,
Whan that she hereth any herde tale,
Or in the hegges any wight steringe,
And after siker dooth hir vois out ringe;
Right so Criseyde, whan hir drede stente,
Opned hir herte, and tolde him hir entente.
And right as he that seeth his deeth yshapen,
And deye moot, in ought that he may gesse,
And sodeinly rescous doth him escapen,
And from his deeth is brought in sikernesse,
For al this world, in swich present gladnesse
Was Troilus, and hath his lady swete;
With worse hap God lat us nevere mete!
Hir armes smale, hir streighte bak and softe,
Hir sides longe, fleshly, smothe, and white
He gan to stroke, and good thrift bad ful ofte
Hir snowish throte, hir brestes rounde and lite;
Thus in this hevene he gan him to delite,
And therwithal a thousand time hir kiste;
That, what to done, for joye unnethe he wiste.
Than seide he thus, “O, Love, O, Charitee,
Thy moder eek, Citherea the swete,
After thyself next heried be she,
Venus mene I, the welwilly planete;
And next yow, Imenëus, I thee grete;
For never man was to yow goddes holde
As I, which ye han brought fro cares colde.
Benigne Love, thou holy bond of thinges,
Whoso wol grace, and list thee nought honouren,
Lo, his desir wol flee withouten winges.
For, noldestow of bountee hem socouren
That serven best and most alwey labouren,
Yet were al lost, that dar I wel seyn, certes,
But if thy grace passed our desertes.
And for thou me, that coude leest deserve
Of hem that nombred been unto thy grace,
Hast holpen, ther I likly was to sterve,
And me bistowed in so heigh a place
That thilke boundes may no blisse pace,
I can no more, but laude and reverence
Be to thy bounte and thin excellence!”
And therwithal Criseyde anoon he kiste,
Of which, certein, she felte no disese.
And thus seide he, “Now wolde God I wiste,
Min herte swete, how I yow mighte plese!
What man,” quod he, “was ever thus at ese
As I, on whom the faireste and the beste
That ever I say, deineth hir herte reste.
Here may men seen that mercy passeth right;
The experience of that is felt in me,
That am unworthy to so swete a wight.
But herte min, of your benignitee,
So thinketh, though that I unworthy be,
Yet mot I nede amenden in som wise,
Right thourgh the vertu of your heigh servise.
And for the love of God, my lady dere,
Sin God hath wrought me for I shal yow serve,
As thus I mene, that ye wol be my stere,
To do me live, if that yow liste, or sterve,
So techeth me how that I may deserve
Your thank, so that I, thurgh min ignoraunce,
Ne do no thing that yow be displesaunce.
For certes, fresshe wommanliche wif,
This dar I seyn, that trouthe and diligence,
That shal ye finden in me al my lif,
Ny wol not, certein, breken your defence;
And if I do, present or in absence,
For love of God, lat slee me with the dede,
If that it like unto your womanhede.”
“Ywis,” quod she, “min owne hertes list,
My ground of ese, and al min herte dere,
Graunt mercy, for on that is al my trist;
But late us falle awey fro this matere;
For it suffiseth, this that seid is here.
And at o word, withouten repentaunce,
Welcome, my knight, my pees, my suffisaunce!”
Of hir delit, or joyes oon the leste
Were impossible to my wit to seye;
But juggeth, ye that han ben at the feste,
Of swich gladnesse, if that hem liste pleye!
I can no more, but thus thise ilke tweie
That night, betwixen dreed and sikernesse,
They felte in love the grete worthinesse.
O blisful night, of hem so longe ysought,
How blithe unto hem bothe two thou were!
Why nad I swich on with my soule ybought,
Ye, or the leeste joye that was there?
Awey, thou foule daunger and thou fere,
And lat hem in this heven blisse dwelle,
That is so heigh, that al ne can I telle!
But sooth is, though I can not tellen al,
As can min auctor, of his excellence,
Yet have I seid, and, God toforn, I shal
In every thing the gret of his sentence.
And if that I, at loves reverence,
Have any word in eched for the beste,
Doth therwithal right as yourselven leste.
For mine wordes, here and every part,
I speke hem alle under correccioun
Of yow, that feling han in loves art,
And putte it al in your discrecioun
T’encresse or maken diminucioun
Of my langage, and that I yow biseche;
But now to purpos of my rather speche.
Thise ilke two, that ben in armes laft,
So looth to hem asonder goon it were,
That ech from other wende been biraft,
Or elles, lo, this was hir moste fere,
That al this thing but nice dremes were;
For which ful ofte ech of hem seide, “O swete,
Clippe ich yow thus, or elles I it mete?”
And, Lord! so he gan goodly on hir see,
That never his look ne bleinte from hir face,
And seide, “O dere herte, may it be
That it be sooth, that ye ben in this place?”
“Ye, herte min, God thank I of his grace!”
Quod tho Criseyde, and therwithal him kiste,
That where his spirit was, for joye he niste.
This Troilus ful ofte hir eyen two
Gan for to kisse, and seide, “O eyen clere,
It were ye that wroughte me swich wo,
Ye humble nettes of my lady dere!
Though ther be mercy writen in your chere,
God wot, the text ful hard is, sooth, to finde,
How coude ye withouten bond me binde?”
Therwith he gan hir faste in armes take,
And wel an hundred times gan he sike,
Nought swiche sorwful sikes as men make
For wo, or elles whan that folk ben sike,
But esy sikes, swiche as been to like,
That shewed his affeccioun withinne;
Of swiche sikes coude he nought blinne.
Sone after this they spake of sondry thinges,
As fil to purpos of this aventure,
And pleyinge entrechaungeden hir ringes,
Of which I can nought tellen no scripture;
But wel I woot a broch, gold and asure,
In whiche a ruby set was lik an herte,
Criseyde him yaf, and stak it on his sherte.
Lord! trowe ye, a coveitous, a wrecche,
That blameth love and holt of it despit,
That, of tho pens that he can mokre and kecche,
Was ever yet y-yeve him swich delit,
As is in love, in oo point, in som plit?
Nay, doutelees, for also God me save,
So parfit joye may no nigard have!
They wol sey “Yis,” but Lord! so that they lie,
Tho bisy wrecches, ful of wo and drede!
They callen love a woodnesse or folie,
But it shal falle hem as I shal yow rede;
They shul forgo the white and ek the rede,
And live in wo, ther God yeve hem mischaunce,
And every lover in his trouthe avaunce!
As wolde God, tho wrecches, that dispise
Servise of love, hadde eres also longe
As hadde Mida, ful of coveitise;
And therto dronken hadde as hoot and stronge
As Crassus did for his affectis wronge,
To techen hem that coveitise is vice,
And love is vertu thogh men holde hem nice!
Thise ilke two, of whom that I yow seye,
Whan that hir hertes wel assured were,
Tho gonne they to speken and to pleye,
And eek rehercen how, and whanne, and where,
They knewe hem first, and every wo and fere
That passed was; but al swich hevinesse,
I thanke it God, was tourned to gladnesse.
And evermo, whan that hem fel to speke
Of any thing of swich a time agoon,
With kissing al that tale sholde breke,
And fallen in a newe joye anoon,
And diden al hir might, sin they were oon,
For to recoveren blisse and been at ese,
And passed wo with joye countrepeise.
Reson wil not that I speke of sleep,
For it accordeth nought to my matere;
God woot, they toke of that ful litel keep,
But lest this night, that was to hem so dere,
Ne sholde in vein escape in no manere,
It was biset in joye and bisinesse
Of al that souneth into gentilnesse.
But whan the cok, comune astrologer,
Gan on his brest to bete, and after crowe,
And Lucifer, the dayes messager,
Gan for to rise, and out hir bemes throwe;
And estward roos, to him that coude it knowe,
Fortuna maior, than anoon Criseyde,
With herte sore, to Troilus thus seide:—
“Min hertes lif, my trist, al my plesaunce,
That I was born, allas! what me is wo,
That day of us mot make desseveraunce!
For time it is to rise, and hennes go,
Or elles I am lost for evermo!
O night, allas! why niltow over us hove,
As longe as whanne Almena lay by Jove?
“O blake night, as folk in bokes rede,
That shapen art by God this world to hide
At certein times with thy derke wede,
That under that men mighte in reste abide,
Wel oughte bestes pleine, and folk thee chide,
That thereas day with labour wolde us breste,
That thou thus fleest, and deinest us nought reste!
“Thou dost, allas! to shortly thin office,
Thou rakel night, ther God, makere of kinde,
Thee, for thin hast and thin unkinde vice,
So faste ay to our hemispere binde,
That never more under the ground thou winde!
For now, for thou so hyest out of Troye,
Have I forgon thus hastily my joye!”
This Troilus, that with tho wordes felte,
As thoughte him tho, for pietous distresse,
The blody teres from his herte melte,
As he that never yet swich hevinesse
Assayed hadde, out of so greet gladnesse,
Gan therwithal Criseyde his lady dere
In armes streine, and seide in this manere:—
“O cruel day, accusour of the joye
That night and love han stole and faste ywryen,
Acursed be thy coming into Troye,
For every bore hath oon of thy bright yën!
Envious day, what list thee so to spyen?
What hastow lost, why sekestow this place,
Ther God thy light so quenche, for his grace?
“Allas! what han thise loveres thee agilt,
Dispitous day? thin be the pine of helle!
For many a lovere hastow shent, and wilt;
Thy pouring in wol nowher lete hem dwelle.
What proferestow thy light here for to selle?
Go selle it hem that smale seles graven;
We wol thee nought, us nedeth no day haven.”
And eek the sonne Titan gan he chide,
And seide, “O fool, wel may men thee dispise,
That hast the dawing al night by thy side,
And suffrest hir so sone up fro thee rise,
For to disesen loveres in this wise.
What! hold your bed ther, thou, and eek thy morwe!
I bidde God, so yeve yow bothe sorwe!”
Therwith ful sore he sighte, and thus he seide,
“My lady right, and of my wele or wo
The welle and rote, O goodly min, Criseyde,
And shal I rise, allas! and shal I go?
Now fele I that min herte moot atwo!
For how sholde I my lif an houre save,
Sin that with yow is al the lif I have?
“What shal I doon, for certes, I not how,
Ne whanne, allas! I shal the time see,
That in this plit I may be eft with yow;
And of my lif, God woot, how that shal be,
Sin that desir right now so biteth me,
That I am deed anoon, but I retourne.
How sholde I longe, allas! fro yow sojourne?
“But nathelees, min owen lady bright,
Yit were it so that I wiste outrely,
That I, your humble servaunt and your knight,
Were in your herte yset so fermely
As ye in min, the which thing, trewely,
Me lever were than thise worldes tweine,
Yet sholde I bet enduren al my peine.”
To that Criseyde answerde right anoon,
And with a sik she seide, “O herte dere,
The game, ywis, so ferforth now is goon,
That first shal Phebus falle fro his spere,
And every egle been the dowves fere,
And every roche out of his place sterte,
Er Troilus out of Criseydes herte!
“Ye be so depe inwith min herte grave,
That, though I wolde it turne out of my thought,
As wisly verray God my soule save,
To dyen in the peine, I coude nought!
And, for the love of God that us hath wrought,
Lat in your brain non other fantasie
So crepe, that it cause me to die!
“And that ye me wolde han as faste in minde
As I have yow, that wolde I yow biseche;
And, if I wiste soothly that to finde,
God mighte not a point my joyes eche!
But, herte min, withoute more speche,
Beth to me trewe, or elles were it routhe;
For I am thin, by God and by my trouthe!
“Beth glad forthy, and live in sikernesse;
Thus seide I never er this, ne shal to mo;
And if to yow it were a gret gladnesse
To turne ayein, soone after that ye go,
As fain wolde I as ye, it were so,
As wisly God min herte bringe at reste!”
And him in armes took, and ofte keste.
Agains his wil, sin it mot nedes be,
This Troilus up roos, and faste him cledde,
And in his armes took his lady free
An hundred time, and on his wey him spedde,
And with swich wordes as his herte bledde,
He seide, “Farewel, my dere herte swete,
Ther God us graunte sounde and sone to mete!”
To which no word for sorwe she answerde,
So sore gan his parting hir destreine;
And Troilus unto his palais ferde,
As woo bigon as she was, sooth to seyne;
So hard him wrong of sharp desir the peine
For to ben eft there he was in plesaunce,
That it may never out of his remembraunce.
Retorned to his real palais, sone
He softe into his bed gan for to slinke,
To slepe longe, as he was wont to done,
But al for nought; he may wel ligge and winke,
But sleep ne may ther in his herte sinke;
Thinking how she, for whom desir him brende,
A thousandfold was worth more than he wende.
And in his thought gan up and doun to winde
Hir wordes alle, and every contenaunce,
And fermely impressen in his minde
The leste point that to him was plesaunce;
And verrailiche, of thilke remembraunce,
Desir al newe him brende, and lust to brede
Gan more than erst, and yet took he non hede.
Criseyde also, right in the same wise,
Of Troilus gan in hir herte shette
His worthinesse, his lust, his dedes wise,
His gentilesse, and how she with him mette,
Thonking Love he so wel hir bisette;
Desiring eft to have hir herte dere
In swich a plit, she dorste make him chere.
Pandare amorwe which that comen was
Unto his nece, and gan hir faire grete,
Seide, “Al this night so reined it, allas!
That al my drede is that ye, nece swete,
Han litel laiser had to slepe and mete;
Al night,” quod he, “hath rein so do me wake,
That som of us, I trowe, hir hedes ake.”
And ner he com, and seid, “How stont it now
This mery morwe, nece, how can ye fare?”
Criseyde answerd, “Never the bet for yow,
Fox that ye been, God yeve your herte care!
God helpe me so, ye caused al this fare,
Trow I,” quod she, “for al your wordes white;
O! whoso seeth yow knoweth yow ful lite!”
With that she gan hir face for to wrie
With the shete, and wex for shame al reed;
And Pandarus gan under for to prie,
And seide, “Nece, if that I shal ben deed,
Have here a swerd, and smiteth of min heed.”
With that his arm al sodeinly he thriste
Under hir nekke, and at the laste hir kiste.
I passe al that which chargeth nought to seye,
What! God foryaf his deeth, and she also
Foryaf, and with hir uncle gan to pleye,
For other cause was ther noon than so.
But of this thing right to the effect to go,
Whan time was, hom til hir hous she wente,
And Pandarus hath fully his entente.
Now torne we ayein to Troilus,
That resteles ful longe abedde lay,
And prevely sente after Pandarus,
To him to come in al the haste he may.
He com anoon, nought ones seide he “Nay,”
And Troilus ful sobrely he grette,
And doun upon his beddes side him sette.
This Troilus, with al the affeccioun
Of frendes love that herte may devise,
To Pandarus on kneës fil adoun,
And er that he wolde of the place arise,
He gan him thonken in his beste wise;
A hondred sithe he gan the time blesse,
That he was born to bringe him fro distresse.
He seide, “O frend, of frendes the alderbeste
That ever was, the sothe for to telle,
Thou hast in hevene ybrought my soule at reste
Fro Flegiton, the fery flood of helle;
That, though I mighte a thousand times selle,
Upon a day, my lif in thy servise,
It mighte nought a mote in that suffise.
The sonne, which that al the world may see,
Saw never yet, my lif that dar I leye,
So inly fair and goodly as is she,
Whos I am al, and shal, til that I deie;
And, that I thus am hires, dar I seye,
That thanked be the heighe worthinesse
Of love, and eek thy kinde bisinesse.
Thus hastow me no litel thing iyive,
For which to thee obliged be for ay
My lif, and why? for thorugh thin help I live;
For elles deed hadde I be many a day.”
And with that word doun in his bed he lay,
And Pandarus ful sobrely him herde
Til al was seid, and thanne he him answerde:
“My dere frend, if I have doon for thee
In any cas, God wot, it is me leef;
And am as glad as man may of it be,
God help me so; but tak now not agreef
That I shal seyn, be war of this mischeef,
That, there as thou now brought art into blisse,
That thou thyself ne cause it nought to misse.
For of fortunes sharp adversitee
The worst kinde of infortune is this,
A man to have ben in prosperitee,
And it remembren, whan it passed is.
Th’art wis ynough, forthy do nought amis;
Be not to rakel, though thou sitte warme,
For if thou be, certein, it wol thee harme.
“Thou art at ese, and hold thee wel therinne.
For also seur as reed is every fir,
As greet a craft is kepe wel as winne;
Bridle alwey wel thy speche and thy desir.
For worldly joye halt not but by a wir;
That preveth wel, it brest alday so ofte;
Forthy nede is to werke with it softe.”
Quod Troilus, “I hope, and God toforn,
My dere frend, that I shal so me bere,
That in my gilt ther shal no thing be lorn,
Ny nil not rakle as for to greven here;
It nedeth not this matere ofte stere;
For wistestow min herte wel, Pandare,
God woot, of this thou woldest litel care.”
Tho gan he telle him of his glade night.
And wherof first his herte dredde, and how,
And seide, “Freend, as I am trewe knight,
And by that feith I shal to God and yow,
I hadde it never half so hote as now;
And ay the more that desir me biteth
To love hir best, the more it me deliteth.
“I noot myself not wisly what it is;
But now I fele a newe qualitee,
Ye, al another than I dide er this.”
Pandare answerde, and seide thus, that he
That ones may in heven blisse be,
He feleth other weyes, dar I leye,
Than thilke time he first herde of it seye.
This is o word for al; this Troilus
Was never ful to speke of this matere,
And for to preisen unto Pandarus
The bountee of his righte lady dere,
And Pandarus to thanke and maken chere.
This tale ay was span newe to biginne
Til that the night departed hem atwinne.
Sone after this, for that fortune it wolde,
Icomen was the blisful time swete,
That Troilus was warned that he sholde,
Ther he was erst, Criseyde his lady mete;
For which he felte his herte in joye flete;
And feithfully gan alle the goddes herie;
And lat see now if that he can be merie.
And holden was the forme and al the wise,
Of hir cominge, and eek of his also,
As it was erst, which nedeth nought devise.
But plainly to the effect right for to go,
In joye and seurte Pandarus hem two
Abedde broughte, whan hem bothe leste,
And thus they ben in quiete and in reste.
Nought nedeth it to yow, sin they ben met,
To aske at me if that they blithe were;
For if it erst was wel, tho was it bet
A thousandfold, this nedeth not enquere.
Agon was every sorwe and every fere;
And bothe, ywis, they hadde, and so they wende,
As muche joye as hert may comprehende.
This is no litel thing of for to seye,
This passeth every wit for to devise;
For eche of hem gan otheres lust obeye;
Felicitee, which that thise clerkes wise
Commenden so, ne may not here suffise.
This joye may not writen been with inke,
This passeth al that herte may bithinke.
But cruel day, so welawey the stounde!
Gan for to aproche, as they by signes knewe,
For whiche hem thoughte felen detheswounde;
So wo was hem, that changen gan hir hewe,
And day they gonnen to dispise al newe,
Calling it traitour, envious, and worse,
And bitterly the dayes light they curse.
Quod Troilus, “Allas! now am I war
That Pirous and tho swifte stedes three,
Whiche that drawen forth the sonnes char,
Han goon som bypath in despit of me;
That maketh it so sone day to be;
And, for the sonne him hasteth thus to rise,
Ne shal I never doon him sacrifise!”
But nedes day departe moste hem sone,
And whanne hir speche doon was and hir chere,
They twinne anoon as they were wont to done,
And setten time of meting eft yfere;
And many a night they wroughte in this manere.
And thus Fortune a time ladde in joye
Criseyde, and eek this kinges sone of Troye.
In suffisaunce, in blisse, and in singinges,
This Troilus gan al his lif to lede;
He spendeth, jousteth, maketh festeyinges;
He yeveth frely ofte, and chaungeth wede,
And held aboute him alwey, out of drede,
A world of folk, as cam him wel of kinde,
The fressheste and the beste he coude finde;
That swich a vois was of him and a stevene
Thorughout the world, of honour and largesse,
That it up rong unto the yate of hevene.
And, as in love, he was in swich gladnesse,
That in his herte he demede, as I gesse,
That there nis lovere in this world at ese
So wel as he, and thus gan love him plese.
The godlihede or beautee which that kinde
In any other lady hadde yset
Can not the mountaunce of a knot unbinde,
Aboute his herte, of al Criseydes net.
He was so narwe ymasked and yknet,
That it undon on any maner side,
That nil not been, for ought that may betide.
And by the hond ful ofte he wolde take
This Pandarus, and into gardin lede,
And swich a feste and swich a proces make
Him of Criseyde, and of hir womanhede,
And of hir beautee, that, withouten drede,
It was an hevene his wordes for to here;
And thanne he wolde singe in this manere.
“Love, that of erthe and see hath governaunce,
Love, that his hestes hath in heven hie,
Love, that with an holsom alliaunce
Halt peples joined, as him list hem gie,
Love, that knetteth lawe of companie,
And couples doth in vertu for to dwelle,
Bind this acord, that I have told and telle;
“That that the world with feith, which that is stable,
Diverseth so his stoundes concordinge,
That elements that been so discordable
Holden a bond perpetuely duringe,
That Phebus mote his rosy day forth bringe,
And that the moone hath lordship over nightes,
Al this doth Love; ay heried be his mightes!
“That that the see, that gredy is to flowen,
Constreineth to a certein ende so
His flodes, that so fersly they ne growen
To drenchen erthe and al for evermo;
And if that Love ought lete his bridel go,
Al that now loveth asonder sholde lepe,
And lost were al, that Love halt now tohepe.
“So wolde God, that auctor is of kinde,
That, with his bond, Love of his vertu liste
To cerclen hertes alle, and faste binde,
That from his bond no wight the wey out wiste.
And hertes colde, hem wolde I that he twiste
To make hem love, and that hem liste ay rewe
On hertes sore, and kepe hem that ben trewe.”
In alle nedes, for the tounes werre,
He was and ay the firste in armes dight;
And certeinly, but if that bokes erre,
Save Ector, most ydrad of any wight;
And this encrees of hardinesse and might
Cam him of love, his ladies thank to winne,
That altered his spirit so withinne.
In time of trewe, on haukinge wolde he ride,
Or elles hunten boor, bere, or lioun;
The smale bestes leet he gon biside.
And whan that he com ridinge into toun,
Ful ofte his lady, from hir window doun,
As fresh as faucon comen out of muwe,
Ful redy was, him goodly to saluwe.
And most of love and vertu was his speche,
And in despit hadde alle wrecchednesse;
And doutelees, no nede was him biseche
To honouren hem that hadde worthinesse,
And esen hem that weren in distresse.
And glad was he if any wight wel ferde,
That lover was, whan he it wiste or herde.
For sooth to seyn, he lost held every wight
But if he were in loves heigh servise,
I mene folk that oughte it been of right.
And over al this, so wel coude he devise
Of sentement, and in so unkouth wise
Al his array, that every lover thoughte,
That al was wel, whatso he seide or wroughte.
And though that he be come of blood royal,
Him liste of pride at no wight for to chase;
Benigne he was to ech in general,
For which he gat him thank in every place.
Thus wolde Love, yheried be his grace,
That pride, and ire, envie and avarice
He gan to flee, and every other vice.
Thou lady bright, the doughter to Dione,
Thy blinde and winged sone eek, daun Cupide;
Ye sustren nine eek, that by Elicone
In hil Parnaso listen for to abide,
That ye thus fer han deined me to gide,
I can no more, but sin that ye wol wende,
Ye heried been for ay, withouten ende!
Thourgh yow have I seid fully in my song
Theffect and joye of Troilus servise,
Al be that ther was som disese among,
As to min auctor listeth to devise.
My thridde book now ende ich in this wise;
And Troilus in luste and in quiete
Is with Criseyde, his owne herte swete.
