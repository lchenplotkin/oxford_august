¶With this Chanoun I dwelt have seven yeer,
And of his science am I never the neer.°
Al that I hadde, I have ylost therby;
And God wot,° so hath many mo° than I.
Ther° I was wont° to be right fresh and gay
Of clothing and of other good array,
Now may I were° an hose° upon min heed;
And wher my colour was both fresh and reed,
Now is it wan° and of a leden hewe;
Whoso it useth,° sore° shal he rewe.°
And of my swink° yet blered is min ye,°
Lo! which° avantage is to multiplie!
That sliding° science hath me maad so bare,
That I have no good,° wher that evere I fare;°
And yet I am endetted so therby
Of° gold that I have borwed, trewely,
That whil I live, I shal it quite° nevere.
Lat every man be war° by me for evere!
What maner man that casteth him° therto,
If he continue, I holde° his thrift° ydo.°
So help me God, therby shal he nat winne,
But empte his purs, and make his wittes thinne.°
And whan he, thurgh his madnesse and folie,
Hath lost his owne good thurgh jupartie,°
Thanne he exciteth other folk therto,
To lese hir good° as he himself hath do.°
For unto shrewes° joye it is and ese
To have hir felawes in peine and disese;°
Thus was I ones lerned of° a clerk.
Of that no charge,° I wol speke of our werk.

¶Whan we been there as° we shul exercise
Oure elvissh° craft, we semen wonder wise,
Our termes° been so clergial° and so queinte.°
I blow the fir til that° min herte feinte.°
What° sholde I tellen ech proporcioun
Of thinges whiche that we werche upon,
As on five or sixe ounces, may wel be,
Of silver or som other quantite,
And bisie me° to telle yow the names
Of orpiment,° brent° bones, iren squames,°
That into poudre grounden been ful smal?
And in an erthen pot how put is al,
And salt yput in, and also papeer,°
Biforn thise poudres that I speke of heer,
And wel ycovered with a lampe° of glas,
And mochel other thing° which that ther was?
And of the pot and glasses enluting,°
That of° the eire might passe out nothing?°
And of the esy° fir and smart° also,
Which that was maad, and of the care and wo
That we hadde in our matires° subliming,°
And in amalgaming° and calcining°
Of quiksilver,° yclept° Mercurie crude?
For alle our sleightes° we can nat conclude.°
Oure orpiment° and sublimed° mercurie,
Our grounden litarge° eek on the porphurie,°
Of ech of thise of ounces a certein°
Nought° helpeth us, our labour is in vein.
Ne° eek° our spirites ascencioun,°
Ne our materes that lyen al fixe° adoun,
Mowe° in our werking nothing us availe.
For lost is al our labour and travaile,°
And al the cost, a twenty devel weye,°
Is lost also, which we upon it leye.

¶Ther is also ful many another thing
That is unto our craft apertening;
Though I by ordre hem nat reherce° can,
Bicause that I am a lewed° man,
Yet wol I telle hem as they come to minde,
Though I ne can nat sette hem° in hir kinde;°
As bole armoniak,° vertgrees,° boras,°
And sondry vessels maad of erthe° and glas,
Oure urinales° and our descensories,°
Violes,° crosletz,° and sublimatories,°
Cucurbites, and alembikes° eek,
And other swiche, dere ynough a leek°
Nat nedeth it° for to reherce hem alle,
Watres rubifying° and boles galle,°
Arsenek, sal armoniak,° and brimstoon;°
And herbes coude I telle eek many oon,
As egremoin,° valerian,° and lunarie,°
And other swiche, if that me liste° tarie.°
Our lampes brenning bothe night and day,
To bringe aboute our purpos, if we may.
Our fourneis° eek of calcinacioun,°
And of watres albificacioun,°
Unslekked lim,° chalk, and gleire of an ey,°
Poudres diverse, asshes, dong,° pisse, and cley,
Cered pokets,° sal peter,° vitriole;°
And divers fires maad of wode and cole;
Sal tartre,° alkaly, and sal preparat,°
And combust° maters and coagulat,°
Cley maad with hors or mannes heer,° and oile
Of tartre,° alum glas,° berm,° wort,° and argoile,°
Resalgar,° and our maters enbibing;°
And eek of our maters encorporing,°
And of our silver citrinacioun,°
Our cementing° and fermentacioun,
Oure ingottes, testes,° and many mo.

¶I wol yow telle, as was me taught also,
The foure spirits and the bodies sevene,
By ordre, as ofte I herd my lord hem nevene.°
The first spirit quiksilver called is,
The seconde orpiment,° the thridde, ywis,
Sal armoniak,° and the ferth brimstoon.°
The bodies sevene eek, lo! hem heer anoon:
Sol gold is, and Luna silver we threpe,°
Mars iren, Mercurie quiksilver we clepe,°
Saturnus leed, and Jupiter is tin,
And Venus coper, by my fader kin!

¶This cursed craft whoso wole exercise,
He shal no good han that him may suffise;
For al the good he spendeth theraboute,
He lese° shal, therof have I no doute.
Whoso that° listeth° outen° his folie,
Lat him com forth, and lerne multiplie;°
And every man that oght° hath in his cofre,
Lat him appere, and wexe° a philosofre,
Ascaunce° that craft is so light° to lere!°
Nay, nay, God woot,° al be he° monk or frere,
Preest or chanoun, or any other wight,
Though he sitte at his book both day and night,
In lerning of this elvish° nice° lore,
Al is in vein,° and parde,° muchel more!
To lerne° a lewed man this subtiltee,°
Fy! spek nat therof, for it wol nat be;
And konne he letterure,° or konne he noon,
As in effect, he shal finde it al oon.°
For bothe two, by my savacioun,°
Concluden, in multiplicacioun,°
Ilike wel,° whan they han al ydo;°
This is to seyn, they faillen bothe two.

¶Yet forgat I to maken rehersaille°
Of watres corosif° and of limaille,°
And of bodies mollificacioun,°
And also of hire induracioun,°
Oiles, ablucions,° and metal fusible,°
To tellen al wold passen° any bible°
That owher° is; wherfore, as for the beste,
Of al thes names now wol I me reste.
For, as I trowe, I have yow told ynowe°
To reise° a feend, al looke he never so rowe.°

¶A! nay! lat be; the philosophres stoon,
“Elixir” clept,° we sechen faste° echoon;
For had we him,° than wer we siker ynow.°
But, unto God of hevene I make avow,
For al our craft, whan we han al ydo,
And al our sleighte,° he wol nat come us to.
He hath ymaad us spenden muchel good,
For sorwe of which almost we wexen wood,°
But° that good hope crepeth in our herte,
Supposinge ever, though we sore smerte,°
To be releved by him afterward;
Swich supposing and hope is sharp° and hard;°
I warn yow wel, it is to seken ever;°
That futur temps° hath maad men to dissever,°
In trust therof, from al that ever they hadde.
Yet of that art they can nat wexen sadde,°
For unto hem it is a bitter swete;
So semeth it; for nad they° but a shete
Which that they mighte wrappe hem inne at night,
And a brat° to walke inne by daylight,
They wolde hem selle and spenden on this craft;
They can nat stinte° til nothing be laft.
And evermore, wher that ever° they goon,
Men may hem knowe by smel of brimstoon;
For al the world, they stinken as a goot;°
Hir savour° is so rammish° and so hoot,°
That, though a man a mile from hem be,
The savour° wole infecte° him, trusteth me;
Lo, thus by smellinge and threedbare array,
If that men list,° this folk they knowe may.
And if a man wole aske hem prively,°
Why they been clothed so unthriftily,°
They right anon° wol rownen° in his ere,
And seyn, that if that they espied° were,
Men wolde hem slee,° bicause of hir science;
Lo, thus this folk bitrayen innocence!

¶Passe over this; I go my tale unto.
Er than° the pot be on the fir ydo,°
Of metals with a certein quantite,
My lord hem tempreth,° and no man but he—
Now he is goon, I dar seyn boldely—
For, as men seyn, he can doon craftily;°
Algate° I wool wel he hath swich a name,
And yet ful ofte he renneth in a blame;°
And wit° ye how? ful ofte it happeth so,
The pot tobreketh,° and farwel! al is go!
Thes metals been of so greet violence,
Our walles mow° nat make hem resistence,
But if° they weren wroght of lim° and stoon;
They percen so, and thurgh the wal they goon,
And somme of hem sinken into the ground—
Thus han we lost bitimes° many a pound—
And somme are scatered al the floor aboute,
Som lepe° into the roof; withouten doute,
Though that the feend noght in our sighte him shewe,
I trowe he with us be, that ilke° shrewe!°
In helle wher that he is lord and sire,
Nis ther° moor wo, ne moor rancour ne ire.
Whan that our pot is broke, as I have said,
Every man chit,° and halt him ivele apaid.°

¶Som seide, it was long° on the fir making,
Som seide, nay! it was on the blowing;°
(Than was I fered,° for that was min office°);
“Straw!”° quod the thridde, “Ye been lewed° and nice,°
It was nat tempred as it oghte be.”
“Nay!” quod the fourthe, “stint,° and herkne me;°
Bicause our fir ne was nat° maad of beech,
That is the cause, and other noon, so theech!”°
I can nat telle wheron it was long,°
But wel I wot° greet strif is us among.
“What!” quod my lord, “ther is namoor to done,
Of thise perils I wol be war° eftsone;°
I am right siker° that the pot was crased.°
Be as be may, be ye nothing amased;°
As usage° is, lat sweep the floor as swithe,°
Plukke up your hertes, and beth glad and blithe.”°

¶The mullok° on an hepe ysweped° was,
And on the floor ycast° a canevas,°
And al this mullok in a sive° ythrowe,°
And sifted, and ypiked° many a throwe.°
“Pardee,” quod oon, “somwhat° of our metal
Yet is ther heer, though that we han nat al.
Although this thing mishapped have° as now,°
Another time it may be wel ynow,
Us moste putte our good in aventure;°
A marchant, parde! may nat ay endure,
Trusteth me wel, in his prosperitee;
Somtime his good is drenched° in the see,
And somtim comth it sauf° unto the londe.”
“Pees!” quod my lord, “The next time I shal fonde°
To bringe our craft al in another plite;°
And but° I do, sirs, lat me han the wite;°
Ther was defaute° in somwhat,° wel I woot.”

¶Another seid, the fir was over hoot:°—
But, be it hoot or cold, I dar sey this,
That we concluden° evermoore amis.°
We faile of° that which that we wolden have,
And in our madnesse evermoore we rave.
And whan we been togidres everichoon,°
Every man semeth as wis as Salomon.
But al thing which that shineth as the gold
Nis nat° gold, as that I have herd it told;
Ne every appel that is fair at eye°
Ne is nat good, whatso° men clappe° or crye.
Right so, lo! fareth it amonges us;
He that semeth the wisest, by Jhesus!
Is most fool, whan it cometh to the preef;°
And he that semeth trewest is a theef;°
That shul ye knowe, er that I fro yow wende,°

By that° I of my tale have maad an ende.

¶Ther is a chanoun of religioun
Amonges us, wolde° infecte al a toun,
Thogh it as greet° were as was Ninivee,°
Rome, Alisaundre,° Troye, and othere three.
His sleightes° and his infinit falsnesse
Ther coude no man writen, as I gesse,
Thogh that° he live mighte a thousand yeer.
In al this world of falshed nis° his peer;
For in his termes° so he wolde him winde,°
And speke his wordes in so sly a kinde,°
Whan he commune° shal with any wight,
That he wol make him doten° anon right,°
But° it a feend° be, as himselven is.
Ful many a man hath he bigiled er this,
And wole, if that he live may a while;
And yet men ride and goon ful many a mile
Him for to seke and have his aqueintaunce,
Noght knowinge of his false governaunce.°
And if yow list° to yeve me audience,
I wol it telle here in your presence.

¶But worshipful chanons religious,
Ne demeth nat° that I sclaundre° your hous,
Although that my tale of a chanoun be.
Of every ordre° som shrewe° is, parde,
And God forbed that al a compaignie
Shold rewe° a singuler mannes folie.
To sclaundre yow is nothing° min entente,
But to correcten that is mis° I mente.°
This tale was nat only told for yow,
But eek for other mo;° ye woot wel how
That, among Cristes apostelles twelve,
Ther nas no° traitour but Judas himselve.
Than why sholde al the remenant have blame
That giltlees were? by° yow I sey the same.
Save only this, if ye wol herkne me,
If any Judas in your covent be,
Remeveth him bitimes,° I yow rede,°
If shame or los may causen any drede.
And beth nothing° displesed, I yow preye,
But in this cas herkneth what I shal seye.

¶In London was a preest annueleer,°
That therin dwelled had many a yeer,
Which° was so plesaunt and so servisable°
Unto the wif, whereas° he was at table,°
That she wold suffre° him nothing for to paye
For bord° ne clothing, wente he never so gaye;°
And spending silver hadde he right ynow.°
Therof no fors;° I wol procede as now,
And telle forth my tale of the chanon,
That broghte this preest to confusioun.°

¶This false chanon cam upon a day
Unto this preestes chambre, wher he lay,
Biseching him to lene° him a certein°
Of gold, and he wold quite it him agein.°
“Leen me a mark,” quod he, “but° dayes three,
And at my day I wol it quiten thee.
And if so be that thou me finde fals,
Another day do hang me by the hals!”°

¶This preest him took° a mark, and that as swithe,°
And this chanon him thanked ofte sithe,°
And took his leve, and wente forth his weye,°
And at the thridde day broghte his moneie,
And to the preest he took° his gold again,
Wherof° this preest was wonder glad and fain.°

¶“Certes,” quod he, “nothing anoyeth me°
To lene a man a noble,° or two or three,
Or what thing were in my possessioun,
Whan he so trewe° is of condicioun,°
That in no wise° he breke wole his day;°
To swich a man I can never sey nay.”
“What!” quod this chanon, “sholde I be untrewe?
Nay, that wer° thing yfallen° al of newe.°
Trouthe° is a thing that I wol ever kepe
Unto that day in which that I shal crepe
Into my grave, and elles° God forbed;
Bileveth this as siker° as the crede.°
God thanke I, and in good time be it said,
That ther was never man yet ivele apaid°
For gold ne silver that he to me lente,
Ne never falshede in min herte I mente.
And sir,” quod he, “now of my privetee,°
Sin ye so goodlich° han been unto me,
And kithed° to me so greet gentillesse,°
Somwhat° to quite with your° kindenesse,
I wol yow shewe, and, if yow list to lere,°
I wol yow teche pleinly the manere,
How I can werken in philosophie.°
Taketh good heed,° ye shul wel seen at eye,°
That I wol doon a maistrie° er I go.”
“Ye,” quod the preest, “ye, sir, and wol ye° so?
Marie! therof° I pray° yow hertely!”°
“At your comandement, sir, trewely,”
Quod the chanon, “and elles° God forbede!”

¶Lo, how this theef° coude his servise bede!°
Ful sooth it is, that swich profred° servise
Stinketh, as witnessen thise olde wise;°
And that ful sone I wol it verifie
In this chanon, rote° of al trecherie,
That evermoor° delit hath and gladnesse—
Swich feendly° thoughtes in his herte impresse—
How Cristes peple he may to meschief° bringe;
God kepe us from his fals dissimulinge!°

¶Noght wiste° this preest with whom that he delte,
Ne° of his harm cominge he nothing felte.°
O sely° preest! o sely innocent!
With coveitise anon thou shalt be blent!°
O gracelees,° ful blind is thy conceit,°
Nothing ne artow° war of the deceit
Which that this fox yshapen° hath to° thee!
His wily wrenches° thou ne mayst nat flee.
Wherfor, to go to the conclusioun
That refereth to° thy confusioun,
Unhappy° man! anon I wol me hie°
To tellen thin unwit° and thy folie,
And eek the falsnesse of that other wrecche,
As ferforth as that° my conning° may strecche.

¶This chanon was my lord, ye wolden wene?°
Sir Host, in feith, and by the hevens quene,°
It was another chanon, and nat he,
That can° an hundred fold moor subtiltee!°
He hath bitrayed folkes many time;
Of his falshede it dulleth° me to rime.°
Ever whan° that I speke of his falshede,
For shame of him my chekes wexen° rede;
Algates,° they biginnen for to glowe,
For rednesse have I noon, right wel I knowe,
In my visage;° for° fumes diverse
Of metals, which ye han herd me reherce,
Consumed han and wasted° my reednesse.
Now tak heede of° this chanons cursednesse!

¶“Sir,” quod he to the preest, “lat° your man gon°
For quiksilver,° that° we hadde it anon;°
And lat him bringen ounces two or three;
And whan he comth, as faste° shal ye see
A wonder thing, which ye saugh nevere er° this.”
“Sir,” quod the preest, “it shall be doon, ywis.”°
He bad his servant fecchen him this thing,
And he al redy was at his bidding,
And wente him forth, and cam anon again
With this quiksilver, soothly° for to sayn,
And took thise ounces three to the chanoun;
And he hem leide faire° and wel adoun,
And bad the servant coles° for to bringe,
That he anon might go to his werkinge.

¶The coles right anon weren yfet,°
And this chanon took out a crosselet°
Of° his bosom, and shewed it to the preest.
“This instrument,” quod he, “which that thou seest,
Taake in thin hand, and put thyself therinne
Of this quiksilver an ounce, and heer biginne,
In name of Crist, to wexe a philosofre.°
Ther been ful few which that I wolde profre°
To shewen hem thus muche of my science.
For ye shul seen heer, by experience,
That this quiksilver wol I mortifie°
Right in your sighte anon,° withouten lie,
And make it as good silver and as fin
As ther is any in your purs or min,
Or elleswhere, and make it malliable;
And elles, holdeth me° fals and unable°
Amonges folk for ever to appere!
I have a poudre heer, that cost me dere,
Shal° make al good, for it is cause of al
My conning, which that I yow shewen shal.
Voideth° your man, and lat him be theroute,°
And shet° the dore, whils° we been aboute
Our privetee,° that no man us espie
Whils that we werke in this philosophie.”

¶Al as he bad,° fulfilled was in dede,
This ilke servant anonright° out yede,°
And his maister shet the dore anon,
And to hir° labour speedily they gon.
This preeste, at this cursed chanons bidding,
Upon the fir anon sette this thing,
And blew the fir, and bisied him ful faste;
And this chanon into the croslet caste
A poudre, noot I° wherof that° it was
Ymaad,° outher of chalk outher° of glas,
Or somwhat° elles, was nat worth a flie,
To blinde with the preest; and bad him hie°
The coles for to couchen° al above
The croslet, “For, in tokning° I thee love,”
Quod this chanon, “thine owne hondes two
Shul werche al thing° which that shal heer be do.”°

¶“Graunt mercy,”° quod the preest, and was ful glad,
And couched° coles as the chanoun bad.
And while he bisy was, this feendly° wrecche,
This fals chanoun, the foule feend him fecche!°
Out of his bosom took a bechen cole,°
In which ful subtilly° was maad an hole,
And therin put was of silver lemaille°
An ounce, and stopped was, withouten faile,
The hool with wex, to keep the lemaille in.
And understondeth, that this false gin°
Was nat maad° ther, but it was maad bifore;
And other thinges I shal telle more
Herafterward, which that he with him broghte;
Er he cam there, him to bigile he thoghte,
And so he dide, er° that they wente atwinne;°
Til he had terved him,° coude he not blinne.°
It dulleth° me whan that I of him speke,
On his falshede fain° wolde I me wreke,°
If I wist° how; but he is heere and ther:
He is so variaunt,° he abit° nowher.

¶But taketh heed° now, sirs, for Goddes love!
He took his cole of which I spak above,
And in his hand he baar° it prively.°
And whils the preeste couched bisily°
The coles, as I tolde yow er this,
This chanon seide, “Freend, ye doon amis;°
This is nat couched° as it oghte be;
But sone I shal amenden° it,” quod he.
“Now lat me medle therwith° but a while,°
For of yow have I pitee, by Seint Gile!
Ye been right hoot, I see wel how ye swete,
Have heer a cloth, and wipe awey the wete.”°
And whiles that the preest him wiped his face,
This chanon took his col with harde grace,°
And leide it above, upon the middeward°
Of the croslet, and blew wel afterward,
Til that the coles gonne faste brenne.

¶“Now yeve us drinke,” quod the chanon thenne,
“As swithe° al shal be wel, I undertake;°
Sit we doun, and lat us mery make.”°
And whan that this chanones bechen° cole
Was brent, al the lemaille, out of the hole,
Into the croslet fil anon adoun;
And so it moste nedes,° by resoun,
Sin it so evene° above couched was;
But therof wist° the preest nothing, alas!
He demed alle the cols yliche° good,
For of that sleighte° he nothing understood.
And whan this alkamistre° saugh his time,
“Ris up,” quod he, “sir preest, and stondeth° by me;
And for I woot° wel ingot° have ye noon,
Goth, walketh forth, and bringe us a chalkstoon;°
For I wol make oon of the same shap
That is an ingot, if I may han hap.°
And bringeth eek with yow a bolle° or panne,
Ful of water, and ye shul see wel thanne
How that our bisinesse shal thrive° and preve.°
And yet, for° ye shul han no misbileve°
Ne wrong conceit° of me in your absence,
I ne wol nat been° out of your presence,
But go with yow, and com with yow agein.”
The chambre dore, shortly for to seyn,
They opened and shette, and wente hir weye.
And forth with hem they caryeden the keye,
And come again without any delay.
What° sholde I tary al the longe day?
He took the chalk, and shoop it in the wise°
Of an ingot, as I shal yow devise.°

¶I seye, he took out of his owne sleve,
A teine° of silver (evel mote he cheve!)
Which that ne was nat but° an ounce of weighte;
And taketh heed now of his cursed sleighte!
He shoop his ingot, in lengthe and eek in brede,°
Of this teine, withouten any drede,°
So slyly, that the preest it nat espide;°
And in his sleve again he gan it hide;
And fro the fir he took up his matere,°
And in th’ingot putte it with mirie chere,°
And in the water vessel he it caste
Whan that him luste,° and bad the preest as faste,°
“Look what ther is, put in thin hond and grope,°
Thow finde shalt ther silver, as I hope;°
What, devel of helle! shold it elles° be?
Shaving of silver silver is, pardee!”
He putte his hond in, and took up a teine
Of silver fin,° and glad in every veine
Was this preest, whan he saugh that it was so.
“Goddes blessing, and his modres also,
And alle halwes° have ye, sir chanoun,
Seid this preest, “and I hir malisoun,°
But, and ye vouchesauf° to techen me
This noble craft and this subtilitee,°
I wol be youre,° in al that evere I may!”

¶Quod the chanoun, “Yet wol I make assay°
The second time, that ye may taken hede
And been expert of° this, and in your need
Another day assaie in min absence
This discipline and this crafty° science.
Lat take° another ounce,” quod he tho,
“Of quiksilver, withouten wordes mo,°
And do therwith as ye han doon er this
With that other, which that now silver is.”

¶This preest him bisieth in al that he can
To doon as this chanon, this cursed man,
Comanded him, and faste° he blew the fir,
For to com to th’effect° of his desir.
And this chanon, right in the mene while,°
Al redy was, the preest eft° to bigile,
And, for a contenance,° in his hand he bar
An holwe° stikke (tak kepe° and be war!)
In the ende of which an ounce, and namore,
Of silver lemail° put was, as bifore
Was in his cole, and stopped with wex weel°
For to kepe in his lemail every deel.°
And whil this preest was in his bisinesse,°
This chanon with his stikke gan him dresse°
To him anon, and his poudre caste in
As he dide er° (the devel out of his skin
Him terve,° I pray to God, for his falshede;
For he was ever fals in thoght and dede);
And with this stikke, above the crosselet,
That was ordeined° with that false get,°
He stired the coles, til relente° gan
The wex again° the fir, as every man,
But° it a fool be, woot° wel it mot nede,°
And al that in the stikke was out yede,°
And in the croslet hastily it fel.

¶Now goode sirs, what wol ye bet than wel?°
Whan that this preest thus was bigiled agein,
Supposing° noght but treuthe, soth to seyn,
He was so glad, that I can nat expresse°
In no° manere his mirthe and his gladnesse;
And to the chanon he profred° eftsoone°
Body and good;° “ye,” quod the chanon soone,
“Though poure I be, crafty° thou shalt me finde;
I warne° thee, yet is ther moor bihinde.°
Is ther any coper herein?” seide he.
“Ye,” quod the preest, “sire, I trow° wel ther be.”
“Elles° go bye us som, and that as swithe,°
Now, goode sir, go forth thy wey and hy the.”°

¶He wente his wey, and with the coper cam,°
And this chanon it in his handes nam,°
And of that coper weied out but an ounce.

¶Al to simple° is my tong to pronounce,°
As ministre of my wit,° the doublenesse°
Of this chanoun, rote of al cursednesse.
He semed freendly to hem that knewe him noght,
But he was feendly° bothe in herte and thoght.
It werieth° me to telle of his falsnesse,
And nathelees yet wol I it expresse,°
To th’entente that° men may be war° therby,
And for noon other cause, trewely.

¶He putte the ounce of coper in the croslet,
And on the fir as swithe° he hath it set,
And caste in poudre, and maad the preest to blowe,
And in his werking for to stoupe° lowe,
As he dide er, and al nas but° a jape;°
Right as him list,° the preest he made his ape;°
And afterward in the ingot he it caste,
And in the panne putte it at the laste
Of water, and in he putte his owne hond.
And in his sleve (as ye biforenhond
Herde me telle) he hadde a silver teine.°
He slily tooke it out, this cursed heine°—
Unwiting this preest° of his false craft—
And in the pannes botme he hath it laft;
And in the water rombled to and fro,°
And wonder prively° took up also
The coper teine, noght knowing this preest,
And hidde it, and him hente° by the breest,
And to him spak, and thus seide in his game,°
“Stoupeth adoun, by God, ye be to blame,
Helpeth me now, as I did yow whil er,°
Putte in your hand, and looketh what is ther.”

¶This preest took up this silver teine anon,
And thanne seid the chanon, “Lat us gon
With thes three teines, which that we han wroght,
To som goldsmith, and wite° if they been oght.°
For, by my feith, I nolde,° for min hood,°
But if that° they were silver, fin and good,
And that as swithe preved it shal be.”

¶Unto the goldsmith with thes teines three
They wente, and put thes teines in assay°
To° fir and hamer; might no man sey nay,°
But that they weren as hem oghte be.

¶This sotted° preest, who was gladder than he?
Was never brid° gladder again° the day,
Ne° nightingale, in the sesoun of May,
Nas never noon° that luste bet° to singe;
Ne lady lustier° in caroling
Or for to speke of love and wommanhede,
Ne knight in arms to doon an hardy° dede
To stonde in grace° of his lady dere,
Than had this preest this sory° craft to lere;°
And to the chanoun thus he spak and seide,
“For love of God, that for us alle deide,
And as I may deserve it unto° yow,
What shal this receit° coste? telleth now!”

¶“By our lady,” quod this chanon, “it is dere,°
I warn yow wel; for, save° I and a frere,
In Engelond ther can no man it make.”
“No fors,”° quod he, “now, sir, for Goddes sake,
What shal I paye? telleth me, I preye.”
“Ywis,”° quod he, “it is ful deere, I seye;
Sire, at o word,° if that thee list it have,°
Ye shul pay fourty pound, so God me save!
And, ner° the freendship that ye dide er this
To me, ye sholde paye more, ywis.”

¶This preest the somme° of fourty pound anon
Of nobles fette,° and took hem everichon
To this chanoun, for this ilke receit;
Al his werking nas but° fraude and deceit.

¶“Sir preest,” he seide, “I kepe han no loos°
Of° my craft, for I wolde it kept wer cloos;°
And as ye love me, kepeth it secree;
For, and° men knewen al my subtiletee,
By God, they wolden han so greet envie
To° me, bicause of my philosophie,
I shuld be deed, ther wer non other weye.”
“God it forbed!” quod the preest, “What sey ye?”
Yet hadde I lever° spenden al the good
Which that I have (and elles° wexe I wood!°)
Than that ye sholden falle in swich mescheef.”°
“For your good wil, sir, have ye right good preef,”°
Quod the chanoun, “and farwel, grant mercy!”
He wente his wey and never the preest him sy°
After that day; and whan that this preest sholde
Maken assay,° at swich time as he wolde,°
Of this receit, farwel! it wold nat be!
Lo, thus bijaped° and bigiled was he!
Thus maketh he his introduccioun
To bringe folk to hir destruccioun.

¶Considereth, sirs, how that, in ech estaat,°
Bitwixe men and gold ther is debaat
So ferforth,° that unnethes° is ther noon.
This multiplying° blent° so many oon,
That in good feith I trowe that it be
The cause grettest of swich scarsetee.°
Philosophres speken so mistily°
In this craft, that men can nat com therby,°
For any wit that men han now adayes.
They mow wel° chiteren,° as that doon thes jayes,
And in her termes° sette hir lust and peine,°
But to hir purpos° shul they nevere atteine.
A man may lightly° lerne, if he have aught,°
To multiplie,° and bringe his good to naught!

¶Lo! swich a lucre° is in this lusty game,
A mannes mirthe it wol turne unto grame,°
And empten° also grete and hevy purses,
And maken folk for to purchacen° curses
Of hem,° that han hir good therto ylent.
O! fy! for shame! they that han been brent,°
Allas! can they nat flee the fires hete?°
Ye that it use, I rede° ye it lete,°
Lest ye lese al; for bet than nevere is late.°
Never to thrive wer to long a date.°
Though ye prolle° ay,° ye shul it never finde;
Ye been as bolde as is Bayard the blinde,
That blondreth° forth, and peril casteth noon;°
He is as bold to renne° again° a stoon
As for to goon besides° in the weye.
So faren ye° that multiplie, I seye.
If that youre eyen can nat seen aright,
Look that your minde lakke noght his sight.
For, though ye looken never so brode,° and stare,
Ye shul nat winne a mite° in that chaffare,°
But wasten al that ye may rape° and renne.°
Withdraw° the fir, lest it to faste brenne;
Medleth namoore with that art, I mene,
For, if ye doon, your thrift° is goon ful clene.°
And right as swithe° I wol yow tellen here,
What philosophres seyn in this matere.

¶Lo, thus seith Arnold of the Newe Toun,°
As his Rosarie maketh mencioun;
He seith right thus, withouten any lie:
“Ther may no man Mercurie mortifie,°
But° it be with his brother knowleching.°
How that he, which that first seid this thing,
Of philosophres fader was,° Hermes;
He seith, how that the dragoun,° doutelees,
Ne dyeth nat, but if that° he be slain
With his brother; and that is for to sayn,
By the dragon, Mercurie and noon other
He understood; and brimstoon° by his brother,
That out of sol and luna were ydrawe.
And therfor,” seide he, “tak heed to my sawe,°
Let no man bisy him° this art to seche,°
But if° that he th’entencioun and speche
Of philosophres understonde can;
And if he do, he is a lewed° man.
For this science and this conning,”° quod he,
“Is of the secree of secrees,° parde.”

¶Also ther was a disciple of Plato,
That on a time seide his maister to,
As his book Senior wol bere witnesse,
And this was his demande in soothfastnesse:°
“Tel me the name of the privy° stoon?”
And Plato answerde unto him anoon,
“Tak the stoon that Titanos° men name.”
“Which is that?” quod he. “Magnesia is the same,”
Seide Plato. “Ye, sire, and is it thus?
This is ignotum per ignotius.°
What is Magnesia, good sire, I yow preye?”
“It is a water that is maad, I seye,
Of elementes foure,” quod Plato.
“Tel me the rote,° good sir,” quod he tho,°
“Of that water, if that it be your wille?”
“Nay, nay,” quod Plato, “certein, that I nille.°
The philosophres sworn were everichoon,°
That they sholden discovere° it unto noon,°
Ne in no book it write in no manere;
For unto Crist it is so leef° and dere
That he wol nat that it discovered be,
But where it liketh° to his deitee°
Man for t’enspire,° and eek for to defende°
Whom that him liketh; lo, this is the ende.”

¶Than conclude I thus; sith° God of hevene
Ne wil nat° that the philosophres nevene°
How that a man shal come unto this stoon,
I rede,° as for the beste, lete it goon.
For whoso maketh God his adversarie,
As for to werken any thing in contrarie
Of his wil, certes, never shal he thrive,
Thogh that he multiplie terme of his live.°
And there a point;° for ended is my tale;
God send every trew man bote° of his bale!°—Amen.
