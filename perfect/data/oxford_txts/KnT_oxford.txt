¶Whilom,° as olde stories tellen us,
Ther was a duk that highte° Theseus;
Of Athenes he was lord and governour,
And in his time swich a conquerour,
That gretter was ther noon under the sonne.
Ful many a riche contree hadde he wonne;
What with his wisdom and his chivalrie,
He conquered al the regne° of Femenie,
That whilom was ycleped° Scithia;
And weddede the quene Ipolita,
And broghte hir hoom with him in his contree
With muchel glorie and greet solempnitee,
And eek hir yonge suster Emelie.

¶And thus with victorie and with melodie
Lete I this noble duk to Athenes ride,
And al his hoost, in armes, him biside.
And certes, if it nere° to long to here,
I wolde have told yow fully the manere,
How wonnen was the regne of Femenie
By Theseus, and by his chivalrie;
And of the grete bataille for the nones°
Bitwixen° Athenës and Amazones;
And how asseged was Ipolita,
The faire hardy quene of Scithia;
And of the feste that was at hir weddinge,
And of the tempest at hir hoomcominge;
But al that thing I moot as now forbere.°
I have, God woot,° a large feeld to ere,°
And waike° been the oxen in my plough.
The remenant of the tale is long ynough.°
I wol nat letten° eek noon of this route;°
Lat every felawe telle his tale aboute,
And lat see now who shal the soper° winne;
And ther° I lefte, I wol agein biginne.

¶This duk, of whom I make mencioun,
When he was come almost unto the toun,
In al his wele° and in his moste pride,
He was war, as he caste his eye aside,
Wher that ther kneled in the heighe weye
A companie of ladies, tweie and tweie,°
Ech after other, clad in clothes blake;
But swich a cry and swich a wo they make,
That in this world nis creature livinge,
That herde swich another weimentinge;°
And of this cry they nolde° never stenten,
Til they the reines of his bridel henten.°
“What folk ben ye, that at min hoomcominge
Perturben so my feste with cryinge?”
Quod Theseus, “Have ye so greet envie°
Of min honour, that thus compleine and crie?
Or who hath yow misboden,° or offended?
And telleth me if it may been amended,
And why that ye ben clothed thus in blak.”
The eldest lady of hem alle spak,
When° she hadde swowned° with a deedly chere,
That it was routhe for to seen and here,
And seide: “Lord, to whom Fortune hath yiven
Victorie, and as a conquerour to liven,
Noght greveth us your glorie and your honour;
But we biseken mercy and socour.
Have mercy on our wo and our distresse.
Som drope of pitee, thurgh thy gentillesse,°
Upon us wrecched wommen lat thou falle.
For certes, lord, ther nis noon of us alle,
That she nath been a duchesse or a quene;
Now be we caitifs,° as it is wel sene:
Thanked be Fortune, and hir false wheel
That noon estat° assureth to be weel.°
And certes, lord, to abiden your presence,
Here in the temple of the goddesse Clemence°
We han ben waitinge al this fourtenight;
Now help us, lord, sith it is in thy might.
I wrecche, which that wepe and waille thus,
Was whilom wif to king Capaneus,
That starf° at Thebes, cursed be that day!
And alle we, that been in this array,°
And maken al this lamentacioun,
We losten alle our housbondes at that toun,
Whil that the sege theraboute lay.
And yet now the olde Creon, weilaway!
That lord is now of Thebes the citee,
Fulfild of° ire and of iniquitee,
He, for despit,° and for his tirannie,
To do the dede bodies vileinie,°
Of alle our lordes, whiche that ben slawe,°
Hath all the bodies on an heep ydrawe,
And wol nat suffren hem, by noon assent,
Neither to been yburied nor ybrent,°
But maketh houndes ete hem in despit.”
And with that word, withouten more respit,°
They fillen gruf,° and criden pitously,
“Have on us wrecched wommen som mercy,
And lat our sorwe sinken in thin herte.”

¶This gentil duk doun from his courser° sterte
With herte pitous, whan he herde hem speke.
Him thoughte that his herte wolde breke,
Whan he saugh hem so pitous and so mat,°
That whilom weren of so greet estat.
And in his armes he hem alle up hente,°
And hem conforteth in ful good entente;
And swoor his ooth, as he was trewe knight,
He wolde doon so ferforthly his might
Upon the tyraunt Creon hem to wreke,°
That al the peple of Grece sholde speke
How Creon was of Theseus yserved,°
As he that hadde his deeth ful wel deserved.

¶And right anoon, withouten more abood,°
His baner he desplayeth, and forth rood
To Thebesward, and al his host° biside;
No neer° Athenës wolde he go ne ride,
Ne take his ese fully half a day,
But onward on his wey that night he lay;
And sente anoon Ipolita the quene,
And Emelie hir yonge suster shene,°
Unto the toun of Athenës to dwelle;
And forth he rit;° ther nis namore to telle.

¶The rede statue° of Mars, with spere and targe,°
So shineth in his white baner large,
That alle the feeldes° gliteren up and doun;
And by his baner born is his penoun°
Of gold ful riche, in which ther was ybete°
The Minotaur, which that he slough° in Crete.
Thus rit this duk, thus rit this conquerour,
And in his host of chivalrie the flour,
Til that he cam to Thebes, and alighte
Faire in a feeld, ther as he thoghte fighte.
But shortly for to speken of this thing,
With Creon, which that was of Thebes king,
He faught, and slough him manly as a knight
In plein bataille, and put the folk to flight;
And by assaut he wan the citee after,
And rente° adoun both wal, and sparre,° and rafter;
And to the ladies he restored again
The bones of hir housbondes that were slain,
To doon obsequies, as was tho the gise.

¶But it were al to long for to devise°
The grete clamour and the waimentinge°
That the ladies made at the brenninge°
Of the bodies, and the grete honour
That Theseus, the noble conquerour,
Doth to the ladies, whan they from him wente;
But shortly for to telle is min entente.
Whan that this worthy duk, this Theseus,
Hath Creon slain, and wonne Thebes thus,
Stille in that feeld he took al night his reste,
And dide with al the contree° as him leste.°
To ransake° in the tas° of bodies dede,
Hem for to strepe° of harneis° and of wede,°
The pilours° diden bisinesse and cure,
After the bataille and disconfiture.°

¶And so bifel that in the tas they founde,
Thurghgirt° with many a grevous blody wounde,
Two yonge knightes ligging by and by,°
Bothe in oon° armes, wroght ful richely,
Of whiche two, Arcita hight° that oon,
And that other knight hight Palamon.
Nat fully quike,° ne fully dede they were,
But by hir cote armures, and by hir gere,°
The heraudes° knewe hem best in special,
As they that weren of the blood royal
Of Thebes, and of sustren° two yborn.
Out of the tas° the pilours han hem torn,°
And han hem caried softe unto the tente
Of Theseus, and he ful sone hem sente
To Athenës, to dwellen in prisoun
Perpetuelly, he nolde no raunsoun.°

¶And whan this worthy duk hath thus ydon,
He took his host, and hoom he rood anon
With laurer° crowned as a conquerour;
And there he liveth, in joye and in honour,
Terme of his lif; what nedeth wordes mo?
And in a tour, in angwish and in wo,
Dwellen this Palamoun and eek Arcite,
For evermore, ther may no gold hem quite.°

¶This passeth yeer by yeer, and day by day,
Til it fil ones, in a morwe of May,
That Emelie, that fairer was to sene
Than is the lilie upon his stalke grene,
And fressher than the May with floures newe—
For with the rose colour stroof° hir hewe,
I noot° which was the fairer of hem two—
Er it were day, as was hir wone° to do,
She was arisen, and al redy dight;°
For May wol have no slogardie° anight.
The sesoun priketh° every gentil° herte,
And maketh him out of his sleep to sterte,°
And seith, “Aris, and do thin observaunce.”
This maked Emelie have remembraunce
To doon honour to May, and for to rise.
Yclothed was she fresh, for to devise;
Hir yelow heer was broided° in a tresse,
Bihinde hir bak, a yerde long, I gesse.
And in the gardin, at the sonne upriste,°
She walketh up and doun, and as hir liste°
She gadereth floures, party° white and rede,
To make a sotil gerland for hir hede,
And as an aungel hevenisshly she song.

¶The grete tour, that was so thikke and strong,
Which of the castel was the chief dongeoun,°
Theras the knightes weren in prisoun,
Of whiche I tolde yow, and tellen shal
Was evene joinant to° the gardin wal,
Ther as this Emelie hadde hir pleyinge.
Bright was the sonne, and cleer in that morweninge,
And Palamon, this woful prisoner,
As was his wone,° by leve of his gailer,
Was risen, and romed in a chambre on heigh,
In which he al the noble citee seigh,°
And eek the gardin, ful of braunches grene,
Theras this fresshe Emelie the shene
Was in hir walk, and romed up and doun.
This sorweful prisoner, this Palamoun,
Goth in the chambre, roming to and fro,
And to himself compleining of his wo;
That he was born, ful ofte he seide, “Alas!”

¶And so bifel by aventure or cas,°
That thurgh a window, thikke of many a barre
Of yren greet, and square as any sparre,°
He caste his eye upon Emelia,
And therwithal he bleinte,° and cride “A!”
As though he stongen° were unto the herte.

¶And with that cry Arcite anon upsterte,°
And seide, “Cosin min, what eileth thee,
That art so pale and deedly on to see?
Why crydestow? who hath thee doon offence?
For Goddes love, tak al in pacience
Our prisoun, for it may non other be;
Fortune hath yeven° us this adversitee.
Som wikke aspect° or disposicioun
Of Saturne, by sum constellacioun,°
Hath yeven us this, although we hadde it sworn;°
So stood the hevene whan that we were born;
We moste endure it: this is the short and plein.”

¶This Palamon answerde, and seide agein,
“Cosin, for sothe,° of this opinioun
Thou hast a vein imaginacioun.°
This prison caused me nat for to crye.
But I was hurt right now thurghout min yë°
Into min herte, that wol my bane° be.
The fairnesse of that lady that I see
Yond in the gardin romen to and fro,
Is cause of al my crying and my wo.
I noot° wher she be womman or goddesse;
But Venus is it, soothly, as I gesse.”
And therwithal on kneës doun he fil,°
And seide: “Venus, if it be thy wil
Yow in this gardin thus to transfigure
Bifore me, sorweful wrecche creature,
Out of this prisoun help that we may scapen.°
And if so be my destinee be shapen
By eterne word to dien in prisoun,
Of our linage have som compassioun,
That is so lowe ybroght by tirannie.”

¶And with that word Arcite gan espie
Wheras this lady romed to and fro.
And with that sighte hir beautee hurte him so,
That, if that Palamon was wounded sore,
Arcite is hurt as muche as he, or more.
And with a sigh he seide pitously:
“The fresshe beautee sleeth° me sodeinly
Of hir that rometh in the yonder place;
And, but° I have hir mercy and hir grace,
That I may seen hir atte leeste weye,°
I nam° but deed; ther nis° namore to seye.”

¶This Palamon, whan he tho° wordes herde,
Dispitously° he loked, and answerde:
“Whether seistow° this in ernest or in pley?”
“Nay,” quod Arcite, “in ernest, by my fey!
God help me so, me list ful ivel° pleye.”
This Palamon gan knitte his browes tweie:°
“It nere,” quod he, “to thee no greet honour
For to be fals, ne for to be traitour
To me, that am thy cosin and thy brother
Ysworn ful depe, and ech of us til° other,
That never, for to dien in the peine,
Til that the deeth departe shal us tweine,
Neither of us in love to hindren other,
Ne in non other cas,° my leve° brother;
But that thou sholdest trewely forthren° me
In every cas, and I shal forthren thee.
This was thin ooth, and min also, certein;
I wot° right wel thou darst° it nat withseyn.°
Thus artow° of my counseil, out of doute.
And now thou woldest falsly been aboute
To love my lady, whom I love and serve,
And ever shal, til that min herte sterve.°
Now certes, fals Arcite, thou shalt nat so.
I loved hir first, and tolde thee my wo
As to my counseil,° and my brother sworn
To forthre me, as I have told biforn.
For which thou art ybounden as a knight
To helpen me, if it lay in thy might,
Or elles artow fals, I dar wel seyn.”

¶This Arcitë ful proudly spak agein,°
“Thou shalt,” quod he, “be rather fals than I;
But thou art fals, I tell thee utterly;
For par amour° I loved hir first er thow.
What wiltow° seyn? thou wistest° nat yet now
Whether she be a womman or goddesse!
Thin is affeccioun° of holinesse,
And min is love, as to a creature;°
For which I tolde thee min aventure
As to my cosin, and my brother sworn.
I pose,° that thou lovedest hir biforn;
Wostow nat wel the olde clerkes sawe,°
That ‘who shal yeve a lover any lawe?’
Love is a gretter lawe, by my pan,°
Than may be yeve° to any erthly man.
And therfor positif lawe° and swich decree
Is broke alday for love, in ech degree.
A man moot nedes° love, maugree his heed.°
He may nat fleen it, thogh he sholde be deed,
Al be she maide, or widwe, or elles wif.
And eek it is nat likly, al thy lif,
To stonden in hir grace; namore shal I;
For wel thou woost thyselven, verraily,
That thou and I be dampned to prisoun
Perpetuelly; us gaineth no raunsoun.
We strive as dide the houndes for the boon,
They foughte al day, and yet hir part° was noon;
Ther cam a kite,° whil that they were wrothe,
And bar° awey the boon° bitwixe° hem bothe.
And therfore, at the kinges court, my brother,
Ech man for himself, ther is non other.
Love if thee list;° for I love and ay shal;
And soothly,° leve brother, this is al.
Here in this prisoun mote° we endure,
And everich° of us take his aventure.”°
Greet was the strif and long bitwixe hem tweie,
If that I hadde leiser° for to seye;

¶But to th’effect.° It happed on a day,
(To telle it yow as shortly as I may)
A worthy duk that highte° Perotheus,
That felawe was unto duk Theseus
Sin thilke° day that they were children lite,°
Was come to Athenes, his felawe to visite,
And for to pleye, as he was wont to do,
For in this world he loved no man so:
And he loved him as tendrely agein.
So wel they loved, as olde bokes seyn,
That whan that oon was deed, sothly to telle,
His felawe wente and soghte him doun in helle;
But of that story list me nat° to write.
Duk Perotheus loved wel Arcite,
And hadde him knowe at Thebes yeer by yere;
And finally, at requeste and preiere
Of Perotheus, withoute any raunsoun,°
Duk Theseus him leet out of prisoun,
Freely to goon, wher that him liste overal,
In swich a gise,° as I you tellen shal.
This was the forward,° pleinly for t’endite,°
Bitwixen° Theseus and him Arcite:
That if so were,° that Arcite were yfounde
Ever in his lif, by day or night or stounde,°
In any contree of this Theseus,
And he were caught, it was acorded thus,
That with a swerd he sholde lese his heed;
Ther nas non other remedie ne reed,°
But taketh his leve, and homward he him spedde;
Let him be war, his nekke lith to wedde!°

¶How greet a sorwe suffreth now Arcite!
The deeth he feleth thurgh his herte smite;°
He wepeth, waileth, cryeth pitously;
To sleen himself he waiteth° prively.
He seide, “Allas that day that I was born!
Now is my prison worse than biforn;
Now is me shape° eternally to dwelle
Noght in my purgatorie, but in helle.
Allas! that ever knew I Perotheus!
For elles hadde I dwelled with Theseus
Yfetered in his prisoun evermo.
Than hadde I been in blisse, and nat in wo.
Only the sighte of hir, whom that I serve,
Though that I never hir grace may deserve,
Wolde han suffised° right ynough° for me.

¶“O dere cosin Palamon,” quod he,
“Thin is the victorie of this aventure,
Ful blisfully in prison maistow dure;°
In prison? certes nay, but in paradis!
Wel hath fortune yturned thee the dis,°
That hast the sighte of hir, and I th’absence.
For possible is, sin° thou hast hir presence,
And art a knight, a worthy and an able,
That by som cas, sin fortune is chaungeable,
Thou mayst to thy desir som time atteine.
But I, that am exiled, and bareine°
Of alle grace, and in so greet despeir,
That ther nis erthe, water, fir, ne eir,
Ne creature, that of hem maked is,
That may me heele° or doon confort in this.
Wel oughte I sterve° in wanhope° and distresse;
Farwel my lif, my lust,° and my gladnesse!

¶“Allas, why pleinen° folk so in commune
Of purveiaunce° of God, or of fortune,
That yeveth° hem ful ofte in many a gise°
Wel bettre than they can hemself devise?°
Som man desireth for to han richesse,
That cause is of his mordre° or greet siknesse.
And som man wolde° out of his prison fain,°
That in his hous is of his meinee slain.°
Infinite harmes been in this matere;
We witen° nat what thing we preyen here.
We faren° as he that dronke is as a mous;
A dronke man wot° wel he hath an hous,
But he noot° which the righte wey is thider;
And to a dronke man the wey is slider.°
And certes, in this world so faren we;
We seken faste after felicitee,
But we goon wrong ful often, trewely.
Thus may we seyen alle, and namely° I,
That wende° and hadde a greet opinioun,°
That, if I mighte escapen from prisoun,
Than hadde I been in joye and perfit hele,°
Ther now I am exiled fro my wele.°
Sin° that I may nat seen yow, Emelie,
I nam but deed; ther nis no remedie.”

¶Upon that other side Palamon,
Whan that he wiste° Arcite was agon,
Swich sorwe he maketh, that the grete tour
Resouneth° of his youling° and clamour.
The pure° fettres on his shines° grete°
Weren of his bittre salte teres wete.
“Allas!” quod he, “Arcita, cosin min,
Of al our strif, God woot, the fruit° is thin.
Thow walkest now in Thebes at thy large,°
And of my wo thou yevest litel charge.°
Thou mayst, sin thou hast wisdom and manhede,
Assemblen al the folk of our kinrede,
And make a werre so sharp on this citee,
That by som aventure, or som tretee,°
Thou mayst have hir to lady and to wif,
For whom that I mot nedes° lese my lif.
For, as by wey of possibilitee,
Sith thou art at thy large, of prison free,
And art a lord, greet is thin avauntage,
More than is min, that sterve° here in a cage.
For I mot wepe and waile, whil I live,
With al the wo that prison may me yive,
And eek with peine that love me yiveth also,
That doubleth al my torment and my wo.”

¶Therwith the fir of jelousie upsterte°
Withinne his brest, and hente° him by the herte
So woodly,° that he lik was to biholde
The box tree, or the asshen° dede and colde.

¶Tho seide he; “O cruel goddes, that governe
This world with binding of your word eterne,
And writen in the table of athamaunt°
Your parlement,° and your eterne graunt,°
What is mankinde more unto yow holde°
Than is the sheep, that rouketh° in the folde?
For slain is man right as another beste,
And dwelleth eek in prison and areste,
And hath siknesse, and greet adversitee,
And ofte times giltelees, pardee!°
What governaunce° is in this prescience,°
That giltelees tormenteth innocence?
And yet encreseth this al my penaunce,°
That man is bounden to his observaunce,°
For Goddes sake, to letten of° his wille,
Ther as° a beest may al his lust° fulfille.
And whan a beest is deed, he hath no peine;
But man after his deeth moot° wepe and pleine,°
Though in this world he have care and wo:
Withouten doute it may stonden so.
The answere of this I lete° to divinis,°
But wel I woot, that in this world gret pine° is.
Allas! I see a serpent or a theef,
That many a trewe man hath doon mescheef,°
Goon at his large,° and wher him list° may turne.
But I mot been in prison thurgh Saturne,
And eek thurgh Juno, jalous and eek wood,°
That hath destroyed wel ny al° the blood
Of Thebes, with his waste° walles wide.
And Venus sleeth° me on that other side
For jelousie, and fere° of him Arcite.”

¶Now wol I stinte° of Palamon a lite,°
And lete° him in his prison stille dwelle,
And of Arcita forth I wol yow telle.
The somer passeth, and the nightes longe
Encresen double wise the peines stronge
Bothe of the lovere and the prisoner.
I noot° which hath the wofullere mester.°
For shortly for to seyn, this Palamoun
Perpetuelly is dampned to prisoun,
In cheines and in fettres to ben deed;
And Arcite is exiled upon his heed°
For evermo as out of that contree,
Ne never mo he shal his lady see.
Yow loveres axe° I now this questioun,
Who hath the worse, Arcite or Palamoun?
That oon may seen his lady day by day,
But in prison he moot dwelle alway.
That other wher him list may ride or go,
But seen his lady shal he never mo.
Now demeth° as yow liste, ye that can,
For I wol telle forth as I bigan.

¶Whan that Arcite to Thebes comen was,
Ful ofte a day he swelte° and seide “Allas,”
For seen his lady shal he never mo.
And shortly to concluden al his wo,
So muche sorwe had never creature
That is, or shal, whil that the world may dure.°
His sleep, his mete,° his drink is him biraft,°
That lene° he wex,° and drie as is a shaft.°
His eyen° holwe, and grisly° to biholde;
His hewe falwe,° and pale as asshen colde,
And solitarie he was, and ever allone,
And wailling al the night, making his mone.°
And if he herde song or instrument,
Then wolde he wepe, he mighte nat be stent;°
So feble eek were his spirits, and so lowe,
And chaunged so, that no man coude knowe
His speche nor his vois, though men it herde.
And in his gere,° for al the world he ferde°
Nat oonly lik the loveres maladie°
Of Hereos, but rather lik Manie°
Engendred of humour malencolik,°
Biforen, in his celle fantastik.°
And shortly, turned was al up so doun
Bothe habit and eek disposicioun°
Of him, this woful lovere daun° Arcite.

¶What sholde I al day of his wo endite?°
Whan he endured hadde a yeer or two
This cruel torment, and this peine and wo,
At Thebes, in his contree, as I seide,
Upon a night, in sleep as he him leide,
Him thoughte how that the winged god Mercurie
Biforn him stood, and bad him to be murie.°
His slepy yerde° in hond he bar uprighte;
An hat he werede° upon his heres brighte.
Arrayed was this god (as he took keep°)
As he was whan that Argus took his sleep;
And seide him thus: “To Athenes shaltou wende;°
Ther is thee shapen° of thy wo an ende.”

¶And with that word Arcite wook and sterte.°
“Now trewely, how° sore that me smerte,”°
Quod he, “to Athenes right now wol I fare;°
Ne for the drede of deeth shal I nat spare
To see my lady, that I love and serve;
In hir presence I recche nat to sterve.”°

¶And with that word he caughte a greet mirour,
And saugh that chaunged was al his colour,
And saugh his visage al in another kinde.
And right anoon it ran him° in his minde,
That, sith his face was so disfigured
Of maladie, the which he hadde endured,
He mighte wel, if that he bar him lowe,°
Live in Athenes ever more unknowe,
And seen his lady wel ny day by day.
And right anon he chaunged his array,°
And cladde him as a povre laborer,
And al allone, save oonly a squier,
That knew his privetee° and al his cas,
Which was disgised povrely, as he was,
To Athenes is he goon the nexte° way.
And to the court he wente upon a day,
And at the gate he profreth his servise,
To drugge and drawe,° what so men wol devise.°

¶And shortly of this matere for to seyn,
He fil in office with a chamberlein,°
The which that dwelling was with Emelie.
For he was wis, and coude soon aspie
Of every servaunt, which that serveth here.
Wel coude he hewen° wode, and water bere,
For he was yong and mighty for the nones,°
And therto he was strong and big of bones
To doon that any wight° can him devise.°
A yeer or two he was in this servise,
Page of the chambre of Emelie the brighte;
And “Philostrate” he seide that he highte.°
But half so wel biloved a man as he
Ne was ther never in court, of his degree;
He was so gentil of condicioun,
That thurghout al the court was his renoun.°
They seiden, that it were a charitee°
That Theseus wolde enhauncen his degree,°
And putten him in worshipful° servise,
Ther as he mighte his vertu° excercise.

¶And thus, withinne a while, his name is spronge°
Bothe of his dedes, and his goode tonge,
That Theseus hath taken him so neer
That of his chambre he made him a squier,°
And yaf° him gold to maintene his degree;
And eek men broghte him out of his contree
From yeer to yeer, ful prively, his rente;°
But honestly° and slyly° he it spente,
That no man wondred how that he it hadde.
And three yeer in this wise his lif he ladde,
And bar him so in pees and eek in werre,
Ther nas no man that Theseus hath derre.°

¶And in this blisse lete° I now Arcite,
And speke I wol of Palamon a lite.°
In derknesse and horrible and strong prisoun
This seven yeer hath seten Palamoun,
Forpined,° what for° wo and for distresse;
Who feleth double soor and hevinesse
But Palamon? that love destreineth° so,
That wood° out of his wit he gooth for wo;
And eek therto he is a prisoner
Perpetuelly, noght oonly for a yeer.
Who coude rime in English proprely
His martyrdom?° for sothe,° it am nat I;
Therefore I passe as lightly as I may.
It fel° that in the seventhe yeer, in May,
The thridde° night (as olde bokes seyn,
That al this storie tellen more plein),
Were it by aventure° or destinee,
(As, whan a thing is shapen, it shal be),
That, sone after the midnight, Palamoun,
By helping of a freend, brak his prisoun,
And fleeth the citee, faste as he may go;
For he had yive his gailer° drinke so
Of a clarree,° maad of a certein win,
With nercotikes° and opie° of Thebes fin,
That al that night, thogh that° men wolde him shake,
The gailer sleep, he mighte nat awake;
And thus he fleeth as faste as ever he may.
The night was short, and faste by° the day,
That nedescost° he moste himselven hide,
And til° a grove, faste° ther beside,
With dredful° foot than stalketh Palamoun.
For shortly, this was his opinioun,
That in that grove he wolde him hide al day,
And in the night than wolde he take his way
To Thebesward, his freendes for to preie
On Theseus to helpe him to werreie,°
And shortly,° outher° he wolde lese his lif,
Or winnen Emelie unto his wif;
This is th’effect and his entente plein.

¶Now wol I torne unto Arcite agein,
That litel wiste° how ny° that was his care,°
Til that fortune had broght him in the snare.
The bisy larke, messager of day,
Saluëth° in hir song the morwe gray;°
And firy Phebus° riseth up so brighte,
That al the orient° laugheth of the lighte,
And with his stremes drieth in the greves°
The silver dropes, hanging on the leves.°
And Arcite, that is in the court royal
With Theseus, his squier principal,
Is risen, and loketh on the mirie day.
And, for to doon his observaunce to May,
Remembring on the point of his desir,
He on a courser,° sterting° as the fir,
Is riden into the feeldes, him to pleye,
Out of the court, were it° a mile or tweie;°
And to the grove, of which that I yow tolde,
By aventure, his wey he gan to holde,°
To maken him a gerland of the greves,°
Were it of wodebinde or hawethorn leves,°
And loude he song agein° the sonne shene:°
“May, with alle thy floures and thy grene,
Welcome be thou, faire fresshe May,
I hope that I som grene gete may.”
And from his courser, with a lusty° herte,
Into the grove ful hastily he sterte,°
And in a path he rometh up and doun,
Theras, by aventure, this Palamoun
Was in a bush, that no man mighte him see,
For sore afered° of his deeth was he.
Nothing ne knew he that it was Arcite:
God wot° he wolde have trowed° it ful lite.°

¶But sooth is seid, gon sithen many yeres,°
That “feeld hath eyen,° and the wode hath eres.”
It is ful fair a man to bere him evene,°
For alday meteth° men at unset stevene.°
Ful litel woot Arcite of his felawe,
That was so ny to herknen° al his sawe,°
For in the bush he sitteth now ful stille.
Whan that Arcite had romed al his fille,
And songen al the roundel lustily,°
Into a studie° he fil° al sodeinly,
As doon thise loveres in hir queinte geres,°
Now in the croppe,° now doun in the breres,°
Now up, now doun, as boket° in a welle.
Right as the Friday, soothly for to telle,
Now it shineth, now it reineth faste,
Right so can gery° Venus overcaste
The hertes of hir folk; right as hir day
Is gerful, right so chaungeth she array.°
Selde° is the Friday al the wike° ylike.°
Whan that Arcite had songe, he gan to sike,°
And sette him doun withouten any more:°
“Alas!” quod he, “that day that I was bore!°
How longe, Juno, thurgh thy crueltee,
Woltow werreien° Thebes the citee?
Allas! ybroght is to confusioun
The blood royal of Cadme and Amphioun;
Of Cadmus, which that was the firste man
That Thebes bulte,° or first the toun bigan,
And of the citee first was crouned king,
Of his linage am I, and his ofspring
By verray ligne, as of the stok royal:
And now I am so caitif° and so thral,
That he, that is my mortal enemy,
I serve him as his squier povrely.°
And yet doth Juno me wel more shame,
For I dar noght biknowe° min owen name;
But theras I was wont to highte° Arcite,
Now highte I Philostrate, noght worth a mite.°
Allas! thou felle° Mars, allas! Juno,
Thus hath your ire° our kinrede° al fordo,°
Save only me, and wrecched Palamoun,
That Theseus martyreth° in prisoun.
And over° al this, to sleen me utterly,
Love hath his firy dart so brenningly°
Ystiked° thurgh my trewe° careful° herte,
That shapen was my deeth erst than my sherte.°
Ye sleen me with your eyen,° Emelie;
Ye been the cause wherfor° that I die.
Of al the remenant of min other care
Ne sette I nat the mountaunce of a tare,°
So that I coude° don aught to your plesaunce!”
And with that word he fil doun in a traunce
A longe time; and after he up sterte.

¶This Palamoun, that thought that thurgh his herte
He felte a cold swerd sodeinliche glide,
For ire° he quook, no lenger wolde he bide.
And whan that he had herd Arcites tale,
As he were wood,° with face deed and pale,
He sterte him up out of the buskes° thikke,
And seide: “Arcite, false traitour wikke,°
Now artow hent,° that lovest my lady so,
For whom that I have al this peine and wo,
And art my blood, and to my counseil sworn,°
As I ful ofte have told thee heerbiforn,
And hast bijaped° here duk Theseus,
And falsly chaunged hast thy name thus;
I wol be deed, or elles thou shalt die.
Thou shalt nat love my lady Emelie,
But I wol love hir only, and namo;°
For I am Palamoun, thy mortal fo.
And though that° I no wepne have in this place,
But out of prison am astert° by grace,
I drede noght that outher° thou shalt die,
Or thou ne shalt nat loven Emelie.
Chees which thou wilt, for thou shalt nat asterte.”°

¶This Arcitë, with ful despitous° herte,
Whan he him knew, and hadde his tale herd,
As fiers as leoun, pulled out his swerd,
And seide thus: “By God that sit above,
Nere it that° thou art sik, and wood for love,
And eek° that thou no wepne hast in this place,
Thou sholdest never out of this grove pace,
That thou ne sholdest dyen of min hond.
For I defie° the seurtee° and the bond
Which that thou seyst that I have maad to thee.
What, verray fool, think wel that love is free,°
And I wol love hir, maugre° al thy might!
But, for as muche thou art a worthy knight,
And wilnest to darreine hir by bataile,
Have heer my trouthe,° tomorwe I wol nat faile,
Withouten witing° of any other wight,°
That here I wol be founden as° a knight,
And bringen harneis° right ynough for thee;
And chees the beste, and leve the worste for me.
And mete° and drinke this night wol I bringe
Ynough° for thee, and clothes for thy beddinge.
And, if so be that thou my lady winne,
And slee me in this wode ther I am inne,
Thou mayst wel have thy lady, as for me.”°

¶This Palamon answerde: “I graunte it thee.”
And thus they been departed til amorwe,°
When ech of hem had leid his feith to borwe.°
O Cupide, out of alle charitee!
O regne,° that wolt no felawe have with thee!
Ful sooth is seid, that love ne lordshipe
Wol noght, his thankes,° have no felaweshipe;
Wel finden that Arcite and Palamoun.

¶Arcite is riden anon° unto the toun,
And on the morwe, er it were dayes light,
Ful prively two harneis hath he dight,°
Bothe suffisaunt and mete° to darreine°
The bataille in the feeld bitwix hem tweine.
And on his hors, allone as he was born,
He carieth al this harneis him biforn;
And in the grove, at time and place yset,
This Arcite and this Palamon ben met.

¶Tho chaungen gan the colour in hir face;
Right as the hunters in the regne of Trace,°
That stonden at the gappe with a spere,
Whan hunted is the leoun or the bere,°
And hereth him come russhing in the greves,°
And breketh bothe bowes° and the leves,
And thinketh, “Heer cometh my mortal enemy,
Withoute faile, he moot° be deed, or I;
For outher° I mot sleen° him at the gappe,°
Or he mot sleen me, if that me mishappe.”°
So ferden they,° in chaunging of hir hewe,°
As fer as everich of hem other knewe.
Ther nas no good day, ne no saluing;°
But streight, withouten word or rehersing,°
Everich° of hem halp° for to armen other,
As freendly as he were his owne brother;
And after that, with sharpe speres stronge
They foinen° ech at other wonder longe.
Thou mightest wene° that this Palamoun
In his fighting were as a wood° leoun,
And as a cruel tigre° was Arcite:
As wilde bores° gonne they to smite,°
That frothen° white as foom for ire wood.°
Up to the ancle° foghte they in hir blood.

¶And in this wise I lete hem fighting dwelle;
And forth I wol of Theseus yow telle.
The destinee, ministre general,
That executeth° in the world overal
The purveiaunce,° that God hath seyn biforn,°
So strong it is, that, though the world had sworn
The contrarie of a thing, by ye or nay,
Yet somtime it shal fallen on a day
That falleth nat eft° withinne a thousand yere.
For certeinly, our appetites° here,
Be it of werre, or pees, or hate, or love,
Al is this reuled° by the sighte° above.
This mene I now by mighty Theseus,
That for to honten° is so desirous,
And namely° at the grete hert° in May,
That in his bed ther daweth° him no day,
That he nis clad,° and redy for to ride
With hunte° and horn, and houndes him biside.
For in his hunting hath he swich delit,
That it is al his joye and appetit
To been himself the grete hertes bane;°
For after Mars he serveth now Diane.
Cleer was the day, as I have told er° this,
And Theseus, with alle joye and blis,
With his Ipolita, the faire quene,
And Emelie, clothed al in grene,
On hunting be they riden royally.
And to the grove, that stood ful faste by,°
In which ther was an hert,° as men him tolde,
Duk Theseus the streighte° wey hath holde.°
And to the launde° he rideth him ful right,°
For thider was the hert wont° have his flight,
And over a brook, and so forth on his weye.
This duk wol han a cours° at him, or tweie,
With houndes, swiche as that him list° comaunde.

¶And whan this duk was come unto the launde,
Under the sonne° he loketh, and anon°
He was war of Arcite and Palamon,
That foughten breme,° as it were bores two;
The brighte swerdes wenten to and fro
So hidously, that with the leeste strook
It seemed as it wolde felle° an ook;
But what° they were, no thing he ne woot.°
This duk his courser with his spores° smoot,°
And at a stert° he was bitwix hem two,
And pulled out a swerd and cried, “Ho!
Namore, up peine of lesing° of your heed!
By mighty Mars, he shal anon be deed,
That smiteth any strook, that I may seen!
But telleth me what mister° men ye been,
That been so hardy° for to fighten here
Withouten juge or other officere,
As it were in a listes° royally?”

¶This Palamon answerde hastily,
And seide: “Sire, what nedeth wordes mo?
We have the deeth deserved bothe two.
Two woful wrecches been we, two caitives,°
That been encombred of° our owne lives;
And as thou art a rightful lord and juge,
Ne yeve us neither mercy ne refuge,
But slee me first, for seinte charitee;°
But slee my felawe eek° as wel as me.
Or slee him first; for, though thou knowest it lite,°
This is thy mortal fo, this is Arcite,
That fro thy lond is banished on his heed,°
For which he hath deserved to be deed.
For this is he that cam unto thy gate,
And seide, that he highte Philostrate.
Thus hath he japed° thee ful many a yeer,
And thou hast maked him thy chief squier;
And this is he that loveth Emelie.
For sith the day is come that I shal die,
I make pleinly my confessioun,
That I am thilke° woful Palamoun,
That hath thy prison broken wikkedly.°
I am thy mortal fo, and it am I
That loveth so hote Emelie the brighte,
That I wol die present° in hir sighte.
Therfore I axe deeth and my juwise°
But slee my felawe in the same wise,
For bothe han we deserved to be slain.”

¶This worthy duk answerde anon again,
And seide, “This is a short conclusioun:
Youre owne mouth, by your confessioun,
Hath dampned you, and I wol it recorde,°
It nedeth noght to pine° yow with the corde.°
Ye shul be deed, by mighty Mars the rede!”
The quene anon, for verray wommanhede,
Gan for to wepe, and so dide Emelie,
And alle the ladies in the companie.
Gret pitee was it, as it thoughte hem alle,
That ever swich a chaunce sholde falle;°
For gentil men they were, of greet estat,
And no thing but for love was this debat;
And sawe hir blody woundes wide and sore;
And alle criden, bothe lasse and more,
“Have mercy, lord, upon us wommen alle!”
And on hir bare knees adoun they falle,
And wolde have kist his feet theras he stood,
Til at the laste aslaked° was his mood;
For pitee renneth sone in gentil° herte.
And though he first for ire quook and sterte,°
He hath considered shortly, in a clause,
The trespas of hem bothe, and eek the cause:
And although that his ire hir gilt accused,
Yet in his reson he hem bothe excused;
As thus: he thoghte wel that every man
Wol helpe himself in love, if that he can,
And eek° delivere himself out of prisoun;
And eek his herte had compassioun
Of wommen, for they wepen ever in oon;°
And in his gentil herte he thoghte anoon,
And softe unto himself he seide: “Fy
Upon a lord that wol have no mercy,
But been a leoun, bothe in word and dede,
To hem that been in repentaunce and drede
As wel as to a proud despitous° man
That wol mainteine that he first bigan!
That lord hath litel of discrecioun,
That in swich cas can no divisioun,
But weieth pride and humblesse after oon.”°

¶And shortly, whan his ire is thus agoon,
He gan to loken up with eyen lighte,°
And spak thise same wordes al on highte:°—
“The god of love, a! benedicite,
How mighty and how greet a lord is he!
Ayeins his might ther gaineth° none obstacles,
He may be cleped° a god for his miracles;
For he can maken at his owne gise°
Of everich herte, as that him list devise.°
Lo heer, this Arcite and this Palamoun,
That quitly° weren out of my prisoun,
And mighte han lived in Thebes royally,
And witen° I am hir mortal enemy,
And that hir deeth lith in my might° also,
And yet hath love, maugree hir eyen two,°
Ybroght hem hider° bothe for to die!
Now loketh, is nat that an heigh° folie?
Who may been a fool, but if he love?
Bihold, for Goddes sake that sit above,
Se how they blede! be they noght wel arraied?°
Thus hath hir lord, the god of love, ypaied°
Hir wages and hir fees for hir servise!
And yet they wenen° for to been ful wise
That serven love, for aught° that may bifalle!
But this is yet the beste game of alle,
That she, for whom they han this jolitee,°
Can° hem therfor as muche thank as me;
She woot° namore of al this hote fare,°
By God, than woot a cokkow° or an hare!
But al mot° been assayed,° hoot and cold;
A man mot been a fool, or yong or old;
I woot it by myself ful yore agoon:°
For in my time a servant was I oon.
And therfore, sin I knowe of loves peine,
And woot how sore° it can a man distreine,°
As he that hath ben caught ofte in his las,°
I yow foryeve° al hoolly this trespas,
At requeste of the quene that kneleth here,
And eek of Emelie, my suster dere.
And° ye shul bothe anon unto me swere,
That never mo ye shul my contree dere,°
Ne make werre upon me night ne day,
But been my freendes in al that ye may,
I yow foryeve this trespas every del.”°

¶And they him swore his axing° faire and wel
And him of lordshipe° and of mercy preide,
And he hem graunteth grace, and thus he seide:
“To speke of royal linage and richesse,
Though that° she were a quene or a princesse,
Ech of yow bothe is worthy, doutelees,
To wedden whan time is, but nathelees
I speke as for my suster Emelie,
For whom ye have this strif and jalousie;
Ye woot yourself, she may not wedden two
At ones, though ye fighten ever mo:
That oon of yow, al be him looth or leef,°
He moot go pipen° in an ivy leef;
This is to seyn, she may nat now han bothe,
Al be° ye never so jelous, ne so wrothe.
And forthy I yow putte in this degree,°
That ech of yow shal have his destinee
As him is shape;° and herkneth° in what wise;
Lo, heer your ende of that I shal devise.
My wil is this, for plat° conclusioun,
Withouten any replicacioun,°
If that yow liketh,° tak it for the beste,
That everich of yow shal gon wher him leste°
Frely, withouten raunson or daunger;°
And this day fifty wikes, fer ne ner,°
Everich of yow shal bringe an hundred knightes,
Armed for listes° up at alle rightes,°
Al redy to darreine hir° by bataille.
And this bihote° I yow, withouten faille,
Upon my trouthe,° and as I am a knight,
That whether° of yow bothe that hath might,
This is to seyn, that whether he or thou
May with his hundred, as I spak of now,
Sleen his contrarie,° or out of listes drive,
Him shal I yeve Emelia to wive,°
To whom that fortune yeveth so fair a grace.
The listes shal I maken in this place,
And God so wisly on my soule rewe,°
As I shal even° juge been and trewe.
Ye shul non other ende° with me maken,
That oon of yow ne shal be deed or taken.
And if yow thinketh this is wel ysaid,
Seyeth your avis,° and holdeth yow apaid.°
This is your ende and your conclusioun.”

¶Who loketh lightly° now but Palamoun?
Who springeth up for joye but Arcite?
Who couthe telle, or who couthe it endite,°
The joye that is maked in the place
Whan Theseus hath doon so fair a grace?
But doun on knees wente every maner wight,
And thonken him with al her herte and might,
And namely° the Thebans ofte sithe.
And thus with good hope and with herte blithe
They take hir leve, and homward gonne they ride
To Thebes, with his olde walles wide.

¶I trowe° men wolde deme it necligence,°
If I foryete° to tellen the dispence°
Of Theseus, that goth so bisily
To maken up the listes royally;
That swich a noble theatre° as it was,
I dar wel seyn that in this world ther nas.

¶The circuit a mile was aboute,
Walled of stoon, and diched al withoute.°
Round was the shap, in maner of compass,
Ful of degrees,° the heighte of sixty pas,°
That, whan a man was set on o degree,
He letted° nat his felawe for to see.
Estward ther stood a gate of marbel whit,
Westward, right swich another in the opposite.
And shortly to concluden, swich a place
Was noon in erthe, as in so litel space;°
For in the lond ther nas no crafty° man,
That geometrie or ars-metrik can,°
Ne purtreiour,° ne kerver° of images,
That Theseus ne yaf him mete and wages
The theatre for to maken and devise.
And for to doon° his rite° and sacrifise,
He estward hath, upon the gate° above,
In worship of Venus, goddesse of love,
Don make° an auter° and an oratorie;°
And westward, in the minde and in memorie
Of Mars, he maked hath right swich another,
That coste largely of gold a fother.°
And northward, in a touret° on the wal,
Of alabastre whit and reed coral°
An oratorie riche for to see,
In worship of Diane of chastitee,
Hath Theseus don wroght° in noble wise.
But yet hadde I foryeten° to devise
The noble kerving,° and the portreitures,°
The shap, the countenaunce,° and the figures,
That weren in thise oratories three.

¶First in the temple of Venus maystow° see
Wroght on the wal, ful pitous to biholde,
The broken slepes, and the sikes° colde;
The sacred teres,° and the waimenting;
The firy strokes of the desiring,
That loves servaunts in this lif enduren;
The othes,° that hir covenants assuren;°
Plesaunce and Hope, Desir, Foolhardinesse,
Beautee and Youthe, Bauderie,° Richesse,
Charmes and Force,° Lesinges,° Flaterie,
Dispense,° Bisinesse, and Jelousie,
That wered° of yelwe goldes° a garland,
And a cokkow° sitting on hir hand;
Festes, instruments, caroles,° daunces,
Lust° and array,° and all the circumstaunces
Of love, whiche that I rekne and rekne shal,
By ordre weren peinted on the wal,
And mo than I can make of mencioun.
For soothly, al the mount of Citheroun,
Ther Venus hath hir principal dwelling,
Was shewed on the wal in portreying,°
With al the gardin, and the lustinesse.°
Nat was foryeten° the porter Idelnesse,
Ne Narcisus the faire of yore agon,°
Ne yet the folie° of king Salamon,
Ne yet the grete strengthe of Hercules—
Th’enchauntements of Medea and Circes—
Ne of Turnus, with the hardy fiers corage,
The riche Cresus, caitif° in servage.
Thus may ye seen that wisdom ne richesse,
Beautee ne sleighte,° strengthe, ne hardinesse,°
Ne may with Venus holde champartie;°
For as hir list° the world than may she gie.°
Lo, alle thise folk so caught were in hir las,°
Til they for wo ful ofte seide “Allas!”
Sufficeth heer ensamples oon or two,
And though I coude rekne a thousand mo.
The statue of Venus, glorious for to see,
Was naked fleting° in the large see,
And fro the navele° doun all covered was
With wawes° grene, and brighte as any glas.°
A citole° in hir right hand hadde she,
And on hir heed, ful semely° for to see,
A rose gerland, fresh and wel smellinge;
Above hir heed hir dowves flikeringe.°
Biforn hir stood hir sone Cupido,
Upon his shuldres winges hadde he two;
And blind he was, as it is ofte sene;
A bowe he bar and arwes brighte and kene.°

¶Why sholde I noght as wel eek tell yow al
The portreiture, that was upon the wal
Withinne the temple of mighty Mars the rede?
Al peinted was the wal, in lengthe and brede,°
Lik to the estres° of the grisly place,
That highte° the grete temple of Mars in Trace,
In thilke° colde frosty regioun,
Theras Mars hath his soverein mansioun.
First on the wal was peinted a foreste,
In which ther dwelleth neither man ne beste,
With knotty knarry° barein treës olde
Of stubbes° sharpe and hidous° to biholde;
In which ther ran a rumbel° and a swough,°
As though a storm sholde bresten° every bough:
And downward from an hille, under° a bente,°
Ther stood the temple of Mars armipotente,°
Wroght al of burned° steel of which th’entree°
Was long and streit,° and gastly for to see.
And therout cam a rage and such a vese,°
That it made al the gates for to rese.°
The northren light in at the dores shoon,
For windowe on the wal ne was ther noon,
Thurgh which men mighten any light discerne.
The dores were alle of adamant° eterne,
Yclenched° overthwart° and endelong
With iren tough; and, for to make it strong,
Every piler, the temple to sustene,
Was tonne-greet,° of iren bright and shene.°
Ther saugh I first the derke imagining
Of felonie, and al the compassing;°
The cruel ire,° reed as any glede;°
The pikepurs,° and eek the pale drede;°
The smiler with the knif under the cloke;
The shepne° brenning° with the blake smoke;
The treson of the mordring° in the bedde;
The open werre, with woundes al bibledde;°
Contek,° with blody knif and sharp manace;°
Al ful of chirking° was that sory place.
The sleere of himself° yet saugh I ther,
His herte blood hath bathed al his heer;
The nail ydriven in the shode° anight;°
The colde deeth, with mouth gaping upright.
Amiddes of the temple sat Meschaunce,
With disconfort° and sory° contenaunce.
Yet saugh I Woodnes° laughing in his rage;
Armed Compleint,° Outhees,° and Fiers Outrage.
The careine° in the bush, with throte ycorve:°
A thousand slain, and nat of qualm° ystorve;°
The tiraunt, with the prey° by force yraft;°
The toun destroyed, ther was no thing laft.
Yet saugh I brent° the shippes hoppesteres;°
The hunte° strangled° with° the wilde beres:°
The sowe° freten° the child right in the cradel;
The cook yscalded,° for° al his longe ladel.
Noght was foryeten° by the infortune of Marte;
The carter over riden with his carte,
Under the wheel ful lowe he lay adoun.
Ther were also, of Martes division,°
The barbour,° and the bocher,° and the smith
That forgeth sharpe swerdes° on his stith.°
And al above, depeinted in a tour,
Saw I Conquest sittinge in greet honour,
With the sharpe swerde over his heed
Hanginge by a sotil twines° threed.
Depeinted was the slaughtre of Julius,
Of grete Nero, and of Antonius;
Al be that thilke° time they were unborn,
Yet was hir deeth depeinted therbiforn,
By manasinge° of Mars, right by figure;°
So was it shewed in that portreiture
As is depeinted in the sterres° above,
Who shal be slain or elles deed for love.
Sufficeth oon ensample in stories olde,
I may not rekne hem alle, thogh I wolde.°
The statue of Mars upon a carte° stood,
Armed, and loked grim as he were wood;°
And over his hed ther shinen two figures
Of sterres, that been cleped° in scriptures,
That oon Puella, that other Rubeus.
This god of armes was arrayed° thus:—
A wolf ther stood biforn him at his feet
With eyen rede, and of a man he eet;
With sotil pencel° was depeint° this storie,
In redoutinge° of Mars and of his glorie.

¶Now to the temple of Diane the chaste
As shortly as I can I wol me haste,
To telle yow al the descripcioun.
Depeinted been the walles up and doun
Of hunting and of shamfast° chastitee.
Ther saugh I how woful Calistopee,
Whan that Diane agreved° was with here,
Was turned° from a womman to° a bere,
And after was she maad the lode-sterre;°
Thus was it peint, I can say yow no ferre;°
Hir sone is eek a sterre, as men may see.
Ther saugh I Dane, yturned til° a tree,
I mene nat the goddesse Diane,
But Penneus doughter, which that highte° Dane.
Ther saugh I Attheon an hert ymaked,
For vengeaunce that he saugh Diane al naked;
I saugh how that his houndes have him caught,
And freten° him, for that they knewe° him naught.
Yet peinted was a litel forther moor,
How Atthalante hunted the wilde boor,
And Meleagre, and many another mo,
For which Diane wroghte him care and wo.
Ther saugh I many another wonder storie,
The whiche me list nat° drawen to memorie.
This goddesse on an hert ful hie seet,°
With smale houndes al aboute hir feet;
And undernethe hir feet she hadde a mone,°
Wexing° it was, and sholde wanie° sone.
In gaude° grene hir statue clothed was,
With bowe in honde, and arwes in a cas.°
Hir eyen caste she ful lowe adoun,
Ther Pluto hath his derke regioun.
A womman travailinge° was hir biforn,
But, for hir child so longe was unborn,
Ful pitously Lucina gan she calle,
And seide, “Help, for thou mayst best of alle.”
Wel couthe he peinten lifly that it wroghte,°
With many a florin he the hewes° boghte.
Now been thise listes maad, and Theseus,
That at his grete cost arrayed thus
The temples and the theatre every del°
Whan it was doon, him liked wonder wel.

¶But stinte° I wol of Theseus a lite,
And speke of Palamon and of Arcite.
The day approcheth of hir retourninge,
That everich sholde an hundred knightes bringe,
The bataille to darreine,° as I yow tolde;
And til Athenes, hir covenant° for to holde,
Hath everich of hem broght an hundred knightes
Wel armed for the werre at alle rightes.°
And sikerly,° ther trowed° many a man
That never, sithen° that the world bigan,
As for to speke of knighthod of hir hond,°
As fer as God hath maked see or lond,
Nas, of so fewe, so noble a companie.
For every wight that lovede chivalrie,
And wolde, his thankes,° han a passant° name,
Hath preyed that he might ben of that game;°
And wel was him, that therto chosen was.
For if ther fill tomorwe swich a cas,
Ye knowen wel that every lusty knight,
That loveth paramours,° and hath his might,
Were it in Engelond, or elleswhere,
They wolde, hir thankes, wilnen° to be there.
To fighte for a lady, benedicite!°
It were a lusty° sighte for to see.
And right so ferden° they with Palamon.
With him ther wenten knightes many oon;
Som wol ben armed in an habergeoun,°
In a brest plat and in a light gipoun;°
And som woln have a peire plates° large;
And som woln have a Pruce sheld,° or a targe;°
Som woln ben armed on hir legges weel
And have an ax, and somme a mace of steel.
Ther nis no newe gise,° that it nas old.°
Armed were they, as I have you told,
Everich after° his opinioun.

¶Ther maistow seen coming with Palamoun
Ligurge himself, the grete king of Trace;
Blak was his berd, and manly was his face.
The cercles° of his eyen° in his heed,
They gloweden bitwixe° yelow and reed;
And lik a griffon° loked he aboute,
With kempe° heres on his browes stoute;
His limes grete, his braunes° harde and stronge,
His shuldres brode, his armes rounde and longe.
And as the gise was in his contree,
Ful hie upon a char° of gold stood he,
With foure white boles° in the trais.°
Instede of cote armure over his harnais,
With nailes yelwe and brighte as any gold,
He hadde a beres skin, col blak, for-old.
His longe heer was kembd° bihinde his bak,
As any ravenes fether it shoon for-blak:°
A wrethe° of gold arm-greet,° of huge wighte,°
Upon his heed, set ful of stones° brighte,
Of fine rubies and of diamaunts.
Aboute his char ther wenten white alaunts,°
Twenty and mo, as grete as any steer,
To hunten at the leoun or the deer,
And folwed him, with mosel° faste ybounde,
Colers of gold, and torets° filed° rounde.
An hundred lordes hadde he in his route
Armed ful wel with hertes sterne and stoute.

¶With Arcita, in stories as men finde,
The grete Emetreus, the king of Inde,
Upon a stede bay,° trapped° in steel
Covered in cloth of gold diapred° weel
Cam riding lik the god of armes, Mars.
His cote-armure was of cloth of Tars,
Couched with perles white and rounde and grete.
His sadel was of brend° gold newe ybete;°
A mantelet° upon his shuldre hanginge
Bret-ful° of rubies rede, as fir sparklinge.
His crispe° heer lik ringes was yronne,°
And that was yelow, and glitered as the sonne.
His nose was heigh, his eyen bright citrin,°
His lippes rounde, his colour was sangwin,°
A fewe fraknes° in his face yspreind,°
Betwixen° yelow and somdel blak ymeind,°
And as a leoun he his loking caste.°
Of five and twenty yeer his age I caste.°
His berd was wel bigonne for to springe;
His vois was as a trompe° thonderinge.
Upon his heed he wered of laurer° grene
A gerland fresh and lusty° for to sene.
Upon his hand he bar, for his deduit,°
An egle tame, as eny lilie whit.
An hundred lordes hadde he with him there,
Al armed, sauf° hir heddes, in al hir gere,
Ful richely in alle maner thinges.
For trusteth wel that dukes, erles, kinges,
Were gadered in this noble companie,
For love and for encrees° of chivalrie.
Aboute this king ther ran on every part
Ful many a tame leoun and lepart.°

¶And in this wise thise lordes, alle and some,
Ben on the Sonday to the citee come
Aboute prime, and in the toun alight.
This Theseus, this duk, this worthy knight,
Whan he had broght hem into his citee,
And inned° hem, everich in his degree,
He festeth° hem, and dooth so greet labour
To esen° hem, and doon hem al honour,
That yet men wenen° that no mannes wit
Of noon estat ne coude amenden° it.
The minstralcie, the service at the feste,
The grete yiftes° to the moste and leste,
The riche array° of Theseus paleis,
Ne who sat first ne last upon the deis,°
What ladies fairest been or best daunsinge,
Or which of hem can chaunten best and singe,
Ne who most felingly° speketh of love:
What haukes° sitten on the perche above,
What houndes liggen on the floor adoun:
Of al this make I now no mencioun;
But al th’effect, that thinketh me° the beste;
Now comth the point, and herkneth if yow leste.

¶The Sonday night, er day bigan to springe,
When Palamon the larke herde singe,
Although it nere° nat day by houres two,
Yet song the larke, and Palamon also.
With holy herte, and with an heigh corage°
He roos, to wenden° on his pilgrimage
Unto the blisful Citherea benigne,
I mene Venus, honurable and digne.°
And in hir houre he walketh forth a pas°
Unto the listes, ther hir temple was,
And doun he kneleth, and with humble chere°
And herte soor, he seide as ye shul here.
“Faireste of faire, O lady min, Venus,
Doughter to Jove and spouse of Vulcanus,
Thou glader of the mount of Citheroun,
For thilke° love thou haddest to Adoun,
Have pitee of my bittre teres smerte,°
And tak min humble preier at thin herte.
Allas! I ne have no langage to telle
Th’effectes ne the torments of min helle;
Min herte may mine harmes nat biwreie;°
I am so confus, that I can noght seye.
But mercy, lady bright, that knowest weel
My thought, and seest what harmes that I feel
Considere al this, and rewe° upon my sore,°
As wisly° as I shal for evermore,
Emforth° my might, thy trewe° servant be,
And holden° werre alwey with chastitee;
That make I min avow,° so ye me helpe.
I kepe° noght of armes for to yelpe,°
Ne I ne axe° nat tomorwe to have victorie,
Ne renoun° in this cas, ne veine glorie
Of pris° of armes blowen° up and doun,
But I wolde have fully possessioun
Of Emelye, and die in thy servise;
Find thou the maner how, and in what wise.
I recche° nat, but° it may bettre be,
To have victorie of hem, or they of me,
So that° I have my lady in mine armes.
For though so be° that Mars is god of armes,
Your vertu° is so greet in hevene above,
That, if yow list,° I shal wel have my love,
Thy temple wol I worshipe evermo,
And on thin auter,° wher I ride or go,°
I wol don sacrifice, and fires bete.°
And if ye wol nat so, my lady swete,
Than preye I thee, tomorwe with a spere
That Arcita me thurgh the herte bere.°
Thanne rekke° I noght, whan I have lost my lif,
Though that° Arcita winne hir to his wif.
This is th’effect° and ende° of my preiere,
Yif me my love, thou blisful lady dere.”

¶Whan th’orisoun° was doon of Palamon,
His sacrifice he dide, and that anon
Ful pitously,° with alle circumstaunce,°
Al telle I noght as now his observaunce.
But atte laste the statue of Venus shook,
And made a signe, wherby that he took
That his preiere accepted was that day.
For thogh the signe shewed a delay,
Yet wiste° he wel that graunted was his bone;°
And with glad herte he wente him hoom ful sone.°

¶The thridde houre inequal that Palamon
Bigan to Venus temple for to goon,
Up roos the sonne, and up roos Emelie,
And to the temple of Diane gan hie.°
Hir maidens, that she thider° with hir ladde,
Ful redily with hem the fir° they hadde,
Thencens, the clothes, and the remenant° al
That to the sacrifice longen° shal;
The hornes fulle of meth,° as was the gise;°
Ther lakked noght° to doon hir sacrifise.
Smoking° the temple, ful of clothes° faire,
This Emelie, with herte debonaire,°
Hir body wessh with water of a welle;
But how she dide hir rite I dar nat telle,
But it be any thing in general;
And yet it were a game° to heren al;
To him that meneth wel° it were no charge:
But it is good a man ben at his large.°
Hir brighte heer was kempt, untressed° al;
A coroune of a grene ook cerial°
Upon hir heed was set ful fair and mete.°
Two fires on the auter gan she bete,°
And dide hir thinges, as men may biholde
In Stace of Thebes, and thise bokes olde.
Whan kindled was the fir, with pitous chere°
Unto Diane she spak, as ye may here.

¶“O chaste goddesse of the wodes grene,
To whom bothe hevene and erthe and see is sene,
Quene of the regne of Pluto derk and lowe,
Goddesse of maidens, that min herte hast knowe
Ful many a yeer, and woost° what I desire,
As keep me° fro thy vengeaunce and thin ire,°
That Attheon aboughte° cruelly.
Chaste goddesse, wel wostow° that I
Desire to been a maiden° al my lif,
Ne never wol° I be no love ne wif.°
I am, thou woost, yet of thy companie,
A maide,° and love hunting and venerie,
And for to walken in the wodes wilde,
And noght to been a wif, and be with childe.
Noght wol° I knowe companie of man.°
Now help me, lady, sith° ye may and can,
For tho° thre formes that thou hast in thee.
And Palamon, that hath swich love to me,
And eek Arcite, that loveth me so sore,°
This grace° I preye thee withoute° more,
As sende love and pees bitwixe hem two;
And fro me turne awey hir hertes so,
That al hir hote love, and hir desir,
And al hir bisy torment, and hir fir
Be queint,° or turned in another place;
And if so be° thou wolt do me no grace,
Or if my destinee be shapen so,
That I shal nedes have° oon of hem two,
As sende me him that most desireth me.
Bihold, goddesse of clene° chastitee,
The bittre teres that on my chekes falle.
Sin thou are maide, and keper of us alle,
My maidenhede° thou kepe and wel conserve,
And whil I live a maide, I wol thee serve.”

¶The fires brenne° upon the auter clere,
Whil Emelie was thus in hir preiere;
But sodeinly she saugh a sighte queinte,°
For right anon oon of the fires queinte,°
And quiked again,° and after that anon
That other fir was queint, and al agon;
And as it queinte, it made a whistelinge,
As doon thise wete brondes° in hir brenninge,°
And at the brondes ende outran anoon
As it were blody dropes many oon;
For which so sore agast° was Emelie,
That she was wel ny mad, and gan to crie,
For she ne wiste° what it signified;
But only for the fere thus hath she cried,
And weep,° that it was pitee for to here.

¶And therwithal Diane gan appere,°
With bowe in hond, right as an hunteresse,
And seide: “Doghter, stint° thin hevinesse.
Among the goddes hie it is affirmed,
And by eterne word write and confermed,
Thou shalt ben wedded unto oon of tho
That han for thee so muchel° care and wo;
But unto which of hem I may nat telle.
Farwel for I ne may no lenger dwelle.
The fires which that on min auter brenne°
Shul thee declaren, er that thou go henne,°
Thin aventure° of love, as in this cas.”°
And with that word, the arwes in the cas°
Of the goddesse clateren faste and ringe,
And forth she wente, and made a vanisshinge;
For which this Emelye astoned° was,
And seide, “What amounteth this,° allas!
I putte me in thy proteccioun,
Diane, and in thy disposicioun.”°
And hoom she gooth anon the nexte° weye.
This is th’effect,° ther is namore to seye.

¶The nexte houre of Mars folwinge this,
Arcite unto the temple walked is
Of fierse Mars, to doon his sacrifise,
With alle the rites of his paien wise.°
With pitous° herte and heigh devocioun,
Right thus to Mars he seide his orisoun:
“O stronge god, that in the regnes colde
Of Trace honoured art, and lord yholde,°
And hast in every regne° and every lond
Of armes al the bridel in thin hond,
And hem fortunest° as thee list devise,
Accept of me my pitous sacrifise.
If so be that my youthe may deserve,
And that my might be worthy for to serve
Thy godhede, that I may been oon of thine,
Than preye I thee to rewe° upon my pine.
For thilke° peine, and thilke hote fir,
In which thou whilom° brendest° for desir,
Whan that thou usedest° the grete beautee
Of faire yonge fresshe Venus free,°
And haddest hir in armes at thy wille,
Although thee ones on a time misfille°
Whan Vulcanus had caught thee in his las,°
And fond thee ligging° by his wif, allas!
For thilke sorwe that was in thin herte,
Have routhe as wel upon my peines smerte.
I am yong and unkonning,° as thou wost,
And, as I trowe, with love offended most,
That ever was any lives creature;
For she, that dooth me al this wo endure,
Ne reccheth° never wher I sinke or flete.°
And wel I woot, er° she me mercy hete,°
I moot° with strengthe winne hir in the place;°
And wel I woot,° withouten help or grace
Of thee, ne may my strengthe noght availle.
Than help me, lord, tomorwe in my bataille,
For thilke fir that whilom brente° thee,
As wel as thilke fir now brenneth me;
And do that I tomorwe have victorie.
Min be the travaille,° and thin be the glorie!
Thy soverein temple wol I most honouren
Of any place, and alwey most labouren
In thy plesaunce and in thy craftes stronge,
And in thy temple I wol my baner° honge,°
And alle the armes of my companie;
And everemo, unto that day I die,
Eterne fir I wol biforn thee finde.°
And eek to this avow° I wol me binde:
My berd,° min heer that hongeth long adoun,
That never yet ne felte offensioun°
Of rasour nor of shere,° I wol thee yive,
And ben thy trewe servant whil I live.
Now lord, have routhe upon my sorwes sore,
Yif me victorie, I aske thee namore.”

¶The preiere stinte° of Arcita the stronge,
The ringes on the temple dore that honge,
And eek the dores, clatereden ful faste,
Of which Arcita somwhat him agaste.°
The fires brende upon the auter° brighte,
That it gan al the temple for to lighte;
And swete° smel the ground anon up yaf,
And Arcita anon his hand uphaf,°
And more encens° into the fir he caste,
With othere rites mo; and atte laste
The statue of Mars bigan his hauberk° ringe.
And with that soun he herde a murmuringe
Ful lowe and dim, that saide thus, “Victorie!”
For which he yaf to Mars honour and glorie.
And thus with joye, and hope wel to fare,
Arcite anon unto his inne° is fare,
As fain as fowel° is of the brighte sonne.

¶And right anon swich strif ther is bigonne
For thilke graunting, in the hevene above,
Bitwixe Venus, the goddesse of love,
And Mars, the sterne god armipotente,
That Jupiter was bisy it to stente;°
Til that the pale Saturnus the colde,
That knew so manie of aventures olde,
Fond in his olde experience an art,°
That he ful sone hath plesed every part.
As sooth is said, elde° hath greet avantage:
In elde is bothe wisdom and usage;°
Men may the olde atrenne,° and noght atrede.°
Saturne anon, to stinten° strif and drede,
Al be it that it is again his kinde,°
Of al this strif he gan remedie finde.

¶“My dere doghter Venus,” quod Saturne,
“My cours, that hath so wide for to turne,
Hath more power than wot° any man.
Min is the drenching° in the see so wan;°
Min is the prison in the derke cote;°
Min is the strangling and hanging by the throte;
The murmure,° and the cherles° rebelling,
The groining,° and the privee° empoisoning:
I do° vengeance and plein correccioun°
Whil I dwelle in the signe of the leoun.
Min is the ruine of the hye halles,
The falling of the toures and of the walles
Upon the minour° or the carpenter.
I slow° Sampsoun in shaking the piler;
And mine be the maladies colde,
The derke tresons, and the castes° olde;
My loking° is the fader° of pestilence.
Now weep namore, I shal doon diligence
That Palamon, that is thin owne knight,
Shal have his lady, as thou hast him hight.°
Though Mars shal helpe his knight, yet nathelees°
Bitwixe yow ther moot be som time pees,
Al be° ye noght of o complexioun,°
That causeth al day swich divisioun.
I am thin aiel° redy at thy wille;
Weep thou namore, I wol thy lust° fulfille.”
Now wol I stinten of the goddes above,
Of Mars, and of Venus, goddesse of love,
And telle yow, as pleinly as I can,
The grete effect, for which that I bigan.

¶Greet was the feste in Athenes that day,
And eek the lusty° seson of that May
Made every wight° to been in swich plesaunce,
That al that Monday justen° they and daunce,
And spenden it in Venus heigh servise.
But by the cause that they sholde rise
Erly, for to seen the grete fight,
Unto hir reste wente they at night.
And on the morwe, whan that day gan springe,
Of hors and harneis, noise and clateringe
Ther was in hostelries al aboute;
And to the paleis rood ther many a route°
Of lordes, upon stedes° and palfreis.°
Ther maystow seen devising° of herneis
So uncouth° and so riche, and wroght° so weel
Of goldsmithrie, of browding,° and of steel;
The sheeldes brighte, testers,° and trappures;°
Gold hewen° helmes, hauberks,° cote-armures;
Lordes in paraments° on hir courseres,°
Knightes of retenue,° and eek squieres
Nailinge the speres,° and helmes bokelinge,°
Gigginge of sheeldes, with laineres lacing;°
Ther as need is, they weren nothing idel;
The fomy° stedes on the golden bridel°
Gnawinge, and faste° the armurers also
With file and hamer prikinge° to and fro;
Yemen° on fote, and communes° many oon
With shorte staves, thikke as they may goon;
Pipes, trompes, nakers,° clariounes,°
That in the bataille blowen blody sounes;
The paleis ful of peples up and doun,
Heer three, ther ten, holding hir questioun,°
Divininge° of thise Thebane knightes two.

¶Som seiden thus, som seide it shal be so;
Som helden° with him with the blake berd,
Som with the balled,° som with the thikke-herd;°
Som saide, he loked grim and he wolde fighte;
He hath a sparth° of twenty pound of wighte.
Thus was the halle ful of divininge,
Longe after that the sonne gan to springe.
The grete Theseus, that of his sleep awaked
With minstralcie and noise that was maked,
Held° yet the chambre of his paleis riche,
Til that the Thebane knightes, bothe iliche°
Honoured, were into the paleis fet.°

¶Duk Theseus was at a window set,
Arrayed° right as he were a god in trone.
The peple preesseth thiderward ful sone
Him for to seen, and doon heigh reverence,
And eek to herkne his hest and his sentence.°
An heraud° on a scaffold made an “Ho!”
Til al the noise of the peple was ydo;°
And whan he saugh the noise of peple al stille,
Tho showed he the mighty dukes wille.
“The lord hath of his heigh discrecioun°
Considered, that it were destruccioun
To gentil° blood, to fighten in the gise°
Of mortal bataille now in this emprise;°
Wherfore, to shapen that they shul not die,
He wol his firste purpos modifie.
No man therfor, up peine° of los of lif,
No maner shot,° pollax,° ne shorte knif
Into the listes sende, ne thider bringe;
Ne short swerd for to stoke,° with point bitinge,
No man ne drawe, ne bere it by his side.
Ne no man shal unto his felawe ride
But o cours,° with a sharp ygrounde spere;
Foine,° if him list, on fote, himself to were.°
And he that is at meschief,° shal be take,
And noght slain, but be broght unto the stake
That shal ben ordeined on either side;
But thider he shal by force, and ther abide.
And if so falle, the chieftain be take
On either side, or elles slee his make,°
No lenger shal the turneyinge° laste.
God spede yow; goth forth, and ley on faste.°
With long swerd and with maces fight your fille.
Goth now your wey; this is the lordes wille.”

¶The vois of peple touchede the hevene,
So loude criden they with mery stevene:°
“God save swich a lord, that is so good,
He wilneth no destruccioun of blood!”
Up goon the trompes and the melodie.
And to the listes rit° the companie
By ordinaunce, thurghout the citee large,
Hanged with cloth of gold, and nat with sarge.°
Ful lik a lord this noble duk gan ride,
Thise two Thebanes upon either side;
And after rood the quene, and Emelie,
And after that another companie
Of oon and other, after hir degree.
And thus they passen thurghout the cite,
And to the listes come they by time.
It nas not of the day yet fully prime,°
Whan set was Theseus ful riche and hie,°
Ipolita the quene and Emelie,
And other ladies in degrees aboute.
Unto the seetes preesseth al the route.°
And westward, thurgh the gates under Marte,
Arcite, and eek the hundred of his parte,
With baner reed is entred right anon;
And in that selve° moment Palamon
Is under Venus, estward in the place,
With baner whit, and hardy chere° and face.
In al the world, to seken up and doun,
So even withouten variacioun,
Ther nere° swiche companies tweie.
For ther nas noon so wis that coude seye,
That any hadde of other avauntage
Of worthinesse, ne of estaat,° ne age,
So even were they chosen, for to gesse.°
And in two renges° faire they hem dresse.
Whan that hir names rad° were everichoon,
That in hir nombre gile° were ther noon,
Tho were the gates shet, and cried was loude:
“Do now your devoir,° yonge knightes proude!”
The heraudes lefte hir priking up and doun;
Now ringen trompes loude and clarioun;°

¶Ther is namore to seyn, but west and est
In goon the speres ful sadly° in arest;°
In goth the sharpe spore° into the side.
Ther seen men who can juste,° and who can ride;
Ther shiveren° shaftes upon sheeldes thikke;
He feleth thurgh the herte-spoon° the prikke.
Up springen speres twenty foot on highte;
Out goon the swerdes as the silver brighte.
The helmes they tohewen° and toshrede;
Out brest° the blood, with sterne° stremes rede.
With mighty maces the bones they tobreste.°
He thurgh the thikkeste of the throng gan threste.°
Ther stomblen stedes stronge, and doun goth al.
He rolleth under foot as dooth a bal.
He foineth° on his feet with his tronchoun,°
And he him hurtleth° with his hors adoun.
He thurgh the body is hurt, and sithen ytake,°
Maugree his heed,° and broght unto the stake,
As forward° was, right ther he moste abide;
Another lad is° on that other side.
And som time dooth° hem Theseus to reste,
Hem to refresshe, and drinken if hem leste.

¶Ful ofte aday° han thise Thebanes two
Togidre ymet, and wroght his felawe wo;
Unhorsed hath ech other of hem tweie.°
Ther nas no tigre in the vale of Galgopheie,
Whan that hir whelp° is stole, whan it is lite,
So cruel on the hunte, as is Arcite
For jelous herte upon this Palamoun:
Ne in Belmarie ther nis° so fel leoun,
That hunted is, or for his hunger wood,°
Ne of his praye° desireth so the blood,
As Palamon to sleen his fo Arcite.
The jelous strokes on hir helmes bite;
Out renneth blood on bothe hir sides rede.
Som time an ende ther is of every dede;°
For er° the sonne unto the reste wente,
The stronge king Emetreus gan hente°
This Palamon, as he faught with Arcite,
And made his swerd depe in his flesh to bite;
And by the force of twenty is he take
Unyolden,° and ydrawe unto the stake.
And in the rescous of this Palamoun
The stronge king Ligurge is born adoun;
And king Emetreus, for° al his strengthe,
Is born out of his sadel a swerdes lengthe,
So hitte him Palamon er he were take;
But al for noght, he was broght to the stake.
His hardy herte mighte him helpe naught;
He moste abide, whan that he was caught
By force, and eek by composicioun.°

¶Who sorweth now but woful Palamoun,
That moot° namore goon again to fighte?
And whan that Theseus had seyn this sighte,
Unto the folk that foghten thus echoon°
He cride, “Ho! namore, for it is doon!
I wol be trewe juge, and no partie.°
Arcite of Thebes shal have Emelie,
That by his fortune hath hir faire ywonne.”
Anon ther is a noise of peple bigonne
For joye of this, so loude and heigh withalle,
It semed that the listes sholde falle.
What can now faire Venus doon above?
What seith she now? what dooth this quene of love?
But wepeth so, for wanting of hir wille,°
Til that hir teres in the listes fille;°
She seide: “I am ashamed, doutelees.”
Saturnus seide: “Doghter, hold thy pees.
Mars hath his wille, his knight hath al his bone,°
And, by min heed, thou shalt ben esed° sone.”

¶The trompes, with the loude minstralcie,
The heraudes, that ful loude yolle° and crie,
Been in hir wele° for joye of daun Arcite.
But herkneth me, and stinteth° now a lite,
Which a miracle ther bifel anon.
This fierse Arcite hath of his helm ydon,
And on a courser,° for to shewe his face,
He priketh° endelong the large place,
Loking upward upon this Emelie;
And she again him caste a freendlich yë,°
(For wommen, as to speken in comune,°
They folwen al the favour of fortune),
And she was al his chere,° as in his herte.
Out of the ground a furie infernal sterte,°
From Pluto sent, at requeste of Saturne,
For which his hors for fere gan to turne,
And leep aside, and foundred° as he leep;°
And, er that Arcite may taken keep,°
He pighte him° on the pomel of his heed,°
That in the place he lay as he were deed,
His brest tobrosten with his sadelbowe.
As blak he lay as any cole° or crowe,
So was the blood yronnen in his face.
Anon he was yborn out of the place
With herte soor, to Theseus paleis.
Tho was he corven° out of his harneis,
And in a bed ybrought ful faire and blive,°
For he was yet in memorie and alive,
And alway crying after Emelie.

¶Duk Theseus, with al his companie,
Is comen hoom to Athenes his citee,
With alle blisse and greet solempnitee.°
Al be it that this aventure was falle,°
He nolde noght° disconforten hem alle.
Men seide eek, that Arcite shal nat die;
He shal ben heled of his maladie.
And of another thing they were as fain,
That of hem alle was ther noon yslain,
Al were° they sore yhurt, and namely° oon,
That with a spere was thirled° his brest boon.
To othere woundes, and to broken armes,
Some hadden salves, and some hadden charmes;
Fermacies° of herbes, and eek save°
They dronken, for they wolde hir limes have.°
For which this noble duk, as he wel can,
Conforteth and honoureth every man,
And made revel al the longe night,
Unto the straunge° lordes, as was right.
Ne ther was holden no disconfitinge,°
But as a justes or a tourneyinge;
For soothly° ther was no disconfiture,°
For falling nis° nat but an aventure;
Ne to be lad with fors° unto the stake
Unyolden,° and with twenty knightes take,
O persone allone, withouten mo,
And haried° forth by arme, foot, and to,
And eek his stede driven forth with staves,
With footmen, bothe yemen and eek knaves,
It nas aretted° him no vileinie,
Ther may no man clepen° it cowardie.

¶For which anon duk Theseus leet crie,°
To stinten° alle rancour and envie,°
The gree° as wel of o side as of other,
And either side ilik, as otheres brother;
And yaf hem yiftes° after hir degree,
And fully heeld a feste dayes three;
And conveyed° the kinges worthily
Out of his toun a journee largely.°
And hoom wente every man the righte way.
Ther was namore, but “far wel have good day!”
Of this bataille I wol namore endite,°
But speke of Palamon and of Arcite.

¶Swelleth the brest of Arcite, and the sore
Encreesseth at his herte more and more.
The clothered° blood, for any lechecraft,°
Corrupteth,° and is in his bouk° ylaft,
That neither veine-blood,° ne ventusinge,°
Ne drinke of herbes may ben his helpinge.
The vertu expulsif,° or animal,
Fro thilke° vertu cleped natural
Ne may the venim voiden,° ne expelle.
The pipes of his longes° gonne to swelle,
And every lacerte° in his brest adoun
Is shent° with venim and corrupcioun.
Him gaineth° neither, for to gete° his lif,
Vomit upward, ne dounward laxatif;
Al is tobrosten° thilke regioun,
Nature hath now no dominacioun.
And certeinly, ther nature wol nat wirche,
Farwel phisik!° go ber the man to chirche!

¶This al and som, that Arcita mot die,
For which he sendeth after Emelie,
And Palamon, that was his cosin dere;
Than seide he thus, as ye shul after here.
“Naught may the woful spirit in min herte
Declare o point of al my sorwes smerte°
To yow, my lady, that I love most;
But I biquethe the service of my gost°
To yow aboven every creature,
Sin that my life may no lenger dure.
Allas, the wo! allas, the peines stronge,
That I for yow have suffred, and so longe!
Allas, the deeth! allas, min Emelie!
Allas, departing of our companie!
Allas, min hertes quene! allas, my wif!
Min hertes lady, endere of my lif!
What is this world? what asketh men to have?
Now with his love, now in his colde grave
Allone, withouten any companie.
Farwel my swete fo! min Emelie!
And softe tak me in your armes tweie,°
For love of God, and herkneth° what I seye.
I have heer with my cosin Palamon
Had strif and rancour, many a day agon,
For love of yow, and for my jelousie.
And Jupiter so wis° my soule gie,°
To speken of a servant proprely,°
With alle circumstaunces trewely,
That is to seyn, trouthe,° honour, and knighthead,
Wisdom, humblesse, estaat,° and heigh kinrede,°
Fredom,° and al that longeth to that art,°
So Jupiter have of my soule part,
As in this world right now ne knowe I non
So worthy to ben loved as Palamon,
That serveth yow, and wol don al his lif.
And if that ever ye shul been a wif,
Foryet nat Palamon, the gentil man.”

¶And with that word his speche faille gan,
For from his feet up to his brest° was come
The cold of deeth, that hadde him overcome.
And yet moreover, in his armes two
The vital strengthe is lost, and al ago.°
Only the intellect, withouten more,
That dwelled in his herte sik° and sore,
Gan faillen, when the herte felte deeth,
Dusked° his eyen two, and failled breeth.
But on his lady yet caste he his yë;
His laste word was, “Mercy, Emelie!”

¶His spirit chaunged hous,° and wente ther,
As I cam never, I can nat tellen wher.
Therfor I stinte, I nam no divinistre;°
Of soules finde I nat in this registre,°
Ne me ne list thilke opiniouns to telle
Of hem, though that they writen wher they dwelle.
Arcite is cold, ther Mars his soule gie;°

¶Now wol I speken forth of Emelie.
Shrighte° Emelie, and howleth Palamon,
And Theseus his suster took anon
Swowninge,° and bar hir fro the corps away.
What helpeth it to tarien forth° the day,
To tellen how she weep, bothe eve and morwe?
For in swich cas wommen have swich sorwe,
Whan that hir housbonds been from hem ago,
That for the more part they sorwen° so,
Or elles fallen in swich maladie,
That at the laste certeinly they die.
Infinite been the sorwes and the teres
Of olde folk, and folk of tendre yeres,
In al the toun, for deeth of this Theban;
For him ther wepeth bothe child and man;
So greet a weping was ther noon, certain,
Whan Ector was ybroght, al fresh yslain,
To Troye; allas! the pitee that was ther,
Cracching° of chekes, rending eek of heer.°
“Why woldestow be deed,” thise wommen crie,
“And haddest gold ynough, and Emelie?”

¶No man mighte gladen Theseus,
Savinge his olde fader Egeus,
That knew this worldes transmutacioun,°
As he had seyn it chaungen up and doun,
Joye after wo, and wo after gladnesse:
And shewed hem ensamples and liknesse.°
“Right as° ther deied° never man,” quod he,
“That he ne livede in erthe in som degree,°
Right so ther livede never man,” he seide,
“In al this world, that som time he ne deide.
This world nis but a thurghfare° ful of wo,
And we ben pilgrimes, passinge to and fro;
Deeth is an ende of every worldly sore.”°
And over al this yet seide he muchel° more
To this effect, ful wisly to enhorte°
The peple, that they sholde hem reconforte.°

¶Duk Theseus, with al his bisy cure,°
Caste now wher that the sepulture°
Of good Arcite may best ymaked be,
And eek most honurable in his degree.
And at the laste he took conclusioun,
That ther as first Arcite and Palamoun
Hadden for love the bataille hem bitwene,
That in that selve° grove, swote and grene,
Ther as he hadde his amorous desires,
His compleint, and for love his hote fires,
He wolde make a fir, in which th’office°
Funeral he mighte al accomplice;
And leet comaunde anon° to hakke and hewe
The okes olde, and leye hem on a rewe°
In colpons° wel arrayed for to brenne;°
His officers with swifte feet they renne°
And ride anon at his comaundement.
And after this, Theseus hath ysent
After a bere,° and it al overspradd
With cloth of gold, the richest that he hadde.
And of the same suite he cladde Arcite;
Upon his hondes hadde he gloves white;
Eek on his heed a croune of laurer° grene,
And in his hond a swerd ful bright and kene.
He leide him bare the visage° on the bere,
Therwith he weep that pitee was to here.
And for the peple sholde seen him alle,
Whan it was day, he broghte him to the halle,
That roreth° of the crying and the soun.

¶Tho cam this woful Theban Palamoun,
With flotery° berd, and ruggy asshy heres,
In clothes blake, ydropped al with teres;
And, passing° othere of weping, Emelie,
The rewfulleste° of al the companie.
In as muche as the service sholde be
The more noble and riche in his degree,
Duk Theseus leet forth three stedes bringe,
That trapped° were in steel al gliteringe,
And covered with the armes of daun° Arcite.
Upon thise stedes, that weren grete and white,
Ther seten folk, of which oon bar his sheeld,
Another his spere up in his hondes heeld;
The thridde bar with him his bowe Turkeis,°
Of brend gold° was the cas,° and eek the harneis;
And riden forth a pas with sorweful chere°
Toward the grove, as ye shul after here.
The nobleste of the Grekes that ther were
Upon hir shuldres carieden the bere,°
With slakke pas,° and eyen rede and wete,
Thurghout the citee, by the maister-strete,
That sprad was al with blak, and wonder hie°
Right of the same is al the strete ywrie.°
Upon the right hond wente old Egeus,
And on that other side duk Theseus,
With vessels in hir hand of gold ful fin,
Al ful of hony, milk, and blood, and win;°
Eek Palamon, with ful greet companie;
And after that cam woful Emelie,
With fir in honde, as was that time the gise,°
To do th’office° of funeral servise.
Heigh° labour, and ful greet apparaillinge°
Was at the service and the fir-makinge,
That with his grene top the heven raughte,°
And twenty fadme of brede° the armes straughte;°
This is to seyn, the bowes° were so brode.
Of stree° first ther was leid ful many a lode.
But how the fir was maked up on highte,°
And eek the names how the treës highte,°
As ook, fir, birch, asp,° alder, holm, popler,°
Wilow, elm, plane, ash, box, chastein,° lind,° laurer,°
Mapul, thorn,° beech, hasel, ew,° whippeltree,°
How they weren feld,° shal nat be told for me;°
Ne how the goddes ronnen up and doun,
Disherited° of hir habitacioun,
In which they woneden° in reste and pees,
Nymphes, Faunes, and Amadriades;
Ne how the bestes and the briddes° alle
Fledden for fere, whan the wode was falle;
Ne how the ground agast° was of the light,
That was nat wont° to seen the sonne bright;
Ne how the fir was couched° first with stree,
And than with dreye stokkes° cloven a three,
And than with grene wode and spicerie,
And than with cloth of gold and with perrie,°
And gerlandes hanging with ful many a flour,
The mirre,° th’encens, with al so greet odour;
Ne how Arcite lay among al this,
Ne what richesse aboute his body is;
Ne how that Emelie, as was the gise,°
Putte in the fir of funeral servise;
Ne how she swowned° whan men made the fir,
Ne what she spak, ne what was hir desir;
Ne what jeweles men in the fir tho caste,
Whan that the fir was greet and brente° faste;
Ne how som caste hir sheeld, and som hir spere,
And of hir vestiments, whiche that they were,
And cuppes ful of win, and milke and blood,
Into the fir, that brente as it were wood;°
Ne how the Grekes with an huge route°
Thriës riden al the fir aboute
Upon the left hand, with a loud shoutinge,
And thriës with hir speres clateringe;
And thriës how the ladies gonne crie;
Ne how that lad was homward Emelie;
Ne how Arcite is brent to asshen colde;
Ne how that liche-wake° was yholde
Al thilke night, ne how the Grekes pleye
The wake-pleyes,° ne kepe° I nat to seye;
Who wrastleth best naked, with oille enoint,°
Ne who that bar him best, in no disjoint.°
I wol nat tellen eek how that they goon
Hoom til Athenes, whan the pley is doon;
But shortly to the point than wol I wende,°
And maken of my longe tale an ende.

¶By processe and by lengthe of certein yeres
Al stinted° is the moorning and the teres
Of Grekes, by oon general assent.
Than semed me ther was a parlement
At Athenes, upon certein points and cas;°
Among the whiche points yspoken was
To have with certein contrees alliaunce,
And have fully of Thebans obeisaunce.°
For which this noble Theseus anon
Leet senden° after gentil Palamon,
Unwist of° him what was the cause and why;
But in his blake clothes sorwefully
He cam at his comaundement in hie.°
Tho sente Theseus for Emelie.
Whan they were set, and hust° was al the place,
And Theseus abiden° hadde a space
Er any word cam from his wise brest,
His eyen sette he ther as was his lest,°
And with a sad° visage he siked° stille,
And after that right thus he seide his wille.

¶“The First Moevere° of the cause above,
Whan he first made the faire cheine of love,
Greet was th’effect, and heigh° was his entente;
Wel wiste° he why, and what therof he mente;°
For with that faire cheine of love he bond
The fir, the eir, the water, and the lond
In certein boundes, that they may nat flee;°
That same prince and that moevere,” quod he,
“Hath stablissed, in this wrecched world adoun,
Certeine dayes and duracioun
To al that is engendred in this place,
Over the whiche day they may nat pace,°
Al mowe° they yet tho dayes wel abregge;°
Ther needeth non auctoritee allegge,°
For it is preved by experience,
But that me list° declaren my sentence.°
Than may men by this ordre wel discerne,
That thilke moevere stable is and eterne.
Wel may men knowe, but it be° a fool,
That every part deriveth° from his hool.
For nature hath nat taken his beginning
Of no partie ne cantel° of a thing,
But of a thing that parfit° is and stable,
Descending so, til it be corrumpable.°
And therfore, of his wise purveiaunce,°
He hath so wel biset his ordinaunce,
That speces° of thinges and progressiouns°
Shullen enduren by successiouns,°
And nat eterne, withoute lie:
This maistow understonde and seen at eye.°
Lo the ook, that hath so long a norisshinge°
From time that it first biginneth springe,
And hath so long a lif, as we may see,
Yet at the laste wasted is the tree.
Considereth eek, how that the harde stoon
Under our feet, on which we trede and goon,
Yit wasteth it, as it lith° by the weye.
The brode river somtime wexeth° dreie.
The grete toures see we wane and wende.°
Than may ye see that al this thing hath ende.
Of man and womman seen we wel also,
That nedes, in oon of thise termes two,
This is to seyn, in youthe or elles age,
He moot° ben deed, the king as shal a page;
Som in his bed, som in the depe see,
Som in the large feeld,° as men may se;
Ther helpeth noght, al goth that ilke° weye.
Thanne may I seyn that al this thing moot° deie.
What maketh this but Jupiter the king?
The which is prince and cause of alle thing,
Converting° al unto his propre welle,°
From which it is derived, sooth to telle.
And hereagains no creature on live
Of no degree availleth° for to strive.
Thanne is it wisdom, as it thinketh me,
To maken vertu of necessitee,°
And take it wel that we may nat eschue,°
And namely° that to us alle is due.
And whoso gruccheth ought,° he dooth folie,
And rebel is to him that al may gie.°
And certeinly a man hath most honour
To dien in his excellence and flour,°
Whan he is siker° of his gode name;
Than hath he doon his freend, ne him, no shame.
And gladder oghte his freend ben of his deeth,
Whan with honour upyolden° is his breeth,
Than whan his name apalled° is for age;
For al forgeten is his vasselage.°
Than is it best, as for a worthy fame,
To dien whan that he is best of name.
The contrarie of al this is wilfulnesse.
Why grucchen° we? why have we hevinesse,
That good Arcite, of chivalrië flour
Departed is, with duetee° and honour,
Out of this foule prison of this lif?
Why grucchen heer his cosin and his wif
Of his welfare that° loved hem so weel?
Can he hem thank? nay, God wot, never a deel°
That bothe his soule and eek hemself offende,°
And yet they mowe° hir lustes° nat amende.
What may I conclude of this longe serie,°
But, after wo, I rede° us to be merie,°
And thanken Jupiter of al his grace?°
And, er that we departen from this place,
I rede° that we make, of sorwes two,
O parfit° joye, lasting evermo;
And loketh now, wher most sorwe is herinne,
Ther wol we first amenden and biginne.

¶“Suster,” quod he, “this is my fulle assent,
With al th’avis° heer of my parlement,
That gentil Palamon, your owne knight,
That serveth yow with wille, herte, and might,
And ever hath doon, sin that ye first him knewe,
That ye shul, of your grace, upon him rewe,°
And taken him for housbonde and for lord:
Leen° me your hond, for this is our acord.
Lat see now of your wommanly pitee.
He is a kinges brother sone, pardee;°
And, though° he were a povre bacheler,°
Sin he hath served yow so many a yeer,
And had for yow so greet adversitee,
It moste been considered, leveth° me;
For gentil mercy oghte to passen right.”°

¶Than seide he thus to Palamon ful right;°
“I trowe° ther nedeth litel sermoning°
To make yow assente to this thing.
Com neer, and tak your lady by the hond.”
Bitwixen hem was maad anon the bond,
That highte° matrimoine or mariage,
By al the counseil and the baronage.
And thus with alle blisse and melodie
Hath Palamon ywedded Emelie.
And God, that al this wide world hath wroght,
Sende him his love, that hath it dere aboght.°

¶For now is Palamon in alle wele,
Living in blisse, in richesse, and in hele;°
And Emelie him loveth so tendrely,
And he hir serveth also gentilly,
That never was ther no word hem bitwene
Of jelousie, or any other tene.°
Thus endeth Palamon and Emelie;
And God save al this faire companie!—Amen.
