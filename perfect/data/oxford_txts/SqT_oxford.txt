¶At Sarray, in the land of Tartarie,
Ther dwelte a king, that werreyed° Russie,
Thurgh which ther deide many a doughty man.
This noble king was cleped Cambinskan,
Which in his time was of so greet renoun
That ther nas nowher° in no regioun
So excellent a lord in alle thing;
Him lakked noght that longeth° to a king.
As of° the secte° of which that he was born
He kepte his lay,° to which that he was sworn;
And therto° he was hardy,° wis, and riche,
Pitous° and just, and evermore iliche°
Sooth° of his word, benigne and honurable,
Of his corage° as any centre stable;°
Yong, fresh, and strong, in armes desirous°
As any bacheler° of al his hous.
A fair persone he was and fortunat,
And kepte alwey so wel royal estat,°
That ther was nowher swich another man.

¶This noble king, this Tartre Cambinskan
Hadde two sones on° Elpheta his wif,
Of which the eldeste highte Algarsif,
That other son was cleped° Cambalo.
A doghter had this worthy king also,
That yongest was, and highte° Canacee.
But for to tel yow al hir beautee,
It lith° nat in my tonge, n’in° my conning;°
I dar nat undertak so heigh a thing.
Min English eek is insufficient;
It moste been° a rethor° excellent,
That coude° his colours° longing for° that art,
If he sholde hir discriven° every part.°
I am non swich,° I moot° speke as I can.

¶And so bifel° that, whan this Cambinskan
Hath twenty winter born° his diademe,
As he was wont° fro yeer to yeer, I deme,°
He leet° the feste of his nativitee°
Don crien° thurghout Sarray his citee,
The last Idus of March,° after° the yeer.
Phebus, the son, ful joly was and cleer;°
For he was neigh° his exaltacioun°
In Martes face,° and in his mansioun°
In Aries, the colerik° hote signe.
Ful lusty° was the weder and benigne,°
For which the foules, again° the sonne shene,°
What for the seson and the yonge grene,°
Ful loude songen° hir affecciouns;
Him semed° han geten hem° protecciouns
Again the swerd of winter kene and cold.

¶This Cambinskan, of which I have yow told,
In royal vestiment sit° on his deis,°
With diademe, ful heighe in his paleis,
And halt° his fest,° so solempne and so riche
That in this world ne was ther noon it liche.°
Of which if I shal tellen al th’array,°
Than wolde it occupie a someres day;
And eek it nedeth nat for to devise°
At every cours° the ordre of hir servise.
I wol nat tellen of hir strange° sewes,°
Ne of hir swannes, ne of hir heronsewes.°
Eek in that lond, as tellen knightes olde,
Ther is som mete° that is ful deintee° holde,°
That in this lond men recche of it but smal;°
Ther nis no° man that may reporten al.
I wol nat tarien° yow, for it is prime,°
And for it is no fruit° but los of time;
Unto my firste° I wol have my recours.

¶And so bifel that, after the thridde cours,
Whil that this king sit thus in his nobleie,°
Herkninge° his minstralles hir thinges° pleye
Biforn him at the bord° deliciously,°
In at the halle dore al sodeinly
Ther cam a knight upon a stede° of bras,
And in his hand a brood mirour of glas.
Upon his thombe he hadde of gold a ring,
And by his side a naked° swerd hanging;
And up he rideth to the heighe bord.
In al the hall ne was ther spoke a word
For merveille of this knight; him to biholde°
Ful bisily° they waiten° yonge and olde.
This strange knight, that cam thus sodeinly,
Al armed save his heed ful richely,
Saluëth° king and queen, and lordes alle,
By° ordre, as they seten° in the halle,
With so heigh reverence and obeisaunce
As wel in speche as in contenaunce,°
That Gawain, with his olde curteisie,
Though he were come agein out of Fairie,°
Ne coude him nat amende° with a word.
And after this, biforn the heighe bord,
He with a manly vois seith his message,
After the forme° used in his langage,
Withouten vice of° sillable or of lettre;
And, for° his tale sholde seme the bettre,
Accordant° to his wordes was his chere,°
As techeth art of speche hem that it lere;°
Albeit that° I can nat soune° his style,
Ne can nat climben over so heigh a stile,
Yet seye I this, as to commune entente,°
Thus muche amounteth al that ever° he mente,
If it so be that I have it in minde.

¶He seid, “The king of Arabe° and of Inde,°
My lige lord, on this solempne° day
Saluëth yow as he best can and may,
And sendeth yow, in honour of your feste,°
By me, that am al redy at your heste,°
This stede of bras, that esily and wel
Can, in the space of o° day naturel,°
This is to seyn, in foure and twenty houres,
Wherso yow list,° in droghte° or elles shoures,
Beren your body into every place
To which your herte wilneth° for to pace°
Withouten wem° of yow, thurgh foul or fair;
Or, if yow list to fleen° as hie in the air
As doth an egle, whan him list to sore,°
This same stede shal bere yow ever more
Withouten harm, til ye be ther° yow leste,°
Though that° ye slepen on his bak or reste;
And turne ayein, with writhing° of a pin.
He that it wroghte coud° ful many a gin;°
He waited° many a constellacioun
Er he had doon this operacioun°
And knew ful many a seel° and many a bond.°

¶“This mirour eek, that I have in min hond,
Hath swich a might,° that men may in it see
Whan ther shal fallen any adversitee
Unto your regne° or to yourself also;
And openly who is your freend or foo.
And over al° this, if any lady bright°
Hath set hir herte on any maner wight,°
If he be fals, she shal his treson see,
His newe love and al his subtiltee°
So openly, that ther shal no thing hide.
Wherfor, agein° this lusty° someres tide,°
This mirour and this ring, that ye may see,
He hath sent to my lady Canacee,
Your excellente doghter that is here.

¶“The vertu° of the ring, if ye wol here,
Is this; that, if hir lust it° for to were
Upon hir thombe, or in hir purs it bere,
Ther is no foul that fleeth° under the hevene
That she ne shal wel understonde his stevene,°
And knowe his mening openly and plein,°
And answere him in his langage agein.
And every gras that groweth up on rote°
She shal eek knowe, and whom it wol do bote,°
Al be his woundes never so° depe and wide.

¶“This naked swerd, that hangeth by my side,
Swich vertu° hath, that what man so° ye smite,°
Thurghout his armure it wol kerve° and bite,
Were it as thikke as is a branched ook;°
And what man that is wounded with the strook
Shal never be hool° til that yow list,° of grace,°
To stroke him with the platte° in thilke° place
Ther° he is hurt: this is as muche to seyn,
Ye mote with the platte swerd agein
Stroke° him in the wounde, and it wol close;
This is a verray sooth,° withouten glose,°
It failleth nat whil it is in your hold.”°

¶And whan this knight hath thus his tale told,
He rideth out of halle, and doun he lighte.°
His stede, which that shoon as sonne brighte,
Stant° in the court,° as stille as any stoon.
This knight is to his chambre lad anon,
And is unarmed° and unto mete° yset.°
The presentes ben ful royally yfet,°
This is to seyn, the swerd and the mirour,
And born anon° into the heighe tour
With certeine officers ordeined° therfore;°
And unto Canacee this ring was bore°
Solempnely, ther° she sit at the table.
But sikerly, withouten any fable,°
The hors of bras, that may nat be remewed,°
It stant as it were to the ground yglewed.°
Ther° may no man out of the place it drive°
For noon engin° of windas° or polive;°
And cause° why, for they can nat the craft.°
And therefore in the place they han it laft
Til that the knight hath taught hem the manere
To voiden° him, as ye shal after here.

¶Greet was the prees,° that swarmeth to and fro,
To gauren on° this hors that stondeth so;
For it so heigh was, and so brood and long,
So wel proporcioned for to ben strong,
Right as it were a stede of Lumbardie;
Therwith so horsly,° and so quik of eye
As it a gentil Poileis° courser° were.
For certes, fro his tail unto his ere,
Nature ne art ne coude him nat amende°
In no degree, as al the peple wende.°
But evermore hir° moste° wonder was,
How that it coude goon,° and was of bras;
It was of Fairie,° as the peple semed.°
Diverse folk diversely they demed;°
As many hedes, as many wittes° ther been.
They murmureden as dooth a swarm of been,°
And maden skiles° after° hir fantasies,°
Rehersinge of° thise olde poetries,°
And seiden, it was lik the Pegasee,°
The hors that hadde winges for to flee;°
Or elles it was the Grekes hors Sinon,°
That broghte Troye to destruccion,
As men may in thise olde gestes° rede,
“Min herte,” quod oon, “is evermore in drede;
I trowe som men of armes been therinne,
That shapen hem° this citee for to winne.
It were right good that al swich thing were knowe.”
Another rowned° to his felawe lowe,
And seide, “He lieth, it is rather lik
An apparence° ymaad by som magik,
As jogelours° pleyen at thise festes grete.”
Of sondry doutes° thus they jangle° and trete,°
As lewed° peple demeth° comunly
Of thinges that ben maad more subtilly°
Than they can in her lewednes° comprehende;
They demen° gladly° to the badder ende.°

¶And somme of hem wondred on the mirour,
That born was up into the maister tour,°
How men mighte in it swiche thinges see.
Another answerde, and seide it mighte wel be
Naturelly, by composiciouns°
Of angles and of slye° reflexiouns,
And seiden, that in Rome was swich oon.
They speken of Alocen° and Vitulon,°
And Aristotle, that writen° in hir lives
Of queinte° mirours and of prospectives,°
As knowen they that han hir bokes herd.

¶And othere folk han wondred on the swerd
That wolde percen thurghout everything;
And fille in speche° of Thelophus° the king,
And of Achilles with his queinte° spere,
For he coud with it bothe hele° and dere,°
Right in swich wise as men may with the swerd
Of which right now ye han yourselven herd.
They speken of sondry harding° of metal,
And speke of medicines° therwithal,°
And how, and whanne, it sholde yharded° be;
Which is unknowe algates° unto me.

¶Tho speke they of Canaceës ring,
And seiden al, that swich a wonder thing
Of craft of ringes° herd they never non,°
Save that he, Moises, and king Salomon
Hadde a name of° konning° in swich art.
Thus seyn the peple, and drawen hem apart.°
But nathelees, somme seiden that it was
Wonder° to maken of fern-asshen° glas,
And yet nis° glas nat lik asshen of fern;
But for° they° han yknowen it so fern,°
Therfore cesseth° her jangling and her wonder.
As sore° wondren somme on cause of thonder,
On ebbe, on flood,° on gossomer,° and on mist,
And alle thing, til that the cause is wist.°

¶Thus janglen° they and demen° and devise,°
Til that the king gan fro the bord° arise.
Phebus hath laft the angle meridional,°
And yet° ascending was the beest° royal,
The gentil Leon,° with his Aldiran,°
Whan that this Tartre king, this Cambinskan,
Roos fro his bord, ther that° he sat ful hie.
Toforn him° gooth the loude minstralcie,°
Til he cam to his chambre of parements,°
Ther as° they sownen° diverse instruments,
That it is lik an heven° for to here.
Now dauncen lusty° Venus° children dere,
For in the Fish° hir lady sat ful hie,
And loketh on hem with a freendly eye.
This noble king is set up in his trone.°
This strange° knight is fet° to him ful sone,
And on the daunce he gooth° with Canacee.
Heer is the revel° and the jolitee°
That is nat able a dul man to devise.°
He moste han knowen love and his° servise,
And been a festlich° man as fresh as May,
That sholde yow devisen swich array.°
Who coude telle yow the forme of daunces,
So uncouthe° and so fresshe contenaunces,°
Swich subtil loking and dissimulinges°
For drede of jalouse mennes aperceivinges?°
No man but Launcelot, and he is deed.
Therefor I passe of° al this lustiheed;°
I seye namore, but in this jolinesse
I lete° hem, til men to the soper dresse.°
The stiward bit° the spices for to hie,°
And eek the win, in al this melodie.
The usshers° and the squiers ben ygoon;
The spices and the win is come anoon.
They ete and drinke; and whan this hadde an ende,
Unto the temple, as reson was,° they wende.
The service doon, they soupen° al by day.°
What nedeth yow° rehercen° hir array?°
Ech man wot wel, that eche kinges feeste
Hath plentee,° to the moste° and to the leeste,
And deintees° mo than been in my knowing.

¶At after° soper gooth this noble king
To seen this hors of bras, with al the route°
Of lordes and of ladies him aboute.
Swich wondring was ther on this hors of bras
That, sin the grete sege of Troye was,
Theras° men wondreden on an hors also,
Ne was ther swich a wondring as was tho.°
But finally the king axeth this knight
The vertu° of this courser and the might,
And preyede him to telle his governaunce.°
This hors anoon bigan to trippe° and daunce,
Whan that this knight leid hand upon his° reine,
And seide, “Sir, ther is namore to seyne,
But, whan yow list° to riden anywhere,
Ye moten° trille° a pin, stant° in his ere,
Which I shall telle yow bitwix us two.
Ye mote nempne° him to what place also
Or to what contree that yow list° to ride.
And whan ye come ther as° yow list abide,°
Bidde him descende, and trille another pin,
For therin lith the effect° of al the gin,°
And he wol doun descende and doon your wille;
And in that place he wol abide stille,
Though al the world the contrarie hadde yswore;°
He shal nat thennes ben ydrawe° ne ybore.°
Or, if yow liste bidde him thennes° goon,
Trille this pin, and he wol vanishe anoon
Out of the sighte of every maner wight,°
And come again, be it by day or night,
When that yow list to clepen° him agein
In swich a gise° as I shal to yow seyn
Bitwixe yow and me, and that ful sone.
Ride whan yow list, ther is namore° to done.”
Enformed whan the king was of° that knight,
And hath conceived in his wit° aright
The maner and the forme of al this thing,
Thus glad and blithe, this noble doughty° king
Repeireth° to his revel as biforn.
The bridel is unto the tour yborn,°
And kept among his jewels° leve° and dere.
The hors vanisshed, I noot° in what manere,
Out of hir sighte; ye gete namore of me.
But thus I lete° in lust° and jolitee
This Cambinskan his lordes festeyinge,°
Til wel ny the day bigan to springe.°

¶The norice° of digestioun, the slepe,
Gan on hem winke,° and bad° hem taken kepe,°
That muchel° drink and labour wolde han reste;
And with a galping° mouth hem alle he keste,°
And seid, that it was time to lie adoun,
For blood was in his dominacioun;°
“Cherissheth blood, natures freend,” quod he.
They thanken him galping, by two, by three,
And every wight gan drawe° him to his reste,
As slepe hem bad; they toke it for the beste.
Hir dremes shul nat been ytold for° me;
Ful were hir hedes of fumositee,°
That causeth dreem, of which ther nis no° charge.°
They slepen til that it was prime large,°
The moste part, but it were° Canacee;
She was ful mesurable,° as wommen be.
For of hir fader had she take leve
To gon to reste, sone after it was eve;
Hir liste nat° appalled° for to be,
Nor on the morwe unfestlich° for to see;°
And slepte hir firste sleep, and thanne awook.
For swich a joy she in hir herte took
Both of hir queinte° ring and hir mirour,
That twenty time she changed hir colour;
And in hir slepe, right for° impressioun°
Of hir mirour, she hadde a visioun.

¶Wherfore,° er that° the sonne gan up glide,
She cleped° on hir maistresse° hir biside,
And seide, that hir liste for to rise.
Thise olde wommen that been gladly wise,°
As is hir maistresse, answerde hir anoon,°
And seide, “Madame, whider° wil ye goon
Thus erly? For the folk° ben alle on reste.”
“I wol,” quod she, “arise, for me leste°
No lenger for to slepe, and walke aboute.”
Hir maistresse clepeth° wommen a gret route,°
And up they risen, wel a° ten or twelve;
Up riseth fresshe° Canacee hirselve,
As rody° and bright as dooth° the yonge sonne,
That in the Ram° is four degrees upronne;°
Noon hyer° was he, whan she redy was;
And forth she walketh esily a pas,°
Arraied° after the lusty° seson sote°
Lightly, for to pleye and walke on fote;
Nat but with° five or six of hir meinee;°
And in a trench,° forth in the park, goth she.
The vapour,° which that fro the erthe glood,°
Made the son to seme rody° and brood;
But nathelees, it was so fair a sighte
That it made alle hir hertes for to lighte,°
What for° the seson and the morweninge,
And for the foules° that she herde singe;
For right anon she wiste what they mente
Right° by hir song, and knew al hir entente.°

¶The knotte,° why that every tale is told,
If it be taried° til that lust° be cold
Of hem that han it after herkned° yore,°
The savour° passeth° ever lenger the more,°
For fulsomnesse° of his prolixitee.°
And by the same reson thinketh me,°
I sholde to the knotte condescende,°
And maken of hir walking sone an ende.

¶Amidde° a tree for drie,° as whit as chalk,
As Canacee was pleying in hir walk,
Ther sat a faucon over hir heed ful hie,
That with a pitous vois so gan to crie°
That all the wode resouned of° hir cry.
Ybeten hath she hirself so pitously
With bothe hir winges, til the rede blood
Ran endelong° the tree theras° she stood.°
And ever in oon° she cride alwey and shrighte,°
And with hir beek hirselven so she prighte,°
That ther nis° tigre, ne noon so cruel beste,
That dwelleth either in wode or in foreste
That nolde° han wept, if that he wepe coude,
For sorwe of hir, she shrighte alwey so loude.
For ther nas never yet no man on live°—
If that I coude a faucon wel discrive—
That herde of swich another of fairnesse,
As wel of plumage as of gentillesse°
Of shap, and al that mighte yrekened° be.
A faucon peregrin° than semed she
Of fremde° land; and evermore, as she stood,
She swowneth now and now° for lakke of blood,
Til wel neigh is she fallen fro the tree.

¶This faire kinges doghter, Canacee,
That on hir finger bar the queinte° ring,
Thurgh which she understood wel every thing
That any foul may in his ledene° seyn,
And coude answere him in his ledene agein,
Hath understonde what this faucon seide,
And wel neigh for the rewthe° almost she deide.
And to the tree she gooth ful hastily,
And on this faucon loketh pitously,°
And heeld hir lappe abrood,° for wel she wiste
The faucon moste fallen fro the twiste,°
When that it swowned next, for lakke of blood.
A longe while to waiten° hir she stood
Till atte laste she spak in this manere
Unto the hauk, as ye shul after here.

¶“What is the cause, if it be for to telle,
That ye be in this furial° pine° of helle?”
Quod Canacee unto this hauk above.
“Is this for sorwe of deeth or los of love?
For, as I trowe, thise ben causes two
That causen moost a gentil° herte wo;
Of other harm it nedeth nat° to speke.
For ye yourself upon yourself yow wreke,°
Which proveth wel, that either love or drede°
Mot been encheson° of your cruel dede,
Sin that I see non other wight yow chace.°
For love of God, as dooth yourselven grace°
Or what may ben your help; for west nor eest°
Ne sey I never er now no brid° ne beest
That ferde° with° himself so pitously.°
Ye sle me with your sorwe, verraily;
I have of yow so gret compassioun.
For Goddes love, com fro the tree adoun;
And, as I am a kinges doghter trewe,
If that I verraily° the cause knewe
Of your disese,° if it lay in my might,
I wolde amende° it, er that it were night,
As wisly helpe me gret God of kinde!°
And herbes shal I right ynowe yfinde°
To hele with your hurtes hastily.”

¶Tho shright° this faucon more pitously°
Than ever she dide, and fil to grounde anoon,
And lith aswowne,° deed, and lik a stoon,
Til Canacee hath in hir lappe hir take
Unto the time° she gan of swough° awake.
And, after that she of hir swough gan breide,°
Right in hir haukes ledene° thus she seide:—

¶“That pitee renneth sone° in gentil herte,
Feling° his similitude° in peines smerte,°
Is preved alday,° as men may it see,
As wel by werk° as by auctoritee;°
For gentil herte kitheth° gentillesse.°
I see wel, that ye han of my distresse
Compassioun, my faire Canacee,
Of verray° wommanly benignitee°
That nature in your principles hath set.
But for non hope° for to fare the bet,°
But for to obeye unto your herte free,°
And for to maken othere ywar by° me,
As by the whelpe° chasted° is the leoun,
Right for that cause and that conclusioun,°
Whil that I have a leiser° and a space,°
Min harm° I wol confessen, er I pace.”°
And ever, whil that oon hir sorwe tolde,
That other weep, as° she to water wolde,°
Til that the faucon bad hir to be stille;
And, with a sik,° right thus she seide hir wille.
“Ther° I was bred (allas! that harde day!)
And fostred° in a roche of marbul gray
So tendrely, that nothing eiled° me,
I niste nat° what was adversitee,
Til I coud flee° ful hie under the sky.
Tho dwelte a tercelet° me faste by,
That semed welle° of alle gentillesse;°
Al were he° ful of treson and falsnesse,
It was so wrapped under humble chere,°
And under hewe° of trouthe in swich manere,
Under plesance, and under bisy° peine,
That no wight coude han wend° he coude feine,°
So depe in grein° he dyed his coloures.
Right° as a serpent hit him° under floures
Til he may seen his time for to bite,
Right so this God of love, this ypocrite,
Doth so his cerimonies° and obeisaunces,°
And kepeth in semblant° alle his observances°
That sowneth into° gentillesse of love.
As in a toumbe is al the faire° above,
And under is the corps,° swich as ye woot,
Swich was this ypocrite, both cold and hoot,
And in this wise he served his entente,°
That (save the feend) non wiste what he mente.
Til he so longe had wopen and compleined,°
And many a yeer his service to me feined,°
Til that min hert, to pitous° and to nice,°
Al innocent of his crouned° malice,
Forfered° of his deeth, as thoughte me,°
Upon his othes and his seuretee,°
Graunted him love, on this condicioun,
That evermore min honour and renoun
Were saved,° bothe privee° and apert;°
This is to seyn, that, after° his desert,°
I yaf him al min herte and al my thoght—
God woot and he, that otherwise noght—
And took his herte in chaunge° for min for ay.

¶“But sooth is seid, gon sithen many a day,°
‘A trew wight° and a theef thenken nat oon.’°
And, whan he saugh the thing so fer ygoon,
That I had graunted him fully my love,
In swich a gise° as I have seid above,
And yeven° him my trewe herte, as free°
As he swoor he his herte yaf to me;
Anon this tigre, ful of doublenesse,
Fil on his knees with so devout humblesse,°
With so heigh° reverence, and, as by his chere,°
So lik a gentil° lovere of manere,
So ravisshed,° as it semed, for the joye,
That never Jason, ne Paris of Troye,
Jason? certes, ne non other man,
Sin Lameth was, that alderfirst° bigan
To loven two, as writen folk biforn,
Ne never, sin the firste man was born,
Ne coude man, by twenty thousand part,
Countrefete° the sophimes° of his art;
Ne were worthy unbokele° his galoche,°
Ther° doublenesse or feining sholde approche,°
Ne so coude thanke° a wight as he did me!
His maner was an heven for to see
Til° any womman, were she never so° wis;
So peinted° he and kembde° at point devis°
As wel his wordes as his contenaunce.
And I so lovede him for his obeisaunce,°
And for the trouthe° I demed° in his herte,
That, if so were that any thing him smerte,°
Al were it° never so lite,° and I it wiste,
Me thoughte, I felte deeth min herte twiste.°
And shortly, so ferforth° this thing is went,°
That my wil was his willes instrument;
This is to seyn, my wil obeyed his wil
In alle thing, as fer as reson fil,°
Keping the boundes of my worship° ever.
Ne never hadde I thing so leef,° ne lever,°
As him, God woot! ne never shal namo.°

¶“This lasteth lenger than a yeer or two,
That I supposed of him noght° but good.
But finally, thus atte laste it stood,
That fortune wolde that he moste twinne°
Out of that place which that I was inne.
Wher° me was wo,° that is no questioun;
I can nat make of it discripcioun;
For o° thing dar I tellen boldely,
I knowe what is the peine of deth therby;°
Swich harm I felt for° he ne might bileve.°
So on a day° of me he took his leve,
So sorwefully eek, that I wend verraily°
That he had felt as muche harm as I,
Whan that I herde him speke, and saugh his hewe.°
But nathelees, I thoughte he was so trewe,
And eek that he repaire° sholde agein
Withinne a litel while, sooth to seyn;
And reson wolde° eek that he moste go
For his honour, as ofte it happeth° so,
That I made vertu° of necessitee,°
And took it wel, sin that it moste be.
As I best mighte,° I hidde fro him my sorwe,
And took him by the hond, Seint John to borwe,°
And seide him° thus: ‘Lo, I am youres al;
Beth swich as I to yow have been, and shal.’
What he answerde, it nedeth noght° reherce,°
Who can sey bet than he, who can do werse?
Whan he hath al wel seid, thanne hath he doon.
‘Therfor bihoveth him° a ful long spoon
That shal ete with a feend,’ thus herde I seye.°

¶So atte laste he moste forth his weye,°
And forth he fleeth, til he cam ther° him leste°
Whan it cam him to purpos° for to reste.
I trowe he hadde thilke text in minde,
That ‘Alle thing, repairing° to his kinde,°
Gladeth himself’; thus seyn men, as I gesse;
Men loven of propre kind° newfangelnesse,°
As briddes doon that men in cages fede.
For though thou night and day take of hem hede,
And strawe° hir cage faire and softe as silk,
And yeve hem sugre, hony, breed and milk,
Yet right anon,° as that his dore is uppe,°
He with his feet wol spurne° adoun his cuppe,
And to the wode° he wol° and wormes ete;
So newefangel° been they of hir mete,°
And loven novelries° of propre kinde;
No gentillesse of blood ne may hem binde.
So ferd° this tercelet, allas the day!
Though he were gentil born,° and fresh and gay,°
And goodly for to seen, and humble and free,°
He saugh upon a time a kite flee,°
And sodeinly he loved this kite° so,
That al his love is clene° fro me ago,°
And hath his trouthe° falsed° in this wise;
Thus hath the kite my love in hir servise,
And I am lorn° withouten remedie!”
And with that word this faucon gan to crie,
And swowned eft in Canaceës barme.°

¶Greet was the sorwe, for the haukes harme,
That Canacee and alle hir wommen made;
They niste° how they might the faucon glade.°
But Canacee hom bereth hir in hir lappe,
And softely in plastres° gan hir wrappe,
Ther as° she with hir beek had hurt hirselve.
Now can nat Canacee but° herbes delve°
Out of the grounde, and make salves° newe
Of herbes precious, and fine° of hewe,°
To helen° with this hauk; fro day to night
She dooth hir bisinesse° and al hir might.
And by hir beddes heed she made a mewe,°
And covered it with velvettes° blewe,
In signe of trouthe that is in wommen sene.
And al without,° the mewe is peinted grene,
In which were peinted al thise false foules,°
As beth thise tidifs,° tercelets, and oules,
And pyes,° on hem for to crie and chide.°
Right for despit were peinted hem biside.

¶Thus lete° I Canacee hir hauk keping;°
I wol namore as now° speke of hir ring,
Til it come eft° to purpos° for to seyn
How that this faucon gat hir love agein
Repentant, as the storie telleth us,
By mediacioun of Cambalus,
The kinges sone, of whiche I yow tolde.
But hennesforth° I wol my proces° holde
To speke of aventures and of batailles,
That never yet was herd so° grete mervailles.
First wol I telle yow of Cambinskan,
That in his time many a citee wan;°
And after wol I speke of Algarsif,
How that he wan Theodora to his wif,°
For whom ful ofte in greet peril he was,
Ne hadde he ben° holpen° by the stede of bras;
And after wol I speke of Cambalo,
That faught in listes° with the bretheren two
For Canacee, er that he mighte hir winne.
And ther° I lefte° I wol agein biginne.

¶Appollo whirleth up his char° so hye,
Til that° the god Mercurius hous° the slye°—
