¶Whilom° ther was dwellinge in Lumbardie
A worthy knight, that born was of Pavie,
In which° he lived in greet prosperitee;
And sixty yeer a wiflees man was he,
And folwed ay his bodily delit°
On wommen, theras° was his appetit,
As doon thise foles° that ben seculeer.°
And whan that he was passed sixty yeer,
Were it° for holinesse or for dotage,°
I can nat sey, but swich a greet corage°
Had this knight to been a wedded man,
That day and night he dooth al that he can
T’espien° where he mighte wedded be;
Preyinge° our Lord to granten him, that he
Mighte ones° knowe of thilke° blisful lif
That is bitwixe an housbond and his wif;
And for to live under that holy bond
With which that first God man and womman bond°
“Non other lif,” seide he, “is worth a bene;°
For wedlok is so esy° and so clene,°
That in this world it is a paradis.”

¶Thus seid this olde knight, that was so wis.°
And certeinly, as sooth° as God is king,
To take a wif, it is a glorious thing,
And namely whan a man is old and hoor;°
Thanne is a wif the fruit° of his tresor.
Than sholde he take a yong wif and a feir,
On which he mighte engendren° him an heir,
And lede his lif in joye and in solas,°
Wheras° thise bacheleres singe “Allas,”
Whan that they finden any adversitee
In love, which nis° but childish vanitee.
And trewely it sit° wel to be so,
That bacheleres have often peine and wo;
On brotel° ground they builde, and brotelnesse
They finde, whan they wene° sikernesse.°
They live but as a brid° or as a beste,
In libertee, and under non areste,°
Theras° a wedded man in his estaat°
Liveth a lif blisful and ordinaat,°
Under this yok of mariage ybounde;°
Wel may his herte in joye and blisse habounde.°

¶For who can be so buxom° as a wif?
Who is so trewe, and eek so ententif°
To kepe him, sik and hool,° as is his make?°
For wele or wo,° she wol him nat forsake.°
She nis nat° wery° him to love and serve,
Thogh that he lie bedrede° til he sterve.°

¶And yet som clerkes seyn, it nis nat so,
Of whiche he, Theofraste, is oon of tho.°
What force° though Theofraste liste° lie?
“Ne take no wif,” quod he, “for housbondrie,°
As for to spare in houshold thy dispence;°
A trewe servant dooth more diligence,°
Thy good° to kepe,° than thin owene wif.
For she wol claime half part al hir lif;
And if that thou be sik, so God me save,°
Thy verrai° frendes or a trewe knave°
Wol kepe thee bet° than she that waiteth ay°
After thy good,° and hath don many a day.
And if thou take a wif unto thin hold,°
Ful lightly° maystow° been a cokewold.”°
This sentence, and an hundred thinges worse,
Writeth this man, ther° God his bones corse!°

¶But take no kepe of° al swich vanitee;
Deffye Theofraste and herke° me.
A wif is Goddes yifte° verraily;
Alle other maner yiftes hardily,
As londes, rentes,° pasture,° or commune,°
Or moebles,° al ben yiftes of fortune,
That passen as a shadwe upon a wal.
But dredelees,° if pleinly speke I shal,
A wif wol laste, and in thin hous endure,
Wel lenger than thee list,° paraventure.°
Mariage is a ful gret° sacrement;
He which that° hath no wif, I holde him shent;°
He liveth helplees and al desolat,
I speke of folk in seculer estaat.°
And herke why, I sey nat this for noght,
That womman is for mannes help ywroght.°
The hye God, whan he hadde Adam maked,
And saugh him al allone, bely-naked,°
God of° his grete goodness seide than,
“Lat us now make an help° unto this man
Lik° to himself”; and thanne he made him° Eve.
Heer may ye se, and heerby may ye preve,°
That wif is mannes help and his confort,
His paradis terrestre° and his disport.°
So buxom° and so vertuous is she,
They moste nedes° live in unitee.
O° flesh they been, and o flesh, as I gesse,
Hath but on herte, in wele° and in distresse.°

¶A wif! a! Seinte Marie, benedicite!°
How mighte a man han any adversitee
That° hath a wif? certes, I can nat seye.
The blisse which that is bitwixe hem tweye°
Ther may no tonge° telle, or herte thinke.
If he be povre,° she helpeth him to swinke;°
She kepeth° his good,° and wasteth never a deel;°
Al that hir housbonde lust,° hir liketh° weel;°
She seith not ones “nay,” whan he seith “ye.”
“Do this,” seith he; “Al redy, sir,” seith she.
O blisful ordre of wedlok precious,
Thou art so mery,° and eek so vertuous,
And so commended° and appreved eek,
That every man that halt him° worth a leek,
Upon his bare knees oghte al his lif
Thanken° his God that him hath sent a wif;
Or elles° prey to God him for to sende
A wif, to laste unto his lives ende.
For thanne his lif is set in sikernesse;°
He may nat be deceived, as I gesse,
So that° he werke after° his wives reed;°
Than may he boldly kepen up° his heed,
They been so trewe and therwithal° so wise;
For which, if thou wolt werken° as the wise,°
Do alwey° so as° wommen wol thee rede.°

¶Lo, how that Jacob, as thise clerkes rede,°
By good conseil of his moder° Rebekke,
Bond° the kides skin aboute his nekke;
Thurgh which his fadres benisoun° he wan.°
Lo, Judith, as the storie eek telle can,
By wis conseil she Goddes peple kepte,°
And slow° him, Olofernus, whil he slepte.
Lo Abigail, by good conseil how she
Saved hir housbond Nabal, whan that° he
Sholde han be slain; and loke,° Ester also
By good conseil delivered out of° wo
The peple of God, and made him, Mardochee,°
Of° Assuere enhaunced° for to be.

¶Ther nis no° thing in gree superlatif,°
As seith Senek,° above an humble wif.
Suffre° thy wives tonge, as Caton° bit;°
She shal comande, and thou shalt suffren° it;
And yet she wol obeie of° curteisie.
A wif is keper of thin housbondrie;°
Wel may the sike° man biwaille° and wepe,
Theras° ther nis no° wif the hous to kepe.
I warne thee, if wisly thou wolt wirche,°
Love wel thy wif, as Crist loveth his chirche.
If thou lovest thyself, thou lovest thy wif;
No man hateth his flesh, but in his lif
He fostreth° it, and therfor bidde° I thee,
Cherisse thy wif, or thou shalt never thee.°

¶Housbond and wif, what so men jape° or pleye,
Of° worldly folk holden the siker° weye;
They been so knit,° ther may noon harm bitide;°
And namely, upon the wives side.

¶For which this Januarie, of whom I tolde,
Considered hath, inwith° his dayes olde,
The lusty° lif, the vertuous quiete,
That is in mariage hony-swete;
And for his freendes on a day° he sente,
To tellen hem th’effect° of his entente.°
With face sad,° his tale he hath hem told;
He seide, “Freendes, I am hoor and old,
And almost, God wot,° on my pittes° brinke;
Upon my soule somwhat moste I thinke.
I have my body folily° despended;°
Blessed be God, that it shal been amended!
For I wol be, certein, a wedded man,
And that anoon° in al the haste I can,
Unto som maide fair and tendre of age.
I prey yow, shapeth° for my mariage
Al sodeinly, for I wol nat abide;°
And I wol fond t’espien,° on my side,°
To whom I may be wedded hastily.
But forasmuche° as ye ben mo° than I,
Ye shullen rather° swich a thing espien
Than I, and wher me best were° to allien.°
But o thing warne I yow, my freendes dere,
I wol non old wif han in no manere.°
She shal nat passe twenty yeer, certain;
Old fish and yong flesh wolde I have ful fain.°
Bet° is,” quod he, “a pike than a pikerel;°
And bet than old boef is the tendre veel.°
I wol° no womman thritty yeer of age,
It is but benestraw° and greet forage.°
And eek thise olde widwes, God it woot,°
They can° so muchel craft° on Wades boot,°
So muchel broken harm,° whan that hem leste,°
That with hem sholde I never live in reste.
For sondry° scoles maken sotil° clerkis;
Womman of manie scoles° half a clerk is.°
But certeinly, a yong thing may men gie,°
Right as men may warm wex with handes plie.°
Wherfore I sey yow pleinly, in a clause,°
I wol non old wif han right for this cause.°
For if so were, I hadde swich mischaunce,°
That I in hir ne coude° han no plesaunce,°
Than sholde I lede my lif in avoutrie,°
And go streight to the devel whan I die.
Ne children sholde I none upon hir geten;°
Yet were me lever° houndes had me eten,
Than that min heritage sholde falle
In straunge hand, and this I tell yow alle.
I dote° nat, I woot° the cause why
Men sholde wedde, and forthermore wot I,
Ther speketh many a man of mariage,
That woot namore of it than woot my page,°
For whiche causes man shold take a wif.
If he ne may nat liven chast his lif,°
Take him° a wif with greet devocioun,
By cause of leveful° procreacioun
Of children, to th’onour of God above,
And nat only for paramour° or love;
And for they sholde lecherie eschue,°
And yelde° hir dettes° whan that they ben due;
Or for that ech of hem shold helpen other
In meschief,° as a suster shal the brother;
And live in chastitee ful holily.°
But sires, by your leve, that am nat I.
For God be thanked, I dar make avaunt,°
I fele my limes° stark° and suffisaunt
To do al that a man bilongeth to;°
I woot myselven best what I may do.
Though I be hoor,° I fare as dooth° a tree
That blosmeth er° that fruit ywoxen be;°
A blosmy tree° nis neither drie ne deed.
I fele me nowher hoor but on min heed;
Min herte and my limes been as grene
As laurer° thurgh the yeer is for to sene.
And sin that ye han herd al min entente,°
I prey yow to my wil ye wole assente.”

¶Diverse men diversely him tolde
Of mariage manie ensamples olde.
Somme blamed it, somme preised it, certein;°
But atte laste, shortly for to seyn,
As al day° falleth° altercacioun
Bitwixen freendes in disputisoun,°
Ther fil a strif° bitwixe his bretheren° two,
Of which that oon was cleped° Placebo,
Justinus soothly° called was that other.

¶Placebo seide, “O Januarie, brother,
Ful litel nede° had ye, my lord so dere,
Conseil to axe° of any that is here;
But that° ye been so ful of sapience,°
That yow ne liketh,° for° your heigh prudence,
To weiven° fro the word of Salomon.
This word seide he unto us everichon:°
‘Wirk° alle thing by conseil,’ thus seide he,
‘And thanne shaltow nat° repente thee.’
But though that Salomon spak swich a word,
Min owene dere brother and my lord,
So wisly° God my soule bringe at reste,
I hold° your owene conseil is the beste.
For brother min, of me tak this motif,°
I have now been a court man° al my lif.
And God it woot, though I unworthy be,
I have stonden in ful greet degree°
Abouten° lordes of ful heigh estaat;°
Yet hadde I never with noon of hem debaat.°
I never hem contraried,° trewely;
I woot wel that my lord can° more than I.
What that° he seith, I holde it° ferme and stable;
I sey the same, or elles thing semblable.°
A ful° gret fool is any conseillour,
That serveth any lord of heigh honour,
That dar presume, or elles thenken° it,
That his conseil shold passe° his lordes wit.°
Nay, lordes been no foles,° by my fay;°
Ye han yourselven shewed° heer today
So heigh sentence,° so holily° and weel
That I consente and conferme every deel°
Your wordes alle, and your opinioun.
By God, ther nis no° man in al this toun
N’in° al° Itaille, that coude bet° han said;
Crist halt him° of this conseil wel apaid.°
And trewely, it is an heigh corage°
Of any man, that stapen° is in age,
To take a yong wif; by my fader° kin,
Your herte hangeth on a joly pin.°
Doth now in this matere right as yow leste,°
For finally I holde° it for the beste.”

¶Justinus, that ay° stille sat and herde,°
Right in this wise° to Placebo answerde:
“Now brother min, be pacient, I preye,
Sin ye han seid,° and herkneth° what I seye.
Senek° among his othere wordes wise
Seith, that a man oghte him right wel avise,°
To whom he yeveth° his lond or his catel.°
And sin I oghte avise me right wel
To whom I yeve my good° awey fro me,
Wel muchel° more I oghte avised be
To whom I yeve my body; for alwey
I warn yow wel it is no childes pley
To take a wif withoute avisement.°
Men moste° enquere, this is min assent,°
Wher° she be wis,° or sobre, or dronkelewe,°
Or proud, or elles otherweys° a shrewe;°
A chidester,° or wastour of thy good,
Or° riche, or poore, or elles mannish° wood.°
Albeit so that no man finden shal
Noon in this world that trotteth° hool° in al,
Ne man ne° beest, swich as men coud devise;
But nathelees, it oghte ynough suffise°
With any wif, if so were that she° hadde
Mo gode thewes° than hir vices badde;
And al this axeth° leiser° for t’enquere.°
For God it woot, I have wept many a tere
Ful prively,° sin I have had a wif.
Preise whoso wole° a wedded mannes lif,
Certein, I finde in it but cost° and care,°
And observances,° of al blisses bare.°
And yet, God woot, my neighebores aboute,
And namely° of wommen many a route,°
Seyn that I have the moste stedefast° wif,
And eek the mekeste oon that bereth lif.°
But I wot best wher wringeth° me my sho.°
Ye mowe, for me, right as° yow liketh do;°
Aviseth yow,° ye been a man of age,
How that ye entren into mariage,
And namely° with a yong wif and a fair.
By him° that made water, erthe, and air,
The yongest man that is in al this route°
Is bisy ynogh to bringen it aboute
To han his wif allone,° trusteth me.
Ye shul nat plese hir fully yeres three,°
This is to seyn, to doon hir ful plesaunce.°
A wif axeth° ful many an observaunce.°
I prey yow that ye be nat ivel apaid.”°

¶“Wel,” quod this Januarie, “and hastow said?°
Straw for° thy Senek,° and for thy proverbes,
I counte° nat a panier° ful of herbes°
Of scole-termes;° wiser men than thow,
As thou hast herd, assenteden° right now
To my purpos; Placebo, what sey ye?”
“I seye, it is a cursed man,” quod he,
“That letteth° matrimoine, sikerly.”°
And with that word they risen° sodeinly,°
And been assented° fully, that he sholde
Be wedded whanne him list° and wher° he wolde.

¶Heigh fantasie° and curious bisinesse°
Fro day to day gan in the soule impresse°
Of Januarie aboute his mariage.
Many fair shap,° and many a fair visage°
Ther passeth thurgh his herte, night by night.
As whoso° toke a mirour polished bright,
And sette it in a commune° market-place,
Than sholde he see many a figure pace°
By his mirour; and, in the same wise,°
Gan Januarie inwith° his thoght devise°
Of maidens, whiche that° dwelten him biside.°
He wiste° nat wher that he mighte abide.°
For if that oon° have beaute in hir face,
Another stant° so in the peples grace°
For hir sadnesse,° and hir benignitee,°
That of the peple grettest vois° hath she.
And somme were riche, and hadden badde name.°

¶But nathelees, bitwixe ernest° and game,°
He atte laste apointed him° on oon,
And leet alle other° from his herte goon,
And chees° hir of° his owene auctoritee;
For love is blind al day,° and may nat see.
And whan that he was in° his bed ybroght,°
He purtreied,° in his herte and in his thoght,
Hir fresshe beautee and hir age tendre,
Hir middel° smal, hir armes longe and sclendre,°
Hir wise governaunce,° hir gentillesse,°
Hir wommanly beringe and hir sadnesse.°
And whan that he on hir was condescended,°
Him thoughte his chois ne might nat ben amended.°
For whan that° he himself concluded hadde,
Him thoughte ech° other mannes wit° so badde,
That inpossible it were to replie
Again° his chois, this was his fantasie.°

¶His freendes sente he to° at his instaunce,°
And preyed hem to doon him that plesaunce,°
That hastily they wolden to him come;
He wolde abregge° hir labour, alle and some.°
Nedeth namore° for him° to go° ne ride,
He was apointed° ther he wolde abide.°
Placebo cam, and eek his freendes sone,
And alderfirst° he bad° hem alle a bone,°
That noon of hem none argumentes make
Again the purpos which that he hath take;°
“Which purpos was plesant to God,” seide he,
“And verray° ground of his prosperitee.”
He seid, ther was a maiden in the toun,
Which that° of beautee hadde greet renoun,
Al were it so° she were of smal degree;°
Suffiseth him° hir youthe and hir beautee.
Which maide, he seide, he wolde han to his wif,°
To lede in ese° and holinesse his lif.
And thanked God, that he mighte han hire al,°
That no wight of his blisse parten° shal.
And preide hem° to labouren in this nede,°
And shapen° that he faille nat to spede;°
For thanne, he seide, his spirit was at ese.
“Thanne is,” quod he, “no thing may me displese,
Saue o° thing priketh in° my conscience,
The which° I wol reherce° in your presence.
I have,” quod he, “herd seid, ful yore ago,°
Ther may no man han parfit° blisses two,
This is to seye, in erthe and eek° in hevene.
For though he kepe him fro the sinnes sevene,
And eek from every branche of thilke° tree,
Yet is ther so parfit felicitee,
And so greet ese° and lust° in mariage,
That ever I am agast,° now in min age,°
That I shal lede now so mery° a lif,
So delicat,° withouten wo and strif,
That I shal have min hevene in erthe here.
For sith that verray° hevene is boght so dere,
With tribulacioun and greet penaunce,°
How sholde I thanne, that live° in swich plesaunce
As alle wedded men don with hir wivis,
Come to the blisse ther° Crist eterne on live° is?
This is my drede,° and ye, my bretheren tweye,
Assoilleth me° this questioun, I preye.”

¶Justinus, which that hated his folie,°
Answerde anon right° in his japerie;°
And for° he wolde his longe tale abregge,°
He wolde noon auctoritee allegge,°
But seide, “Sire, so° ther be noon obstacle
Other than this, God of° his hie miracle°
And of° his mercy may so for yow wirche,
That, er° ye have your right° of holy chirche,
Ye may repente of wedded mannes lif,
In which ye seyn ther is no wo ne strif.
And elles,° God forbede but he sente°
A wedded man him grace to repente
Wel ofte rather than a sengle° man!
And therfor, sire, the beste reed° I can,°
Dispeire yow noght, but have in your memorie,
Paraunter° she may be your purgatorie!
She may be Goddes mene,° and Goddes whippe;
Than shal your soule up to hevene skippe
Swifter than dooth an arwe out of the bowe!
I hope to God, herafter shul ye knowe,°
That there nis no° so greet felicitee
In mariage, ne never mo° shal be,
That yow shal lette° of your savacioun,
So that° ye use,° as skile is° and resoun,°
The lustes° of your wif attemprely,°
And that ye plese hir nat to amorously,
And that ye kepe yow eek from other sinne.
My tale° is done:—for my wit is thinne.°
Beth nat agast° herof,° my brother dere”—
(But lat us waden out of° this matere.°
The Wif of Bathe, if ye han understonde,
Of mariage, which we have on honde,°
Declared° hath ful wel in litel space°).
“Fareth now wel,° God have yow in his grace.”°

¶And with this word this Justin and his brother
Han take hir leve,° and ech of hem of other.°
For whan they sawe it moste nedes be,°
They wroghten° so, by sly° and wis tretee,°
That she, this maiden, which that Maius° highte,°
As hastily° as ever that she mighte,
Shal wedded be unto this Januarie.
I trowe° it were to longe yow to tarie,°
If I yow tolde of every scrit° and bond,°
By which that she was feffed in° his lond;
Or for to herknen of° hir riche array.°
But finally ycomen is the day
That to the chirche bothe be they went
For to receive the holy sacrement.
Forth comth° the preest, with stole° aboute his nekke,
And bad hir be lik Sarra and Rebekke,
In wisdom and in trouthe° of mariage;
And seide his orisons,° as is usage,°
And crouched hem,° and bad God sholde hem blesse,
And made al siker ynogh° with holinesse.
Thus been they wedded with solempnitee,°
And at the feste° sitteth he and she
With other worthy folk upon the deys.°
Al ful of joye and blisse is the paleis,
And ful of instruments° and of vitaille,°
The moste deinteuous° of al Itaille.
Biforn hem stood swiche instruments of soun,
That Orpheus, ne° of Thebes Amphioun,
Ne maden never swich a melodie.
At every cours than cam loud minstralcie,°
That never tromped° Joab, for to here,
Nor he, Theodomas, yet half so clere,
At Thebes, whan the citee was in doute.°
Bacus the win hem skinketh° al aboute,
And Venus laugheth° upon every wight.
For Januarie was bicome hir knight,
And wolde bothe assayen° his corage°
In libertee,° and eek in mariage;
And with hir firbrond° in hir hand aboute
Daunceth biforn the bride and al the route.°
And certeinly, I dar right wel seyn this,
Ymenëus, that God of wedding is,
Saugh never his lif° so mery a wedded man.
Hold thou thy pees,° thou poet Marcian,
That writest us that ilke° wedding murie°
Of hir, Philologie, and him, Mercurie
And of the songes that the Muses songe.°
To smal is bothe thy penne, and eek thy tonge,
For to descriven° of this mariage.
Whan tendre youthe hath wedded stouping° age,
Ther is swich mirthe that it may nat be writen;
Assayeth° it yourself, than may ye witen°
If that I lie or noon° in this matere.

¶Maius, that sit with so benigne a chere,°
Hir to biholde it semed faiërië;°
Quene Ester loked never with swich an eye
On Assuer, so meke a look hath she.
I may yow nat devise° al hir beautee;
But thus muche of hir beautee telle I may,
That she was lik the brighte morwe° of May,
Fulfild of alle beautee and plesaunce.
This Januarie is ravisshed° in a traunce
At every time he loked on hir face;
But in his herte he gan hir to manace,°
That he that night in armes wolde hir streine°
Harder than ever Paris dide Eleyne.
But nathelees, yet hadde he greet pitee,°
That thilke night offenden° hir moste° he;
And thoughte, “Allas! O tendre creature!
Now wolde God ye mighte wel endure
Al my corage,° it is so sharp and kene;
I am agast° ye shul it nat sustene.°
But God forbede that I dide al my might!°
Now wolde God that it were woxen night,°
And that the night wold lasten evermo.
I wold that al this° peple were ago.”°
And finally, he doth al his labour,°
As he best mighte, savinge° his honour,
To haste hem fro the mete° in subtil wise.°

¶The time cam that reson was° to rise;°
And after that, men daunce and drinken faste,°
And spices al about the hous they caste;°
And ful of joye and blisse is every man;
All but a squier, highte° Damian,
Which carf° biforn the knight ful many a day.
He was so ravisshed on° his lady May,
That for the verray° peine he was ny wood;°
Almost he swelte° and swowned ther° he stood.
So sore° hath Venus hurt him with hir brond,°
As that° she bar° it daunsinge in hir hond.
And to his bed he wente him hastily;
Namore of him as at this time speke I.
But ther I lete him° wepe ynough and pleine,
Til fresshe May wol rewen° on his peine.

¶O perilous fir, that in the bedstraw° bredeth!
O famulier foo,° that his service bedeth!°
O servant traitour, false hoomly° hewe,°
Lik to the naddre° in bosom sly untrewe,°
God shilde us° alle from your aqueintaunce!
O Januarie, dronken in plesaunce°
Of mariage, see how thy Damian,
Thin owene squier and thy borne man,°
Entendeth° for to do thee vileinie.°
God graunte thee thin hoomly fo t’espie.°
For in this world nis° worse pestilence
Than hoomly foo al day in thy presence.

¶Parfourned hath the sonne his ark diurne,°
No lenger may the body of him sojurne°
On th’orisonte,° as in that latitude.
Night with his mantel, that is derk and rude,°
Gan oversprede the hemisperie° aboute;
For which° departed is this lusty route°
Fro Januarie, with thank° on every side.
Hom to hir houses lustily° they ride,
Wheras° they doon hir thinges as hem leste,°
And whan they sie° hir time goon to reste.

¶Sone after that, this hastif° Januarie
Wol go to bedde, he wol no lenger tarie.
He drinketh ipocras,° clarree,° and vernage°
Of spices hote,° t’encresen his corage;°
And many a letuarie° hadde he ful fin,°
Swiche as the cursed monk dan° Constantin
Hath writen in his book de Coitu;°
To eten hem alle, he nas nothing° eschu.°
And to his privee° freendes thus seide he:
“For Goddes love, as sone as it may be,
Lat voiden° al this hous in curteis wise.”°
And they han doon right as he wol devise.°
Men drinken, and the travers° drawe anon;
The bride was broght abedde as stille as stoon;
And whan the bed was with the preest yblessed,
Out of the chambre hath every wight him dressed.°
And Januarie hath faste° in armes take
His fresshe May, his paradis, his make.°
He lulleth° hir, he kisseth hir ful ofte
With thikke bristles of his berd unsofte,
Lik to° the skin of houndfish, sharp as brere,°
For he was shave al newe in his manere.
He rubbeth hir aboute hir tendre face,
And seide thus, “Allas! I moot° trespace°
To yow, my spouse, and yow gretly offende,
Er time come that I wil doun descende.°
But nathelees, considereth this,” quod he,
“Ther nis no° werkman, whatsoever he be,
That° may both werke wel and hastily;
This wol be doon at leiser parfitly.
It is no fors° how longe that we pleye;
In trewe wedlok wedded be we tweye;
And blessed be the yok that we been inne,
For in our actes we mow do no sinne.
A man may do no sinne with his wif,
Ne hurte himselven with his owene knif;
For we han leve to pleye us° by the lawe.”
Thus laboureth he til that the day gan dawe;°
And than he taketh a sop° in fin clarree,°
And upright in his bed than sitteth he,
And after that he sang ful loude and clere,
And kiste his wif, and made wantoun chere.°
He was al coltish,° ful of ragerie,°
And ful of jargon° as a flekked pie.°
The slakke skin aboute his nekke shaketh,
Whil that he sang; so chaunteth° he and craketh.°

¶But God wot° what that° May thoughte in hir herte,
Whan she him saugh up sittinge in his sherte,
In his night cappe, and with his nekke lene;°
She preiseth nat his pleying worth a bene.°
Than seide he thus, “My reste wol I take;
Now day is come, I may no lenger wake.”
And doun he leide his heed, and sleep° til prime.°
And afterward, whan that he saugh his time,°
Up riseth Januarie; but fresshe May
Holdeth hir° chambre unto the fourthe day,
As usage° is of wives for the beste.
For every labour° somtime moot han reste,°
Or elles longe may he nat endure;
This is to seyn, no lives° creature,
Be it of fish, or brid, or beest, or man.

¶Now wol I speke of woful Damian,
That languissheth for love, as ye shul here;
Therfore I speke to him in this manere:
I seye, “O sely° Damian, allas!
Answer to my demaunde,° as in this cas,°
How shaltow° to thy lady fresshe May
Tell thy wo? She wole alwey seye ‘nay’;
Eek if thou speke, she wol thy wo biwreie;°
God be thin help, I can no bettre seie.”

¶This sike Damian in Venus° fir
So brenneth,° that he dieth for desir;
For which he putte his lif in aventure,°
No lenger mighte he in this wise° endure;
But prively° a penner° gan he borwe,
And in a lettre wroot he al his sorwe,
In manere of a compleint or a lay,°
Unto his faire fresshe° lady May.
And in a purs of silk, heng° on his sherte,
He hath it put, and leide it at his herte.

¶The mone° that, at noon, was, thilke° day
That Januarie hath wedded fresshe May,
In two° of Taur,° was into Cancre° gliden;
So longe hath Maius in hir chambre biden,°
As custume is unto° thise nobles alle.
A bride shal nat eten° in the halle,
Til dayes foure or three dayes atte leste°
Ypassed been; than lat hir go to feste.
The fourthe day compleet° fro noon to noon,
Whan that the heighe masse° was ydoon,
In halle sit this Januarie, and May
As fresh as is the brighte someres° day.
And so bifel how that° this gode man°
Remembred him upon this Damian,
And seide, “Seinte Marie! how may this be,
That Damian entendeth nat° to me?
Is he ay sik,° or how may this bitide?”°
His squieres, which that stoden ther biside,
Excused him bicause of his siknesse,
Which letted him to doon° his bisinesse;°
Noon other cause mighte make him tarie.
“That me forthinketh,”° quod this Januarie,
“He is a gentil squier, by my trouthe!°
If that he deide, it were harm and routhe;°
He is as wis,° discreet, and eek secree°
As any man I woot° of his degree;°
And therto° manly and eek servisable,°
And for to been a thrifty° man right able.
But after mete,° as sone as ever I may,
I wol myself visite him and eek May,
To doon him° al the confort that I can.”
And for that word him blessed every man,°
That, of his bountee° and his gentillesse,°
He wolde so conforten in siknesse
His squier, for it was a gentil° dede.
“Dame,” quod this Januarie, “tak good hede,°
At after° noon ye, with your wommen alle,
Whan ye han been in chambre out of this halle,
That alle ye go see this Damian;
Doth him disport,° he is a gentil man;
And telleth him that I wol him visite,
Have I no thing but° rested me a lite;
And spede° yow faste, for I wole abide°
Til that ye slepe faste by my side.”
And with that word he gan to him to calle
A squier, that was marchal° of his halle,
And tolde him certein thinges, what he wolde.

¶This fresshe May hath streight hir wey yholde,°
With alle hir wommen, unto Damian.
Doun by his beddes side sit she than,
Confortinge him as goodly° as she may.

¶This Damian, whan that his time he say,°
In secree wise° his purs, and eek his bille,°
In which that he ywriten hadde his wille,
Hath put into hir hand, withouten more,°
Save that he siketh° wonder depe° and sore,°
And softely to hir right thus seide he:
“Mercy! And that ye nat discover° me;
For I am deed,° if that this thing be kid.”°
This purs hath she inwith hir bosom hid,
And wente hir wey; ye get namore of° me.

¶But unto Januarie ycomen is she,
That on his beddes side sit° ful softe.
He taketh hir, and kisseth hir ful ofte,
And leide him doun to slepe, and that anon.°
She feined hir° as that she moste gon
Theras° ye woot° that every wight mot nede.°
And whan she of this bille hath taken hede,°
She rente° it al to cloutes° atte laste,
And in the privee° softely it caste.

¶Who studieth° now but faire fresshe May?
Adoun by olde Januarie she lay,
That sleep,° til that the coughe hath him awaked;
Anon he preide hir strepen hir° al naked;
He wolde of hir,° he seide, han som plesaunce,
And seide, hir clothes dide him encombraunce,°
And she obeyeth, be hir lief or looth.°
But lest that precious° folk be with me wrooth,
How that he wroghte,° I dar nat to yow telle;
Or whether hir thoughte it paradis or helle;
But here I lete hem° werken in hir wise°
Til evensong° rong, and that they moste arise.

¶Were it by destinee or aventure,°
Were it by influence° or by nature,
Or constellacion,° that in swich estat°
The hevene stood, that time fortunat°
Was for to putte a bille° of Venus werkes°
(For alle thing hath time,° as seyn thise clerkes)
To any womman, for to gete° hir love,
I can nat seye; but grete God above,
That knoweth that non act is causelees,°
He deme° of al, for I wol hold my pees.
But sooth° is this, how that this fresshe May
Hath take swich impression° that day,
For pitee° of this sike Damian,
That from hir herte she ne drive° can
The remembraunce° for to doon him ese.°
“Certein,” thoght she, “whom that this thing displese,
I rekke° noght, for here I him assure,
To love him best of any creature,
Though he namore hadde than his sherte.”

¶Lo, pitee renneth° sone in gentil° herte.
Heer may ye se how excellent franchise°
In wommen is, whan they hem narwe avise.°
Som tyrant° is, as ther be many oon,
That hath an herte as hard as any stoon,
Which° wolde han lete him sterven° in the place
Wel rather than han graunted him hir grace;°
And hem rejoisen° in hir cruel pride,
And rekke° nat to been an homicide.°
This gentil May, fulfilled of° pitee,
Right of hir hande a lettre made she,
In which she graunteth him hir verray° grace;
Ther lakketh noght but only day and place,
Wher that she mighte unto his lust suffise:°
For it shal be right as° he wol devise.°
And whan she saugh hir time, upon a day,°
To visite this Damian goth May,
And sotilly° this lettre doun she threste°
Under his pilwe,° rede it if him leste.°
She taketh him by the hand, and harde him twiste°
So secrely, that no wight of it wiste,°
And bad him been al hool,° and forth she wente
To Januarie, whan that he for hir sente.

¶Up riseth Damian the nexte morwe,°
Al passed was his siknesse and his sorwe.
He kembeth° him, he proineth him° and piketh,°
He dooth al that his lady lust° and liketh;
And eek to Januarie he gooth as lowe°
As ever dide a dogge for the bowe.°
He is so plesant unto every man,
(For craft° is al, whoso that do it can)
That every wight is fain° to speke him good;
And fully in his lady° grace he stood.

¶Thus lete° I Damian aboute his nede,°
And in my tale forth I wol procede.
Somme clerkes holden that felicitee°
Stant in° delit,° and therefor certein he,
This noble Januarie, with al his might,
In honest° wise,° as longeth° to a knight,
Shoop him° to live ful deliciously.°
His housinge, his array,° as honestly°
To his degree was maked as a kinges.
Amonges othere of his honest° thinges,
He made a gardin, walled al with stoon;
So fair a gardin woot I nowher noon.
For out of doute, I verraily° suppose,
That he that wroot the Romance of the Rose
Ne coude of it the beautee wel devise;°
Ne Priapus ne mighte nat° suffise,
Though he be god of gardins, for to telle
The beautee of the gardin and the welle,
That stood under a laurer° alwey° grene.

¶Ful ofte time he, Pluto, and his quene,
Proserpina, and al hir faiërie°
Disporten hem° and maken melodie
About that welle, and daunced, as men tolde.
This noble knight, this Januarie the olde,
Swich deintee° hath in it to walke and pleie,
That he wol no wight suffren° bere the keye°
Save° he himself; for of the smale wiket°
He bar alwey of silver a smal cliket,°
With which, whan that him leste, he it unshette.°
And whan he wolde paye his wif hir dette
In somer seson, thider wolde he go,
And May his wif, and no wight but° they two;
And thinges which that were nat doon abedde,
He in the gardin parfourned hem and spedde.°
And in this wise,° many a mery day,
Lived this Januarie and fresshe May.
But worldly joye may nat alwey dure°
To Januarie, ne to no creature.

¶O sodein hap,° o thou Fortune instable,°
Lik to the scorpion so deceivable,°
That flaterest with thin heed when thou wolt stinge;
Thy tail is deeth, thurgh thin enveniminge.°
O brotil° joye! o swete venim queinte!°
O monstre, that so subtilly canst peinte°
Thy yiftes, under hewe of stedfastnesse,
That thou deceivest bothe more and lesse!°
Why hastow° Januarie thus deceived,
That haddest him for thy ful frend received?
And now thou hast biraft him° bothe hise eyen,
For sorwe of which desireth he to dyen.
Allas! this noble Januarie free,°
Amidde his lust° and his prosperitee,
Is woxen blind,° and that al sodeinly.
He wepeth and he waileth pitously;
And therwithal° the fir of jalousie,
Lest that his wif shold falle in som folie,°
So brente° his herte, that he wolde fain°
That som man bothe him and hir had slain.
For neither after his deeth, nor in his lif,
Ne wolde he° that she were love° ne wif,
But ever live as widwe° in clothes blake,
Soul° as the turtle° that lost hath hir make.°

¶But atte laste, after a monthe or tweye,
His sorwe gan aswage,° sooth to seye;
For whan he wiste it may noon other be,
He paciently took his adversitee;
Save,° out of doute,° he may nat forgoon°
That he nas jalous° evermore in oon;°
Which jalousie it was so outrageous,°
That neither in halle, n&apos;in° noon other hous,°
Ne in noon other place, neverthemo,
He nolde suffre° hir for to ride or go,°
But if that° he had hand on hir alway;
For which ful ofte wepeth fresshe May,
That loveth Damian so benignely,°
That she mot° outher° dyen sodeinly,
Or elles she mot han him as hir leste;°
She waiteth whan° hir herte wolde breste.°

¶Upon that other side Damian
Bicomen is the sorwefulleste man
That ever was; for neither night ne day
Ne mighte he speke a word to fresshe May,
As to his purpos,° of no swich matere,°
But if that° Januarie moste it here,°
That hadde an hand upon hir evermo.
But nathelees, by writing to and fro
And privee° signes,° wiste° he what she mente;
And she knew eek the fin° of his entente.°

¶O Januarie, what mighte it thee availle,
Thou mightest° see as fer as shippes saille?
For also good° is blind deceived be,
As be deceived whan a man may se.
Lo, Argus, which that° hadde an hondred eyen,
For al that ever he coude poure° or prien,°
Yet was he blent;° and, God wot,° so ben mo,°
That wenen wisly° that it be nat so.
Passe over is an ese,° I sey namore.

¶This fresshe May, that I spak of so yore,°
In warme wex° hath emprented° the cliket,°
That Januarie bar° of the smale wiket,°
By which into his gardin ofte he wente.
And Damian, that knew al hir entente,
The cliket countrefeted° prively;°
Ther nis namore° to seye, but° hastily
Som wonder° by this cliket shal bitide,°
Which ye shul heren, if ye wole abide.°

¶O noble Ovide, ful sooth° seystou,° God woot!
What sleighte° is it, thogh it be long and hoot,°
That he° nil° finde it out in som manere?
By Piramus and Tesbee may men lere;
Thogh they were kept ful long° streite° overal,°
They been accorded,° rouning° thurgh a wal,
Ther° no wight coude han founde out swich a sleighte.°

¶But now to purpos;° er that dayes eighte
Were passed, er the monthe of Juil,° bifil°
That Januarie hath caught so greet a wil,°
Thurgh egging° of his wif, him for to pleye°
In his gardin, and no wight but° they tweye,
That in a morwe° unto this May seith he:
“Ris up, my wif, my love, my lady free;°
The turtles vois is herd, my douve° swete;
The winter is goon, with alle his reines° wete;
Com forth now, with thin eyen columbin!°
How fairer been thy brestes than is win!°
The gardin is enclosed al aboute;
Com forth, my white° spouse; out of doute,°
Thou hast me wounded in min herte, O wif!
No spot° of thee ne knew I al my lif.
Com forth, and lat us taken our disport;°
I chees thee for my wif° and my confort.”

¶Swiche olde lewed° wordes used he;
On° Damian a signe made she,
That he sholde go biforen with his cliket:
This Damian thanne hath opened the wiket,
And in he stirte,° and that in swich manere,
That no wight mighte it see neither yhere;°
And stille° he sit° under a bush anoon.°
This Januarie, as blind as is a stoon,
With Maius in his hand, and no wight mo,°
Into his fresshe gardin is ago,°
And clapte to° the wiket sodeinly.
“Now, wif,” quod he, “heer nis° but thou and I,
That art the creature that I best love.
For, by that lord that sit in heven above,
Lever ich hadde° dyen on a knif,
Than thee offende,° trewe dere wif!
For Goddes sake, thenk how I thee chees,
Noght for no coveitise,° doutelees,
But only for the love I had to thee.
And though that I be old, and may nat see,
Beth to me trewe, and I shal telle yow why.
Three thinges, certes, shul ye winne therby;
First, love of Crist, and to your self honour,
And al min heritage,° toun and tour;
I yeve it yow, maketh chartres° as yow leste;°
This shal be doon tomorwe er sonne reste.°
So wisly° God my soule bringe in blisse,
I prey yow first, in covenant ye me kisse.
And thogh that I be jalous, wite° me noght.
Ye been so depe enprented° in my thoght,
That, whan that I considere your beautee,
And therwithal the unlikly° elde° of me,
I may nat, certes,° thogh I sholde die,
Forbere° to been out of your companie
For verray° love; this is withouten doute.
Now kis me, wif, and lat us rome° aboute.”

¶This fresshe May, whan she thise wordes herde,
Benignely to Januarie answerde,
But first and forward° she bigan to wepe,
“I have,” quod she, “a soule for to kepe
As wel as ye, and also min honour,
And of my wifhod° thilke tendre flour,
Which that I have assured in your hond,
Whan that the preest° to yow my body bond;°
Wherfore I wole answere in this manere
By the leve° of yow, my lord so dere:
I prey to God, that never dawe° the day
That I ne sterve,° as foule° as womman may,°
If ever I do unto my kin that shame,
Or elles I empeire° so my name,
That I be fals; and if I do that lakke,
Do strepe° me and put me in a sakke,
And in the nexte river do me drenche.°
I am a gentil womman and no wenche.°
Why speke ye thus? but men ben ever untrewe,
And wommen have repreve of yow° ay newe.°
Ye han non other contenance,° I leve,
But speke to us of untrust° and repreve.”°

¶And with that word she saugh wher Damian
Sat in the bush, and coughen she bigan,
And with hir finger signes made she,
That Damian shold climbe upon a tree,
That charged° was with fruit, and up he wente;
For verraily° he knew al hir entente,
And every signe that she coude make
Wel bet than Januarie, hir owene make.°
For in a lettre she had told him al
Of this matere, how he werchen shal.°
And thus I lete him sitte upon the pirie,°
And Januarie and May rominge mirie.°

¶Bright was the day, and blew° the firmament,°
Phebus° of gold his stremes° doun hath sent,
To gladen° every flour with his warmnesse.
He was that time in Geminis, as I gesse,
But litel fro his declinacioun°
Of Cancer, Jovis exaltacioun.°
And so bifel that brighte morwe tide,°
That in that gardin, in the ferther° side,
Pluto, that is the king of faiërie,°
And many a lady in his companie,
Folwinge his wif, the queen Proserpina,
Which that he ravisshed out of Ethna

Whil that she gadered floures in the mede,°
In Claudian ye may the story rede,
How in his grisly carte° he hir fette:°—
This king of fairie thanne adoun him sette
Upon a bench of turves,° fresh and grene,
And right anon° thus seide he to his quene.

¶“My wif,” quod he, “ther may no wight sey nay;°
Th’experience so preveth° every day
The treson° whiche that women doon to man.
Ten hondred thousand stories telle I can
Notable° of your untrouthe° and brotilnesse.°
O Salomon, wis, richest of richesse,
Fulfild° of sapience° and of worldly glorie,
Ful worthy° been thy wordes to memorie°
To every wight that wit and reson can.°
Thus preiseth he yet the bountee° of man:
‘Amonges a thousand men yet fond° I oon,
But of wommen alle fond I noon.’
Thus seith the king that knoweth your wikkednesse;
And Jesus filius Syrak, as I gesse,
Ne speketh of yow but selde° reverence.°
A wilde fir° and corrupt pestilence
So falle upon your bodies yet tonight!
Ne see ye nat° this honurable knight,
Bi cause, allas! that he is blind and old,
His owene man° shal make him cokewold;°
Lo, where he sit, the lechour, in the tree!
Now wol I graunten, of my magestee,
Unto this olde blinde worthy knight
That he shal have ayeyn° his eyen sight,°
Whan that his wif wold doon him vileinie;°
Than shal he knowen al hir harlotrie°
Both in repreve° of hir and othere mo.”°

¶“Ye shal,” quod Proserpine, “wol ye so?°
Now, by my modres sires soule I swere,
That I shal yeve° hir suffisant° answere,
And alle wommen after, for hir sake;
That, though they be in any gilt ytake,°
With face bold they shulle hemself° excuse,
And bere hem doun° that wolden hem accuse.
For lakke of answer, noon of hem shal dyen.°
Al° had man seyn a thing with bothe his eyen,
Yit shul we wommen visage it° hardily,
And wepe, and swere, and chide° subtilly,
So that ye men shul been as lewed° as gees.
What rekketh° me of your auctoritees?
I woot° wel that this Jew, this Salomon,
Fond° of us wommen foles many oon.°
But though that he ne fond no° good womman,
Yet hath ther founde many another man°
Wommen ful trewe, ful gode, and vertuous.
Witnesse on hem° that dwelle in Cristes hous,
With martirdom they preved hir constance.°
The Romain gestes° maken remembrance°
Of many a verrai trewe wif also.
But sire, ne be nat wrooth,° albeit so,
Though that he seide he fond no good womman,
I prey yow take the sentence° of the man;
He mente thus, that in soverein° bontee°
Nis noon but° God, that sit° in Trinitee.
Ey! for verray° God, that nis but oon,
What make ye so muche of Salomon?
What though he made a temple, Goddes hous?
What though he were riche and glorious?
So° made he eek a temple of false goddis,
How mighte he do a thing that more forbode° is?
Pardee, as faire as ye his name emplastre,°
He was a lechour and an idolastre;°
And in his elde° he verray God forsook.
And if that God ne hadde,° as seith the book,
Yspared him for his fadres sake, he sholde
Have lost his regne° rather° than he wolde.
I set right noght of° al the vileinie,
That° ye of wommen write, a boterflie.
I am a womman, nedes moot I° speke,
Or elles swelle til min herte breke.
For sithen° he seide that we ben jangleresses,°
As ever hool° I mote brouke° my tresses,°
I shal nat spare,° for no curteisie,
To speke him harm that wolde us vileinie.”°

¶“Dame,” quod this Pluto, “be no lenger wrooth;
I yeve° it up; but sith I swoor min ooth
That I wold graunten him his sighte ageyn,
My word shal stonde, I warne yow, certein.
I am a king, it sit me noght° to lie.”
“And I,” quod she, “a queene of faiërie.
Hir answer shal she have, I undertake;°
Lat us namore wordes heerof° make.
For sothe, I wol no lenger yow contrarie.”°

¶Now lat us turne again to Januarie,
That in the gardin with his faire May
Singeth, ful merier° than the papejay,°
“Yow love I best, and shal, and other noon.”
So longe aboute the aleyes° is he goon,
Til he was come againes° thilke pirie,°
Wheras° this Damian sitteth ful mirie°
An heigh, among the fresshe leves grene.
This fresshe May, that is so bright and shene,°
Gan for to sike,° and seide, “Allas, my side!
Now sir,” quod she, “for aught that may bitide,°
I moste han of° the peres that I see,
Or I mot° die, so sore longeth me°
To eten of the smale peres grene.
Help, for hir love that is of heven quene!
I tel yow wel a womman in my plit°
May han to° fruit so greet an appetit,
That she may dyen, but° she of it have.”
“Allas!” quod he, “That I ne had° heer a knave°
That coude climbe; allas! allas!” quod he,
“That I am blind.” “Ye, sir, no fors,”° quod she:
“But wold ye vouchesauf,° for Goddes sake,
The pirie inwith° your armes for to take,
(For wel I woot that ye mistruste me)
Than sholde I climbe wel ynogh,” quod she,
“So° I my foot might sette upon your bak.”
“Certes,” quod he, “theron shal be no lak,
Mighte I yow helpen with min herte blood.”

¶He stoupeth° doun, and on his bak she stood,
And caughte hir by a twiste,° and up she gooth.
Ladies, I prey yow that ye be nat wrooth;
I can nat glose,° I am a rude° man.
And sodeinly anon° this Damian
Gan pullen up the smok,° and in he throng.°

¶And whan that Pluto saugh this grete wrong,
To Januarie he gaf again his sighte,
And made him see, as wel as evere he mighte.
And whan that he had caught° his sighte again,
Ne was ther never man of thing so fain.°
But on his wif his thoght was evermo;
Up to the tree he caste his eyen two,
And saugh that Damian his wif had dressed°
In swich manere, it may nat ben expressed
But if° I wolde speke uncurteisly:°
And up he yaf° a roring and a cry
As doth the moder whan the child shal die:
“Out! help! allas! harrow!” he gan to crie,
“O stronge° lady store,° what dostow?”°
And she answerde, “Sir, what eileth yow?°
Have pacience, and reson in your minde,
I have yow holpe° on both your eyen blinde.
Up° peril of my soule, I shal nat lien,
As me was° taught, to hele° with your eyen,
Was nothing° bet° to make yow to see
Than strugle with a man upon a tree.
God woot, I dide it in ful good entente.”
“Strugle!” quod he, “Ye, algate° in it wente!
God yeve° yow bothe on shames deeth° to dyen!
He swived° thee, I saugh it with mine eyen,
And elles° be I hanged by the hals!”°
“Thanne is,” quod she, “my medicine al fals;
For certeinly, if that ye mighte see,
Ye wolde nat seyn thise wordes unto me;
Ye han som glimsing° and no parfit sighte.
“I see,” quod he, “as wel as ever I mighte,
Thonked be God! with both mine eyen two,
And by my trouth,° me thoughte° he dide thee so.”
“Ye maze,° maze, gode sire,” quod she,
“This thank have I for I have maad yow see;
Allas!” quod she, “That ever I was so kinde!”

¶“Now, dame,” quod he, “lat al passe out of minde.
Com doun, my lief,° and if I have missaid,
God help me so, as I am ivel apaid.°
But, by my fader soule, I wende han° seyn,
How that this Damian had by thee leyn,
And that thy smok had lein upon his brest.”
“Ye, sire,” quod she, “ye may wene° as yow lest;°
But, sire, a man that waketh out of his sleep,
He may nat sodeinly wel taken keep°
Upon° a thing, ne seen° it parfitly,
Til that he be adawed° verraily;°
Right so a man, that longe hath blind ybe,°
Ne may nat° sodeinly so wel ysee,°
First whan his sighte is newe come agein,
As he that hath a day or two yseyn.
Til that your sighte ysatled° be a while,
Ther may ful many a sighte yow bigile.°
Beth war, I prey yow; for, by heven° king,
Ful many a man weneth to seen° a thing,
And it is al another° than it semeth.
He that misconceiveth,° he misdemeth.”°
And with that word she leep° doun fro the tree.

¶This Januarie, who is glad but° he?
He kisseth hir, and clippeth° hir ful ofte,
And on hir wombe° he stroketh hir ful softe,
And to his palais hoom he hath hir lad.
Now, gode men, I pray yow to be glad.
Thus endeth heer my tale of Januarie;
God bless us and his moder Seinte Marie!
