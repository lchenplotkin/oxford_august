Ther was in Asie, in a greet citee,
Amonges Cristen folk, a Jewerie,°
Sustened by a lord of that contree
For foule usure° and lucre of vilanie,°
Hateful to Crist and to his compaignie;
And thurgh the strete men might ride or wende,°
For it was free, and open at either ende.

A litel scole of Cristen folk ther stood
Doun at the ferther ende, in which ther were
Children an heep,° ycome of Cristen blood,
That lerned in that scole yeer by yere
Swich maner doctrine as men used there,
This is to seyn, to singen and to rede,
As smale children doon in hir childhede.

Among thes children was a widwes° sone,
A litel clergeon,° seven yeer of age,
That day by day to scole° was his wone,°
And eek also, wheras he saugh th’image
Of Cristes moder, hadde he in usage,
As him was taught, to knele adoun and seye
His Ave Marie,° as he goth by the weye.

Thus hath this widwe hir litel sone ytaught
Our blisful lady, Cristes moder dere,
To worshipe ay, and he forgate it naught,
For sely° child wol alwey sone° lere;°
But ay, whan I remembre on this matere,
Seint Nicholas stant ever in my presence,°
For he so yong to Crist did reverence.

This litel child, his litel book lerninge,
As he sat in the scole at his primer,
He Alma redemptoris° herde singe,
As children lerned hire antiphoner;°
And, as he dorste,° he drough° him ner and ner,
And herkned° ay the wordes and the note,
Til he the firste vers coude al by rote.

Noght wiste° he what this Latin was to seye,
For he so yong and tendre was of age;
But on a day his felaw gan he preye
T’expounden° him this song in his langage,
Or telle him why this song was in usage;°
This preide he him to construe and declare
Ful often time upon his knowes° bare.

His felaw, which that elder was than he,
Answerde him thus: “This song, I have herd seye,
Was maked of° our blisful lady free,
Hir to salue,° and eek hir for to preye
To been our help and socour° whan we deye.
I can no more expounde in this matere;
I lerne song, I can° but smal grammere.”

“And is this song maked in reverence
Of Cristes moder?” seid this innocent;
“Now certes, I wol do my diligence
To conne it al,° er Cristemasse is went;°
Though that° I for my primer° shal be shent,°
And shal be beten thryes in an houre,
I wol it conne, our lady for t’honoure.”

His felaw taughte him homward° prively,°
Fro day to day, til he coude° it by rote,
And thanne he song it wel and boldely
Fro word to word, acording with the note;
Twies a day it passed thurgh his throte,
To scoleward and homward whan he wente;
On Cristes moder set was his entente.

As I have seid, thurghout the Jewerie
This litel child, as he cam to and fro,
Ful murily than wolde he singe, and crye
O Alma redemptoris evermo.°
The swetnesse hath his herte perced° so
Of Cristes moder, that, to hir to preye,
He can nat stinte of° singing by the weye.

Our firste fo, the serpent Sathanas,
That hath in Jewes herte his waspes nest,
Up swal,° and seid, “O Hebraik peple, allas!
Is this to yow a thing that is honest,°
That swich a boy shal walken as him lest°
In your despit,° and singe of swich sentence,°
Which is agains your lawes reverence?”°

Fro thennes forth the Jewes han conspired
This innocent out of this world to chace;°
An homicide° therto han they hired,
That in an aley° hadde a privee place;
And as the child gan forby for to pace,
This cursed Jew him hente° and heeld him faste,
And kitte° his throte, and in a pit him caste.

I sey that in a wardrobe° they him threwe
Where as these Jewes purgen hir entraille.°
O cursed folk of Herodes al newe,
What may youre ivel entente yow availle?
Mordre wol out, certein, it wol nat faille,
And namly° ther th’onour of God shal sprede,
The blood out cryeth on your cursed dede.

O martir, souded° to virginitee,
Now maystow singen, folwinge ever in oon
The white lamb celestial—quod she—
Of which the grete evangelist, Seint John,
In Pathmos wroot,° which seith that they that goon
Biforn this lamb, and singe a song al newe,
That never, fleshly,° wommen they ne knewe.”

This poure widwe° awaiteth° al that night
After° hir litel child, but he cam noght;
For which, as sone as it was dayes light,
With face pale of drede and bisy thoght,°
She hath at scole and elleswhere him soght,
Til finally she gan so fer espie°
That he last seyn° was in the Jewerie.

With modres pitee in hir brest enclosed,
She gooth, as she were half out of hir minde,
To every place wher she hath supposed
By liklihede hir litel child to finde;
And ever on Cristes moder meke and kinde
She cride, and atte laste thus she wroghte,°
Among the cursed Jewes she him soghte.

She fraineth° and she preyeth pitously
To every Jew that dwelte in thilke° place,
To telle hire, if hir child wente oght forby.°
They seide, “Nay”; but Jhesu, of his grace,
Yaf° in hir thought, inwith a litel space,
That in that place after° hir son she cride,
Where he was casten in a pit biside.

O grete God, that parfournest° thy laude°
By mouth of innocentz, lo heer thy might!
This gemme of chastitee, this emeraude,°
And eek of martirdom the ruby bright,
Ther he with throte ycorven° lay upright,
He “Alma redemptoris” gan to singe
So loud, that al the place gan to ringe.

The Cristen folk, that thurgh the strete wente,
In comen, for to wondre upon this thing,
And hastily they for the provost° sente;
He cam anon withouten tarying,°
And herieth° Crist that is of heven king,
And eek his moder, honour of mankinde,
And after that, the Jewes leet he binde,°

This child with pitous lamentacioun
Uptaken was, singinge his song alway;
And with honour of greet processioun
They carien him unto the nexte° abbay.
His moder swowning° by the bere° lay;
Unnethe° might the peple that was there
This newe Rachel bringe fro his bere.

With torment and with shamful deth echon
This provost dooth thes Jewes for to sterve°
That of this mordre wiste,° and that anon;°
He nolde° no swich cursednesse observe.°
Ivel shal have, that ivel wol deserve.
Therfor with wilde hors he dide hem drawe,°
And after that he heng hem by° the lawe.

Upon his bere ay lith this innocent
Biforn the chief auter,° whil the mass laste,
And after that, th’abbot with his covent
Han sped hem° for to burie him ful faste;
And whan they holy water on him caste,
Yet spak this child, whan spreind° was holy water,
And song—“O Alma redemptoris mater!”

This abbot, which that was an holy man
As monkes been, or elles oghten be,
This yonge child to conjure° he bigan,
And seid, “O dere child, I halse° thee,
In vertu° of the holy Trinitee,
Tel me what is thy cause for to singe,
Sith that thy throte is cut, to my seminge?”°

“My throte is cut unto my nekke-boon,”
Seid this child, “and, as by wey of kinde,°
I sholde han deyed, ye, long time agoon,
But Jesu Crist, as ye in bookes finde,
Wol that his glorie laste and be in minde,
And, for the worship of his moder dere,
Yet may I singe ‘O Alma’ loude and clere.

This welle° of mercy, Cristes moder° swete,
I loved alwey, as after my conninge;°
And whan that I my life shold forlete,°
To me she cam, and bad° me for to singe
This anthem° verraily in my deyinge,
As ye han herd, and, whan that I had songe,
Me thought,° she leide a grein° upon my tonge.

Wherfore I singe, and singe I moot° certein
In honour of that blisful maiden free,
Til fro my tonge oftaken is the grein;
And after that thus seide she to me,
‘My litel child, now wol I fecche thee
Whan that the grein is fro thy tonge ytake;
Be nat agast,° I wol thee nat forsake.’ ”°

This holy monk, this abbot, him mene I,
His tonge out-caughte, and took awey the grein,
And he yaf up the goost° ful softely.
And whan this abbot had this wonder seyn,
His salte teres trikled doun as rein,°
And gruf° he fil al plat° upon the grounde,
And stille he lay as he had ben ybounde.°

The covent eek lay on the pavement
Wepinge, and herien° Cristes moder dere,
And after that they rise, and forth ben went,
And toke awey this martir from his bere,°
And in a toumbe of marbul-stones clere
Enclosen they his litel body swete;
Ther he is now, God leve us for to meete.°

O yonge Hugh of Lincoln, slain also
With cursed Jewes, as it is notable,
For it nis° but a litel while ago;
Preye eek for us, we sinful folk unstable,
That, of his mercy, God so merciable
On us his grete mercy multiplie,
For reverence of his moder Marie.
