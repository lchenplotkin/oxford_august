¶Ther was, as telleth Titus Livius,°
A knight that called was Virginius,
Fulfild of° honour and of worthinesse,
And strong of freendes° and of greet richesse.

¶This knight a doghter hadde by his wif,
No children hadde he mo in al his lif.
Fair was this maide in excellent beautee
Aboven every wight° that man may see;
For nature hath with soverein° diligence
Yformed° hir in so greet excellence,
As though she wolde seyn, “Lo!° I, Nature,
Thus can I forme and peinte a creature,
Whan that me list;° who can me countrefete?°
Pigmalion noght, though he ay forge° and bete,°
Or grave,° or peinte; for I dar wel seyn,
Apelles, Zanzis, sholde werche in vein,
Outher° to grave or peinte or forge or bete,
If they presumed me to countrefete.
For he that is the former principal°
Hath maked° me his vicaire general,°
To forme and peinten erthely creaturis
Right as me list,° and ech thing in my cure° is
Under the mone, that may wane° and waxe,°
And for my werk right no thing° wol I axe;°
My lord and I ben ful of oon accord;°
I made hir to the worship° of my lord.
So° do I al mine other creatures,
What colour that they han, or what figures.”—
Thus semeth me° that Nature wolde seye.
This maide of age twelf yeer was and tweie,°
In which that Nature hadde swich delit.°
For right as she can peinte a lilie whit
And reed° a rose, right with swich peinture°
She peinted hath this noble creature
Er she were born, upon hir limes free,°
Wheras° by right swich colours sholde be;
And Phebus° diyd hath hir tresses grete°
Lik to the stremes° of his burned° hete.
And if that° excellent was hir beautee,
A thousand-fold more vertuous was she.
In hir ne lakked° no condicioun,
That is to preise, as by discrecioun.°
As wel in goost° as body chast° was she;
For which she floured in virginitee
With alle humilitee and abstinence,
With alle attemperaunce° and pacience,
With mesure° eek of bering and array.
Discreet she was in answering alway;
Though° she were wis as Pallas, dar I seyn,
Hir facound° eek ful wommanly and plein,
No countrefeted° termes hadde she
To seme wis; but after° hir degree°
She spak, and alle hir wordes more and lesse
Souninge in° vertu and in gentillesse.
Shamfast° she was in maidens shamfastnesse,
Constant in herte, and ever in bisinesse°
To drive hir out of idel slogardie.°
Bacus hadde of hir mouth right no maistrie;°
For win and youthe doon° Venus° encrece,
As men in fir wol casten° oile or grece.
And of hir owene vertu, unconstreined,
She hath ful ofte time sik hir feined,°
For that° she wolde fleen° the companie
Wher likly was to treten° of folie,
As is at festes, revels, and at daunces,
That been occasions of° daliaunces.°
Swich thinges maken children for to be
To sone ripe° and bold, as men may see,
Which is ful perilous, and hath ben yore.°
For al to sone may she lerne lore°
Of boldnesse, whan she woxe is° a wif.

¶And ye maistresses° in your olde lif,°
That lordes doghtres han in governaunce,
Ne taketh of° my wordes no displesaunce;°
Thenketh that ye ben set in governinges°
Of lordes doghtres, only for two thinges:
Outher° for ye han kept your honestee,°
Or elles ye han falle in freletee,°
And knowen wel ynough the olde daunce,°
And han forsaken fully swich meschaunce°
For evermo; therfore, for Cristes sake,
To teche hem vertu loke that ye ne slake.°
A theef of venisoun,° that hath forlaft°
His likerousnesse,° and al his olde craft,
Can kepe° a forest best of any man.
Now kepeth hem° wel, for if ye wol,° ye can;
Loke wel that ye unto no vice assente,
Lest ye be dampned for your wikke entente;
For whoso doth, a traitour is certein.
And taketh kepe of that° that I shal seyn;
Of alle tresons soverein° pestilence°
Is whan a wight bitraiseth° innocence.
Ye fadres and ye modres eek also,
Though ye han children, be it oon or mo,
Your° is the charge° of al hir surveiaunce,
Whil that they been under your governaunce.°
Beth war° if by ensample of your livinge,
Or by your necligence in chastisinge,
That they ne perisse;° for I dar wel seye,
If that they doon, ye shul it dere abeie.°
Under a shepherd softe and necligent
The wolf hath many a sheep and lamb torent.°
Suffiseth oon ensample° now as here,
For I mot turne again to my matere.°

¶This maide, of which I wol this tale expresse,°
So kepte° hirself, hir neded no maistresse;
For in hir living° maidens mighten rede,
As in a book, every good word or dede,
That longeth° to a maiden vertuous;
She was so prudent and so bounteuous.°
For which the fame out sprong° on every side
Bothe of hir beautee and hir bountee° wide;
That thurgh that land they preised hir echone,°
That loved vertu, save envie allone,
That sory is of° other mennes wele,°
And glad is of his sorwe and his unhele;°
(The doctour maketh this descripcioun).
This maide upon a day° wente in the toun
Toward a temple, with hir moder dere,
As is of yonge maidens the manere.
Now was ther thanne a justice in that toun,
That governour was of that regioun.
And so bifel,° this juge his eyen caste
Upon this maide, avisinge him° ful faste,°
As she cam forby ther° this juge stood.
Anon° his herte chaunged and his mood,
So was he caught with beautee of this maide;
And to himself ful prively° he saide,
“This maide shal be min, for° any man.”
Anon the feend° into his herte ran,
And taughte him sodeinly, that he by slighte°
The maiden to his purpos° winne mighte.
For certes, by no force, ne by no mede,
Him thoughte, he was nat able for to spede;°
For she was strong of° freendes, and eek she
Confermed° was in swich soverain bountee,°
That wel he wiste° he mighte hir never winne
As for to° make hir with hir body sinne.

¶For which, by greet deliberacioun,
He sente after a cherl,° was in the toun,
Which that he knew for° subtil° and for bold.
This juge unto this cherl his tale hath told
In secree wise,° and made him to ensure,°
He sholde telle it to no creature,
And if he dide, he sholde lese° his heed.
Whan that assented° was this cursed reed,°
Glad was this juge and maked him greet chere,°
And yaf° him yiftes preciouse and dere.
Whan shapen° was al hir conspiracie
Fro point to point,° how that his lecherie
Parfourned sholde been ful subtilly,°
As ye shul here it after openly,
Hoom gooth the cherl, that highte° Claudius.
This false juge that highte Apius,
So was his name (for this is no fable,°
But knowen for historial thing° notable,
The sentence° of it sooth is, out of doute),

¶This false juge gooth now faste° aboute°
To hasten his delit al that he may.
And so bifel sone after, on a day,
This false juge, as telleth us the storie,
As he was wont,° sat in his consistorie,°
And gaf his domes° upon sondry cas.°
This false cherl cam forth a ful greet pas,°
And seide, “Lord, if that it be your wille,
As dooth me right° upon this pitous bille,°
In which I pleine upon° Virginius.
And if that he wol seyn it is nat thus,
I wol it preve, and finde good witnesse,
That sooth° is that° my bille wol expresse.”
The juge answerde, “Of this, in his absence,
I may nat yeve diffinitif sentence.
Lat do him calle,° and I wol gladly here;
Thou shalt have alle right, and no wrong here.”

¶Virginius cam, to wite° the juges wille,
And right anon was rad° this cursed bille;
The sentence° of it was as ye shul here.
“To yow, my lord, sire Apius so dere,°
Sheweth° your povre servant Claudius,
How that° a knight, called Virginius,
Agains the lawe, again al equitee,
Holdeth, expres° again the wil of me,
My servant, which that° is my thral° by right,
Which fro min hous was stole° upon a night,
Whil that she was ful yong; this wol I preve
By witness, lord, so that° it nat yow greve.°
She nis his doghter nat,° what so he seye;
Wherfore to yow, my lord the juge, I preye,
Yeld me° my thral, if that it be your wille.”
Lo! this was al the sentence of his bille.

¶Virginius gan upon the cherl biholde,°
But hastily, er he his tale tolde,
And wolde have preved it, as sholde a knight,
And eek by witnessing of many a wight,°
That it was fals that seide his adversarie,
This cursed juge wolde no thing tarie,°
Ne here° a word more of Virginius,
But yaf° his jugement, and seide thus:—
“I deme° anon this cherl his servant have;°
Thou shalt no lenger in thin hous hir save.°
Go bring hir forth, and put hire in our warde,°
The cherl shal have his thral, this I awarde.”°

¶And whan this worthy knight Virginius,
Thurgh sentence of this justice Apius,
Most by force his dere doghter yiven°
Unto the juge, in lecherie to liven,
He gooth him° hoom, and sette him° in his halle,
And leet anon his dere doghter calle,°
And, with a face deed° as asshen° colde,
Upon hir humble face he gan biholde,°
With fadres pitee stiking thurgh° his herte,
Al wolde he from his purpos nat° converte.

¶“Doghter,” quod he, “Virginia, by thy name,
Ther been two weyes, outher° deeth or shame,
That thou most suffre; allas! that I was bore!
For never thou deservedest wherfore°
To dyen with a swerd or with a knif.
O dere doghter, ender of my lif,
Which° I have fostred up° with swich plesaunce,
That thou were never out of my remembraunce!°
O doghter, which that° art my laste wo,
And in my lif my laste joye also,
O gemme of chastitee, in pacience
Take° thou thy deeth, for this is my sentence.°
For love and nat for hate, thou most be deed;
My pitous hand mot° smiten of thin heed.
Allas! that ever Apius thee say!°
Thus hath he falsly juged thee today”—
And tolde hir al the cas,° as ye bifore
Han herd; nat nedeth° for to telle it more.

¶“O mercy, dere fader,” quod this maide,
And with that word she both hir armes laide
About his nekke, as she was wont to do:
The teres broste° out of hir eyen two,
And seide, “Gode fader, shal I die?
Is ther no grace?° Is ther no remedie?”
“No, certes, dere doghter min,” quod he.
“Thanne yif me leiser,° fader min,” quod she,
“My deeth for to compleine° a litel space;°
For pardee,° Jepte yaf his doghter grace
For to compleine, er° he hir slow,° allas!
And God it woot,° no thing was hir trespas,°
But for° she ran hir fader first to see,
To welcome him with greet solempnitee.”°

¶And with that word she fil aswowne° anon,
And after, whan hir swowning is agon,°
She riseth up, and to hir fader saide,
“Blessed be God, that I shal die a maide.
Yif° me my deeth, er that I have a shame;
Doth with your child your wil, a° Goddes name!”
And with that word she preyed° him ful ofte,
That with his swerd he wolde smite softe,°
And with that word aswowne doun she fil.

¶Hir fader, with ful sorweful herte and wil,
Hir heed of smoot,° and by the top° it hente,°
And to the juge he gan it to presente,°
As he sat yet in doom° in consistorie.°

¶And whan the juge it saugh, as seith the storie,
He bad° to take him and anhange° him faste.
But right anon° a thousand peple in thraste,
To save the knight, for routhe° and for pitee,
For knowen was the false iniquitee.
The peple anon° hath suspect° of this thing,
By manere of the cherles chalanging,°
That it was by the assent° of Apius;
They wisten° wel that he was lecherous.
For which unto this Apius they gon,
And caste him in a prison right anon,
Theras° he slow himself; and Claudius,
That servant was unto this Apius,
Was demed° for to hange upon a tree;
But° that Virginius, of his pitee,°
So preide for him° that he was exiled;
And elles,° certes, he had been bigiled.°
The remenant were anhanged,° more and lesse,°
That were consentant of° this cursednesse.—

¶Heer men may seen how sinne hath his merite!°
Beth war, for no man woot whom God wol smite°
In no degree,° ne in which maner wise°
The worm° of conscience may agrise°
Of° wikked lif, though it so privee° be,
That no man woot therof° but° God and he.
For be he lewed° man, or elles lered,°
He noot° how soon that he shal been afered.°
Therfore I rede° yow this conseil take,
Forsaketh° sinne, er sinne yow forsake.
