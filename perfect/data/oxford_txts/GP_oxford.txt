Whan that Aprille with his shoures sote
The droghte of March hath perced to the roote,
And bathed every veine in swich licour,
Of which vertu engendred is the flour;
Whan Zephirus eek with his swete breeth
Inspired hath in every holt and heeth
The tendre croppes, and the yonge sonne
Hath in the Ram his halfe cours yronne,
And smale fowles maken melodie,
That slepen al the night with open yÃ«,
(So priketh hem nature in hir corages ):
Than longen folk to goon on pilgrimages
(And palmers for to seken straunge strondes )
To ferne halwes, couthe in sondry londes;
And specially, from every shires ende
Of Engelond, to Caunterbury they wende,
The holy blisful martir for to seke,
That hem hath holpen, whan that they were seke.
Bifel that, in that seson on a day,
In Southwerk at the Tabard as I lay
Redy to wenden on my pilgrimage
To Caunterbury with ful devout corage,
At night was come into that hostelrie
Wel nine and twenty in a compaignie,
Of sondry folk, by aventure yfalle
In felawshipe, and pilgrims were they alle,
That toward Caunterbury wolden ride;
The chambres and the stables weren wide,
And wel we weren esed at the beste.
And shortly, whan the sonne was to reste,
So hadde I spoken with hem everichon,
That I was of hir felawshipe anon,
And made forward erly for to rise,
To take our wey, ther as I yow devise.
But natheles, whil I have time and space,
Er that I ferther in this tale pace,
Me thinketh it acordaunt to resoun,
To telle yow al the condicioun
Of ech of hem, so as it semed me,
And which they weren, and of what degree;
And eek in what array that they were inne:
And at a knight than wol I first biginne.
A Knight ther was, and that a worthy man,
That fro the time that he first bigan
To riden out, he loved chivalrie,
Trouthe and honour, fredom and curteisie.
Ful worthy was he in his lordes werre,
And therto hadde he riden (no man ferre )
As wel in Cristendom as hethenesse,
And ever honoured for his worthinesse.
At Alisaundre he was, whan it was wonne;
Ful ofte time he had the bord bigonne
Aboven alle naciouns in Pruce.
In Lettow hadde he reised and in Ruce,
No Cristen man so ofte of his degree.
In Gernade at the sege eek hadde he be
Of Algezir, and riden in Belmarie.
At Lieys was he, and at Satalie,
Whan they were wonne; and in the Grete See
At many a noble arive hadde he be.
At mortal batailles hadde he been fiftene,
And foughten for our feith at Tramissene
In listes thries, and ay had slain his foo.
This ilke worthy knight had been also
Somtime with the lord of Palatie,
Agein another hethen in Turkie:
And evermore he hadde a soverein pris.
And though that he were worthy, he was wis,
And of his port as meke as is a maide.
He never yet no vileinie ne saide
In al his lif, unto no maner wight.
He was a verray parfit gentil knight.
But for to tellen yow of his array,
His hors were goode, but he was nat gay.
Of fustian he wered a gipoun
And al bismotered with his habergeoun;
For he was late ycome from his viage,
And wente for to doon his pilgrimage.
With him ther was his sone, a yong Squyer
A lovere, and a lusty bacheler,
With lokkes crulle, as they were leid in presse.
Of twenty yeer of age he was, I gesse.
Of his stature he was of even lengthe,
And wonderly delivere, and greet of strengthe.
And he had been somtime in chivachie,
In Flaundres, in Artois, and Picardie,
And born him wel, as in so litel space,
In hope to stonden in his lady grace.
Embrouded was he, as it were a mede
Al ful of fresshe floures, white and rede.
Singinge he was, or floitinge, al the day;
He was as fresh as is the monthe of May.
Short was his gown, with sleves longe and wide.
Wel coude he sitte on hors, and faire ride.
He coude songes make and wel endite,
Juste and daunce, and wel purtreye and write,
So hote he loved, that by nightertale
He sleep namore than doth a nightingale.
Curteis he was, lowly, and servisable,
And carf biforn his fader at the table.
A Yeman hadde he, and servaunts namo
At that time, for him liste ride so;
And he was clad in cote and hood of grene;
A sheef of pecok-arwes bright and kene
Under his belt he bar ful thriftily;
(Wel coude he dresse his takel yemanly:
His arwes drouped noght with fetheres lowe ),
And in his hand he bar a mighty bowe.
A not-heed hadde he, with a broun visage.
Of woodcraft wel coude he al the usage.
Upon his arm he bar a gay bracer,
And by his side a swerd and bokeler,
And on that other side a gay daggere,
Harneised wel, and sharpe as point of spere;
A Cristofre on his brest of silver shene.
An horn he bar, the bawdrik was of grene;
A forster was he, soothly, as I gesse.
Ther was also a nonne, a Prioresse,
That of hir smiling was ful simple and coy;
Hir gretteste ooth was but by Seinte Loy;
And she was cleped madame Eglentine.
Ful wel she songe the service divine,
Entuned in hir nose ful semely;
And Frensh she spak ful faire and fetisly,
After the scole of Stratford atte Bowe,
For Frensh of Paris was to hire unknowe.
At mete wel ytaught was she withalle;
She leet no morsel from hir lippes falle,
Ne wette hir fingres in hir sauce depe.
Wel coud she carie a morsel, and wel kepe,
That no drope ne fille upon hir brest.
In curteisie was set ful muche hir lest.
Hir over lippe wiped she so clene,
That in hir coppe was no ferthing sene
Of grece, whan she dronken hadde hir draughte.
Ful semely after hir mete she raughte,
And sikerly she was of greet disport,
And ful plesaunt, and amiable of port,
And peined hir to countrefete chere
Of court, and ben estatlich of manere,
And to ben holden digne of reverence.
But, for to speken of hir conscience,
She was so charitable and so pitous,
She wolde wepe, if that she sawe a mous
Caught in a trappe, if it were ded or bledde.
Of smale houndes had she, that she fedde
With rosted flesh, or milk and wastelbreed.
But sore weep she if oon of hem were deed,
Or if men smoot it with a yerde smerte:
And al was conscience and tendre herte.
Ful semely hir wimpel pinched was;
Hir nose tretis; hir eyen greye as glas;
Hir mouth ful smal, and therto softe and reed;
But sikerly she hadde a fair forheed;
It was almost a spanne brood, I trowe;
For, hardily, she was nat undergrowe.
Ful fetis was hir cloke, as I was war.
Of smal coral aboute hire arm she bar
A peire of bedes, gauded al with grene;
And theron heng a broche of gold ful shene,
On which ther was first write a crowned A,
And after, Amor vincit omnia.
Another Nonne with hire hadde she,
That was hir chapeleine, and preestes three.
A Monk ther was, a fair for the maistrie,
An outrider, that loved venerie;
A manly man, to ben an abbot able.
Ful many a deintee hors hadde he in stable:
And, whan he rood, men mighte his bridel here
Ginglen in a whistling wind as clere,
And eek as loude as dooth the chapel belle,
Ther as this lord was kepere of the celle.
The rule of Seint Maure or of Seint Beneit,
Bicause that it was old and somdel streit,
This ilke monk leet olde thinges pace,
And held after the newe world the space.
He yaf nat of that text a pulled hen,
That seith, that hunters been nat holy men;
Ne that a monk, whan he is recchelees,
Is likned til a fish that is waterlees;
This is to seyn, a monk out of his cloistre.
But thilke text held he nat worth an oystre;
And I seyde, his opinioun was good.
What sholde he studie, and make himselven wood,
Upon a book in cloistre alwey to poure,
Or swinken with his handes, and laboure,
As Austin bit? How shal the world be served?
Lat Austin have his swink to him reserved.
Therfore he was a pricasour aright;
Grehoundes he hadde, as swift as fowl in flight;
Of priking and of hunting for the hare
Was al his lust, for no cost wolde he spare.
I seigh his sleves purfiled at the hond
With gris, and that the fineste of a lond;
And, for to festne his hood under his chin,
He hadde of gold ywroght a curious pin:
A luf-knotte in the gretter end ther was.
His heed was bald, that shoon as any glas,
And eek his face, as he had been anoint.
He was a lord ful fat and in good point;
Hise eyen stepe, and rollinge in his heed,
That stemed as a forneis of a leed;
His bootes souple, his hors in greet estat.
Now certeinly he was a fair prelat;
He was nat pale as a forpined goost.
A fat swan loved he best of any roost.
His palfrey was as broun as is a berie.
A Frere ther was, a wantowne and a merie,
A limitour, a ful solempne man.
In all the ordres foure is noon that can
So muche of daliaunce and fair langage.
He hadde maad ful many a mariage
Of yonge wommen, at his owne cost.
Unto his ordre he was a noble post.
Ful wel biloved and famulier was he
With frankleins overal in his contree,
And eek with worthy wommen of the toun:
For he had power of confessioun,
As seide himself, wel more than a curat,
For of his ordre he was licenciat.
Ful swetely herde he confessioun,
And plesaunt was his absolucioun;
He was an esy man to yeve penaunce
Ther as he wist to han a good pitaunce;
For unto a poure ordre for to yive
Is signe that a man is wel yshrive.
For if he yaf, he dorste make avaunt,
He wiste that a man was repentaunt.
For many a man so harde is of his herte,
He may nat wepe althogh him sore smerte.
Therfore, in stede of wepinge and preyeres,
Men moot yeve silver to the povre freres.
His tipet was ay farsed ful of knives
And pinnes, for to yeven faire wives.
And certeinly he hadde a murie note;
Wel coude he singe and pleyen on a rote.
Of yeddinges he bar outrely the pris.
His nekke whit was as the flour-de-lis;
Therto he strong was as a champioun.
He knew the tavernes wel in every toun,
And every hostiler and tappestere
Bet than a lazar or a beggestere;
For unto swich a worthy man as he
Acorded nat, as by his facultee,
To han with sike lazars aqueintaunce.
It is nat honeste, it may nat avaunce
For to delen with no swich poraille,
But al with riche and sellers of vitaille.
And overal, ther as profit sholde arise,
Curteis he was, and lowly of servise.
Ther was no man nowher so vertuous.
He was the beste beggere in his hous;
And yaf a certeyn ferme for the graunt;
Noon of his bretheren cam ther in his haunt;
For thogh a widwe hadde noght a sho,
So plesaunt was his âIn principio,â
Yet wolde he have a ferthing, er he wente.
His purchas was wel bettre than his rente.
And rage he coude, as it were right a whelpe.
In love-dayes ther coude he muchel helpe.
For there he was nat lik a cloisterer,
With thredbar cope, as is a poure scoler,
But he was lik a maister or a pope.
Of double worsted was his semicope,
That rounded as a belle out of the presse.
Somwhat he lipsed, for his wantownesse,
To make his English swete upon his tonge;
And in his harping, whan that he had songe,
His eyen twinkled in his heed aright,
As doon the sterres in the frosty night.
This worthy limitour was cleped Huberd.
A Marchant was ther with a forked berd,
In mottelee, and hye on horse he sat,
Upon his heed a Flaundrish bever hat;
His bootes clasped faire and fetisly.
His resons spak he ful solempnely,
Souninge alway thâencrees of his winning.
He wold the see were kept for any thing
Bitwixen Middelburgh and Orewelle.
Wel coude he in eschaunge sheeldes selle.
This worthy man ful wel his wit bisette;
Ther wiste no wight that he was in dette,
So estatly was he of his governaunce,
With his bargaines, and with his chevisaunce.
For sothe he was a worthy man withalle,
But sooth to seyn, I noot how men him calle.
A Clerk ther was of Oxenford also,
That unto logik hadde longe ygo.
As lene was his hors as is a rake,
And he nas nat right fat, I undertake;
But looked holwe, and therto soberly.
Ful thredbar was his overest courtepy;
For he had geten him yet no benefice,
Ne was so worldly for to have office.
For him was levere have at his beddes heed
Twenty bokes, clad in blak or reed,
Of Aristotle and his philosophie,
Than robes riche, fithele, or gay sautrie.
But al be that he was a philosophre,
Yet hadde he but litel gold in cofre;
But al that he mighte of his freendes hente,
On bookes and on lerninge he it spente,
And bisily gan for the soules preye
Of hem that yaf him wherwith to scoleye.
Of studie took he most cure and most hede.
Noght o word spak he more than was nede,
And that was seid in forme and reverence,
And short and quik, and ful of hy sentence.
Sowninge in moral vertu was his speche,
And gladly wolde he lerne, and gladly teche.
A Sergant of the Lawe, war and wis,
That often hadde been at the parvis,
Ther was also, ful riche of excellence.
Discreet he was, and of greet reverence:
He semed swich, his wordes weren so wise.
Justice he was ful often in assise,
By patente, and by plein commissioun;
For his science, and for his heigh renoun
Of fees and robes hadde he many oon.
So greet a purchasour was nowher noon.
Al was fee simple to him in effect,
His purchasing ne might nat been infect.
Nowher so bisy a man as he ther nas,
And yet he semed bisier than he was.
In termes hadde he caas and domes alle,
That from the time of king William were falle.
Therto he coude endite, and make a thing,
Ther coude no wight pinche at his writing;
And every statut coude he plein by rote.
He rood but hoomly in a medlee cote
Girt with a ceint of silk, with barres smale;
Of his array telle I no lenger tale.
A Frankelein was in his compaignie;
Whit was his berd, as is the dayesie.
Of his complexioun he was sangwin.
Wel loved he amorwe a sope in win.
To liven in delit was evere his wone,
For he was Epicurus owne sone,
That heeld opinioun, that plein delit
Was verraily felicitee parfit.
An housholdere, and that a greet, was he;
Seint Julian he was in his contree.
His breed, his ale, was alweys after oon;
A bettre envined man was nowher noon.
Withoute bake mete was nevere his hous,
Of fish and flesh, and that so plenteous,
It snewed in his hous of mete and drinke,
Of alle deintees that men coude thinke.
After the sondry sesons of the yeer,
So chaunged he his mete and his soper.
Ful many a fat partrich hadde he in muwe,
And many a breem and many a luce in stuwe.
Wo was his cook, but if his sauce were
Poinaunt and sharpe, and redy al his gere.
His table dormant in his halle alway
Stood redy covered al the longe day.
At sessiouns ther was he lord and sire;
Ful ofte time he was knight of the shire.
An anlas and a gipser al of silk
Heng at his girdel, whit as morne milk.
A shirreve hadde he been, and a countour;
Was nowher such a worthy vavasour.
An Haberdasshere and a Carpenter,
A Webbe, a Dyere, and a Tapicer,
Were with us eek, clothed in o liveree,
Of a solempne and greet fraternitee.
Ful fresh and newe hir gere apiked was;
Hir knives were ychaped noght with bras,
But al with silver, wroght ful clene and wel,
Hir girdles and hir pouches everydel.
Wel semed ech of hem a fair burgeis,
To sitten in a yeldhalle on a deis.
Everich, for the wisdom that he can,
Was shaply for to been an alderman.
For catel hadde they ynogh and rente,
And eek hir wives wolde it wel assente;
And elles certein were they to blame.
It is ful fair to been yclept âma dame,â
And goon to vigilyÃ«s al bifore,
And have a mantel royalliche ybore.
A Cook they hadde with hem for the nones,
To boil the chiknes with the marybones,
And poudre-marchant tart, and galingale.
Wel coude he knowe a draughte of London ale.
He coude roste, and sethe, and broille, and frye,
Maken mortreux, and wel bake a pye.
But greet harm was it, as it thoughte me,
That on his shine a mormal hadde he;
For blankmanger, that made he with the beste.
A Shipman was ther, woning fer by weste:
For aught I woot, he was of Dertemouthe.
He rood upon a rouncy, as he couthe,
In a gowne of falding to the knee.
A daggere hanginge on a laas hadde he
Aboute his nekke under his arm adoun.
The hote somer maad his hewe al broun;
And, certeinly, he was a good felawe.
Ful many a draughte of win had he ydrawe
Fro Burdeuxward, whil that the chapman sleep.
Of nice conscience took he no keep.
If that he faught, and had the hyer hond,
By water he sente hem hoom to every lond.
But of his craft to reken wel his tides,
His stremes and his daungers him bisides,
His herberwe and his mone, his lodmenage,
Ther nas noon swich from Hulle to Cartage.
Hardy he was, and wis to undertake;
With many a tempest hadde his berd been shake.
He knew wel al the havenes, as they were,
From Gootlond to the cape of Finistere,
And every crike in Britaigne and in Spaine;
His barge ycleped was the Maudelaine.
With us ther was a Doctour of Physik,
In al this world ne was ther noon him lik
To speke of phisik and of surgerie;
For he was grounded in astronomie.
He kepte his pacient a ful greet del
In houres, by his magik naturel.
Wel coude he fortunen the ascendent
Of hise images for his pacient.
He knew the cause of everich maladie,
Were it of hoot or cold, or moiste, or drie,
And where engendred, and of what humour;
He was a verrey parfit practisour.
The cause yknowe, and of his harm the rote,
Anon he yaf the sike man his bote.
Ful redy hadde he hise apothecaries,
To sende him drogges and his letuaries,
For ech of hem made other for to winne;
Hir frendshipe nas nat newe to biginne.
Wel knew he the olde Esculapius,
And Deiscorides, and eek Rufus,
Olde Ypocras, Haly, and Galien;
Serapion, Razis, and Avicen;
Averrois, Damascien, and Constantin;
Bernard, and Gatesden, and Gilbertin.
Of his diet mesurable was he,
For it was of no superfluitee,
But of greet norissing and digestible.
His studie was but litel on the Bible.
In sangwin and in pers he clad was al,
Lined with taffata and with sendal;
And yet he was but esy of dispence;
He kepte that he wan in pestilence.
For gold in phisik is a cordial,
Therfore he loved gold in special.
A good Wif was ther of biside Bathe,
But she was somdel deef, and that was scathe.
Of cloothmaking she hadde swiche an haunt,
She passed hem of Ypres and of Gaunt.
In al the parissh wif ne was ther noon
That to the offring bifore hir sholde goon;
And if ther did, certein, so wrooth was she,
That she was out of alle charitee.
Hir coverchiefs ful fine were of ground;
I dorste swere they weyeden ten pound
That on a Sonday were upon hir heed.
Hir hosen weren of fin scarlet reed,
Ful streite yteid, and shoos ful moiste and newe.
Bold was hir face, and fair, and reed of hewe.
She was a worthy womman al hir live,
Housbondes at chirchedore she hadde five,
Withouten other compaignie in youthe;
But therof nedeth nat to speke as nouthe.
And thries had she been at Jerusalem;
She hadde passed many a straunge strem;
At Rome she hadde been, and at Boloigne,
In Galice at Seint Jame, and at Coloigne.
She coude muche of wandring by the weye.
Gat-tothed was she, soothly for to seye.
Upon an amblere esily she sat,
Ywimpled wel, and on hir heed an hat
As brood as is a bokler or a targe;
A foot-mantel aboute hir hipes large,
And on hir feet a paire of spores sharpe.
In felawschip wel coud she laughe and carpe.
Of remedies of love she knew perchaunce,
For she coude of that art the olde daunce.
A good man was ther of religioun,
And was a povre Parson of a toun;
But riche he was of holy thoght and werk.
He was also a lerned man, a clerk,
That Cristes gospel trewly wolde preche;
His parisshens devoutly wolde he teche.
Benigne he was, and wonder diligent,
And in adversitee ful pacient;
And swich he was ypreved ofte sithes.
Ful looth were him to cursen for his tithes,
But rather wolde he yeven, out of doute,
Unto his povre parisshens aboute
Of his offring, and eek of his substaunce.
He coude in litel thing han suffisaunce.
Wid was his parisshe, and houses fer asonder,
But he ne lafte nat, for rein ne thonder,
In sikness nor in meschief, to visite
The ferreste in his parissh, muche and lite,
Upon his feet, and in his hand a staf.
This noble ensample to his sheep he yaf,
That first he wroghte, and afterward he taughte;
Out of the gospel he tho wordes caughte;
And this figure he added eek therto,
That if gold ruste, what shal iren do?
For if a preest be foul, in whom we truste,
No wonder is a lewed man to ruste;
And shame it is, if that a preest tak keep,
A shiten shepherde and a clene sheep.
Wel ought a preest ensample for to yive,
By his clennesse, how that his sheep shold live.
He sette nat his benefice to hire,
And leet his sheep encombred in the mire,
And ran to London, unto Seinte Poules,
To seken him a chaunterie for soules,
Or with a bretherhed to been withholde;
But dwelte at hoom, and kepte wel his folde,
So that the wolf ne made it nat miscarie;
He was a shepherde and no mercenarie.
And though he holy were, and vertuous,
He was to sinful man nat despitous,
Ne of his spech daungerous ne digne,
But in his teching discreet and benigne.
To drawen folk to heven by fairnesse
By good ensample, was his bisinesse:
But it were any persone obstinat,
Whatso he were, of heigh or lowe estat,
Him wolde he snibben sharply for the nones.
A bettre preest, I trow that nowher noon is.
He waited after no pompe ne reverence,
Ne maked him a spiced conscience,
But Cristes lore, and hise apostles twelve,
He taught, but first he folwed it himselve.
With him ther was a Plowman, was his brother,
That hadde ylad of dong ful many a fother,
A trewe swinkere and a good was he,
Livinge in pees and parfit charitee.
God loved he best with al his hole herte
At alle times thogh him gamed or smerte,
And thanne his neighebour right as himselve.
He wolde thresshe, and therto dike and delve,
For Cristes sake, for every povre wight,
Withouten hire, if it lay in his might.
His tithes payed he ful faire and wel,
Bothe of his propre swink and his catel.
In a tabard he rood upon a mere.
Ther was also a Reve and a Millere,
A Somnour and a Pardoner also,
A Maunciple, myself; ther were namo.
The Miller was a stout carl, for the nones,
Ful big he was of brawn , and eek of bones;
That proved wel, for overal ther he cam,
At wrastlinge he wolde have alwey the ram.
He was short-sholdred, brood, a thikke knarre,
Ther was no door that he nold heve of harre,
Or breke it, at a renning, with his heed.
His berd as any sowe or fox was reed,
And therto brood, as though it were a spade.
Upon the cop right of his nose he hade
A werte, and theron stood a tuft of heres,
Reed as the bristles of a sowes eres;
His nose-thirles blake were and wide.
A swerd and bokler bar he by his side;
His mouth as greet was as a greet forneis.
He was a janglere and a goliardeis,
And that was most of sinne and harlotries.
Wel coude he stelen corn, and tollen thries;
And yet he hadde a thombe of gold, pardee.
A whit cote and a blew hood wered he.
A baggepipe wel coude he blowe and sowne,
And therwithal he broghte us out of towne.
A gentil Maunciple was ther of a Temple,
Of which achatours mighte take exemple
For to be wise in byinge of vitaille.
For whether that he paide, or took by taille,
Algate he waited so in his achat,
That he was ay biforn and in good stat.
Now is nat that of God a ful fair grace,
That swich a lewed mannes wit shal pace
The wisdom of an heepe of lerned men?
Of maistres hadde he mo than thryes ten,
That were of lawe expert and curious;
Of which ther were a dosein in that hous,
Worthy to been stiwardes of rente and lond
Of any lord that is in Engelond,
To make him live by his propre good,
In honour dettelees, but he were wood,
Or live as scarsly as him list desire;
And able for to helpen al a shire
In any cas that mighte falle or happe;
And yit this Maunciple sette hir aller cappe.
The Reve was a sclendre colerik man,
His berd was shave as ny as ever he can.
His heer was by his eres round yshorn.
His top was dokked lik a preest biforn.
Ful longe were his legges, and ful lene,
Ylik a staf, ther was no calf ysene.
Wel coude he kepe a gerner and a binne;
Ther was noon auditour coude on him winne.
Wel wiste he, by the droghte, and by the rein,
The yeldinge of his seed, and of his grein.
His lordes sheepe, his neet, his dayerie,
His swin, his hors, his stoor, and his pultrie,
Was hoolly in this reves governing,
And by his covenaunt he yaf the rekening,
Sin that his lord was twenty yeer of age;
Ther coud no man bringe him in arrerage.
Ther nas baillif, ne herd, nor other hine,
That he ne knew his sleighte and his covine;
They were adrad of him, as of the deeth.
His woning was ful faire upon an heeth,
With grene treÃ«s shadwed was his place.
He coude bettre than his lord purchace.
Ful riche he was astored prively,
His lord wel coude he plesen subtilly,
To yeve and lene him of his owne good,
And have a thank, and yet a cote and hood.
In youthe he lerned hadde a good mister;
He was a wel good wrighte, a carpenter.
This Reve sat upon a ful good stot,
That was al pomely grey, and highte Scot.
A long surcote of pers upon he hade,
And by his side he bar a rusty blade.
Of Northfolk was this reve, of which I telle,
Biside a toun men clepen Baldeswelle.
Tukked he was, as is a frere, aboute,
And evere he rood the hindreste of our route.
A Somnour was ther with us in that place,
That hadde a fir-reed cherubinnes face,
For sawcefleem he was, with eyen narwe.
As hoot he was, and lecherous, as a sparwe;
With scalled browes blake, and piled berd;
Of his visage children were aferd.
Ther nas quiksilver, litarge, ne brimstoon,
Boras, ceruce, ne oille of tartre noon,
Ne oinement that wolde clense and bite,
That him mighte helpen of his whelkes white,
Nor of the knobbes sittinge on his chekes.
Wel loved he garleek, oinons, and eke lekes,
And for to drinken strong win, reed as blood.
Than wolde he speke, and crie as he were wood.
And whan that he wel dronken had the win,
Than wolde he speke no word but Latin.
A fewe termes hadde he, two or three,
That he had lerned out of som decree;
No wonder is, he herde it al the day;
And eek ye knowen wel, how that a jay
Can clepen âWatte,â as well as can the pope.
But whoso coude in other thing him grope,
Thanne hadde he spent al his philosophie;
Ay âQuestio quid iurisâ wolde he crie.
He was a gentil harlot and a kinde;
A bettre felawe sholde men noght finde.
He wolde suffre, for a quart of win,
A good felawe to have his concubin
A twelf-month, and excuse him atte fulle:
Ful prively a finch eek coude he pulle.
And if he fond owher a good felawe,
He wolde techen him to have noon awe,
In swich cas, of the ercedeknes curs,
But if a mannes soule were in his purs;
For in his purs he sholde ypunisshed be.
âPurs is the ercedeknes helle,â seide he.
But wel I woot he lyede right in dede;
Of cursing oght eech gilty man him dredeâ
For curs wol slee, right as assoilling savethâ
And also war him of a significavit.
In daunger hadde he at his owne gise
The yonge girles of the diocise,
And knew hir counseil, and was al hir reed.
A gerland hadde he set upon his heed,
As greet as it were for an ale-stake;
A bokler hadde he maad him of a cake.
With him ther rood a gentil Pardoner
Of Rouncival, his freend and his compeer,
That streight was comen fro the court of Rome.
Ful loude he song, âCom hider, love, to me.â
This Somnour bar to him a stif burdoun,
Was never trompe of half so greet a soun.
This Pardoner had heer as yelow as wex,
But smothe it heng, as dooth a strike of flex;
By ounces henge his lokkes that he hadde,
And therwith he his shuldres overspradde;
But thinne it lay, by colpons oon and oon;
But hood, for jolitee, ne wered he noon,
For it was trussed up in his walet.
Him thoughte, he rood al of the newe jet;
Dischevel, save his cappe, he rood al bare.
Swich glaringe eyen hadde he as an hare.
A vernicle hadde he sowed on his cappe.
His walet lay biforn him in his lappe,
Bretful of pardoun come from Rome al hoot.
A vois he hadde as smal as hath a goot.
No berd hadde he, ne never sholde have,
As smothe it was as it were late yshave;
I trowe he were a gelding or a mare.
But of his craft, fro Berwik into Ware,
Ne was ther swich another pardoner.
For in his male he hadde a pilwe-beer,
Which that, he seide, was our lady veil:
He seide, he hadde a gobet of the seil
That Seinte Peter had, whan that he wente
Upon the see, til Jhesu Crist him hente.
He hadde a crois of latoun, ful of stones,
And in a glas he hadde pigges bones.
But with thise relikes, whanne that he fond
A povre person dwelling upon lond,
Upon a day he gat him more moneie
Than that the parson gat in monthes tweie.
And thus, with feined flaterie and japes,
He made the parson and the peple his apes.
But trewely to tellen, atte laste,
He was in chirche a noble ecclesiaste.
Wel coude he rede a lessoun or a storie,
But alderbest he song an offertorie;
For wel he wiste, whan that song was songe,
He moste preche, and wel affile his tonge,
To winne silver, as he ful wel coude;
Therefore he song the murierly and loude.
Now have I told you shortly, in a clause,
Thâestat, thâarray, the nombre, and the cause
Why that assembled was this compaignie
In Southwerk, at this gentil hostelrie,
That hight the Tabard, faste by the Belle.
But now is time to yow for to telle
How that we baren us that ilke night,
Whan we were in that hostelrie alight.
And after wol I telle of our viage,
And al the remenaunt of our pilgrimage.
But first I pray yow, of your curteisie,
That ye nâarette it nat my vileinie,
Thogh that I pleinly speke in this matere,
To telle yow hir wordes and hir chere;
Ne thogh I speke hir wordes proprely.
For this ye knowen also wel as I,
Whoso shal telle a tale after a man,
He moot reherce, as ny as evere he can,
Everich a word, if it be in his charge,
Al speke he never so rudeliche and large;
Or elles he moot telle his tale untrewe,
Or feine thing, or finde wordes newe.
He may nat spare, althogh he were his brother;
He moot as wel seie o word as another.
Crist spak himself ful brode in holy writ,
And wel ye woot, no vileinie is it.
Eek Plato seith, whoso that can him rede,
The wordes moot be cosin to the dede.
Also I prey yow to foryeve it me,
Al have I nat set folk in hir degree
Here in this tale, as that they sholde stonde;
My wit is short, ye may wel understonde.
Greet cheere made our host us everichon,
And to the soper sette he us anon;
And served us with vitaille at the beste.
Strong was the win, and wel to drinke us leste.
A semely man Our Hoste was withalle
For to han been a marchal in an halle;
A large man he was with eyen stepe,
A fairer burgeis is ther noon in Chepe:
Bold of his speche, and wis, and wel ytaught,
And of manhod him lakkede right naught.
Eek therto he was right a mury man,
And after soper pleyen he bigan,
And spak of mirthe amonges othere thinges,
Whan that we hadde maad our rekeninges;
And seide thus: âNow, lordinges, trewely,
Ye been to me right welcom hertely:
For by my trouthe, if that I shal nat lie,
I ne saugh this yeer so mery a companye
At ones in this herberwe as is now.
Fain wolde I doon yow mirthe, wiste I how.
And of a mirthe I am right now bithoght,
To doon yow ese, and it shal coste noght.
Ye goon to Caunterbury; God yow spede,
The blisful martir quite yow your mede.
And wel I woot, as ye goon by the weye,
Ye shapen yow to talen and to pleye;
For trewely, confort ne mirthe is noon
To ride by the weye doumb as a stoon;
And therfor wol I maken yow disport,
As I seide erst, and doon yow som confort.
And if yow liketh al, by oon assent,
Now for to stonden at my jugement,
And for to werken as I shal yow seye,
Tomorwe, whan ye riden by the weye,
Now, by my fader soule, that is deed,
But ye be mery, I wol yeve yow min heed.
Hold up your hond, withouten more speche.â
Our counseil was nat longe for to seche;
Us thoughte it was noght worth to make it wis,
And graunted him withouten more avis,
And bad him seye his voirdit, as him leste.
âLordinges,â quod he, ânow herkneth for the beste;
But tak it not, I prey yow, in desdein;
This is the point, to speken short and plein,
That ech of yow, to shorte with our weye,
In this viage, shal telle tales tweye,
To Caunterbury-ward, I mene it so,
And homward he shal tellen othere two,
Of aventures that whilom han bifalle.
And which of yow that bereth him best of alle,
That is to seyn, that telleth in this cas
Tales of best sentence and most solas,
Shal have a soper at oure aller cost
Here in this place, sitting by this post,
Whan that we come again fro Caunterbury.
And for to make yow the more mury,
I wol myselven goodly with yow ride,
Right at min owne cost, and be your gide.
And whoso wol my jugement withseye
Shal paye al that we spenden by the weye.
And if ye vouchesauf that it be so,
Tel me anon, withouten wordes mo,
And I wol erly shape me therfore.â
This thing was graunted, and our othes swore
With ful glad herte, and preiden him also
That he wold vouchesauf for to do so,
And that he wolde been our governour,
And of our tales juge and reportour,
And sette a soper at a certein pris;
And we wold ruled been at his devis,
In heigh and lowe; and thus, by oon assent,
We been acorded to his jugement.
And therupon the win was fet anon;
We dronken, and to reste wente echon,
Withouten any lenger taryinge.
Amorwe, whan that day bigan to springe,
Up roos our host, and was our aller cok,
And gadrede us togidre, in a flok,
And forth we riden, a litel more than pas,
Unto the Watering of Seint Thomas
And there our host bigan his hors areste,
And seide; âLordinges, herkneth, if yow leste.
Ye woot your forward, and it yow recorde.
If even-song and morwe-song acorde,
Lat se now who shal tell the firste tale.
As ever mote I drinke win or ale,
Whoso be rebel to my jugement
Shal pay for al that by the wey is spent.
Now draweth cut, er that we ferrer twinne;
He which that hath the shortest shal biginne.
Sir knight,â quod he, âmy maister and my lord,
Now draweth cut, for that is min acord.
Comth neer,â quod he, âmy lady prioresse;
And ye, sir clerk, lat be your shamfastnesse,
Ne studieth noght; ley hond to, every man.â
Anon to drawen every wight bigan,
And shortly for to tellen, as it was,
Were it by aventure, or sort, or cas,
The sothe is this, the cut fil to the Knight,
Of which ful blithe and glad was every wight;
And telle he moste his tale, as was resoun,
By forward and by composicioun,
As ye han herd; what nedeth wordes mo?
And whan this goode man saugh it was so,
As he that wis was and obedient
To kepe his forward by his free assent,
He seide: âSin I shal bigin the game,
What, welcom be the cut, a Goddes name!
Now lat us ride, and herkneth what I seye.â
And with that word we riden forth our weye;
And he bigan with right a mery chere
His tale anon, and seyde in this manere.
