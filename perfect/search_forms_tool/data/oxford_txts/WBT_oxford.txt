¶In th’olde dayes of the king Arthour,
Of which that Britons speken greet honour,
All was this land fulfild of faierie.°
The elf-queen, with hir joly° compaignie,
Daunced ful ofte in many a grene mede;°
This was the olde opinion, as I rede,°
I speke of manie hundred yeres ago;
But now can no man see none elves mo.
For now the grete charitee and prayeres
Of limitours° and othere holy freres,
That serchen° every lond and every streem,
As thikke as motes° in the sonne-beem,
Blessinge halls, chambres, kichens, boures,°
Citees, burghes,° castels, hye toures,
Thropes, bernes, shipnes, dayeries,°
This° maketh° that ther been no fayeries.
For ther° as wont to walken was° an elf,
Ther walketh now the limitour himself
In undermeles° and in morweninges,
And seith his matins° and his holy thinges
As he goth in his limitacioun.
Wommen may go now saufly up and doun,
In every bush, or under every tree;
Ther is noon other incubus° but he,
And he ne wol doon hem but dishonour.

¶And so bifel it, that this king Arthour
Hadde in his hous a lusty° bacheler,°
That on a day cam ridinge fro river;°
And happed° that, allone as she was born,
He saugh a maide° walkinge him biforn,
Of whiche maide anon,° maugree hir heed,°
By verray° force he rafte hir° maidenheed;°
For which oppressioun° was swich clamour
And swich pursute° unto the king Arthour,
That dampned° was this knight for to be deed
By cours of lawe, and sholde han lost his heed
Paraventure,° swich was the statut° tho;°
But that the quene and other ladies mo
So longe preyeden the king of grace,
Til he his lif° him graunted in the place,
And yaf° him to the quene al at hir wille,
To chees,° whether she wolde him save or spille.°

¶The quene thanketh the king with al hir might,
And after this thus spak she to the knight,
Whan that she saw hir time, upon a day:
“Thou standest yet,” quod she, “in swich array,°
That of thy lif yet hastow no suertee.°
I grant thee lif, if thou canst tellen me,
What thing is it that wommen most desiren.
Be war,° and keep thy nekke-boon from iren.°
And if thou canst nat tellen it anon,°
Yet wol I yeve thee leve° for to gon
A twelf-month and a day, to seche and lere°
An answer suffisant in this matere.
And suertee° wol I han, er that thou pace,
Thy body for to yelden° in this place.”

¶Wo was this knight and sorwfully he siketh;°
But what! he may nat do al as him liketh.°
And at the laste, he chees° him for to wende,°
And come again, right at the yeres ende,
With swich answere as God wolde him purveye;°
And taketh his leve, and wendeth forth his weye.

¶He seketh every hous and every place,
Whereas he hopeth for to finde grace,
To lerne, what thing wommen loven most;
But he ne coude arriven in no cost,°
Wheras he mighte finde in this matere
Two creatures accordinge infere.°
Som seide, wommen loven best richesse,
Som seide, honour, som seide, jolinesse;
Som, riche array,° som seiden, lust abedde,
And ofte time to be widwe° and wedde.
Somme seide, that our hertes been most esed,
Whan that we been yflatered° and yplesed.
He gooth ful ny° the sothe,° I wol nat lie;
A man shal winne us best with flaterie;
And with attendance,° and with bisinesse,
Been we ylimed,° bothe more and lesse.°

¶And somme seyn, how that we loven best
For to be free, and do right as us lest,°
And that no man repreve° us of our vice,°
But sey that we be wise, and nothing nice.°
For trewely, ther is noon of us alle,
If any wight° wol clawe us on the galle,°
That we nil kike,° for he seith us sooth;
Assay, and he shal finde it that so dooth.
For be we never so vicious withinne,
We wol° been holden° wise, and clene of sinne.°

¶And somme seyn, that greet delit han we
For to ben holden stable and eek secree,°
And in o purpos stedfastly to dwelle,
And nat biwreye° thing that men us telle.
But that tale is nat worth a rake-stele;°
Pardee, we wommen conne° nothing hele;°
Witnesse on Mida; wol ye heer the tale?

¶Ovide, amonges other thinges° smale,°
Seid, Mida hadde, under his longe heres,°
Growinge upon his heed two asses eres,
The whiche vice° he hidde, as he best mighte,
Ful subtilly° from every mannes sighte,
That, save° his wif, ther wiste° of it namo.°
He loved hir most, and trusted hir also;
He preyed hir,° that to no creature
She sholde tellen of his disfigure.

¶She swoor him nay, for al this world to winne,
She nolde do that vileinie or sinne,
To make hir housbonde han so foul a name;
She wold nat° telle it for hir owne shame.
But nathelees, hir thoughte° that she dide,°
That she so longe sholde a conseil° hide;
Hir thoughte it swal° so sore aboute hir herte,
That nedely° som word hir moste asterte;°
And sith° she dorste° telle it to no man,
Doun to a maris° faste by° she ran;
Til she cam there, hir herte was afire,
And, as a bitor° bombleth° in the mire,
She leide hir mouth unto the water doun:
“Biwreie° me nat, thou water, with thy soun,”
Quod she, “to thee I telle it, and namo;
Min housbonde hath long asses eres two!
Now is min herte all hool, now is it oute;
I might no lenger kepe it, out of doute,”°
Heer may ye se, thogh we a time abide,°
Yet out it moot,° we can no conseil° hide;
The remenant of the tale if ye wol heere,
Redeth Ovide, and ther ye may it lere.°

¶This knight, of which my tale is specially,
Whan that he saugh he might nat com therby,
This is to sey, what wommen loven moost,
Withinne his brest ful sorweful was the goost;°
But hoom he gooth, he mighte nat soyourne.°
The day was com that hoomward moste he tourne,°
And in his wey it happed him° to ride,
In al this care,° under a forest-side,°
Wheras he saugh upon a daunce go
Of ladies foure and twenty, and yet mo;°
Toward the whiche daunce he drow° ful yerne,°
In hope that som wisdom sholde he lerne.
But certeinly, er° he cam fully there,°
Vanisshed was this daunce, he niste° where.
No creature saugh he that bar lif,°
Save on the grene he saugh sittinge a wif;
A fouler wight° ther may no man devise.°
Again° the knight this olde wif gan rise,
And seid, “Sir knight, heerforth° ne lith° no wey.
Tel me what that ye seken, by your fey.°
Paraventure it may the bettre be;
Thise olde folk can muchel thing,”° quod she.

¶“My leve mooder,”° quod this knight certein,
“I nam but deed,° but if° that I can seyn
What thing it is that wommen most desire;
Coud ye me wisse,° I wold wel quit your hire.”°

¶“Plight° me thy trouth,° heer in min hand,” quod she,
“The nexte thing that I requere thee,
Thou shalt it do, if it lie in thy might;
And I wol telle it yow er it be night.”

¶“Have heer my trouthe,” quod the knight, “I grante.”
“Than,” quod she, “I dar me wel avante,°
Thy lif is sauf, for I wol stonde therby,
Upon my lif, the queen wol seye as I.°
Lat see which is the proudeste of hem alle,
That wereth on° a coverchief or calle,°
That dar sey nay, of that I shal thee teche;
Lat us go forth withouten lenger speche.”
Tho rouned° she a pistel° in his ere,
And bad him to be glad, and have no fere.

¶Whan they be comen to the court, this knight
Seide, he had holde his day, as he had hight,°
And redy was his answere, as he saide.
Ful many a noble wif, and many a maide,°
And many a widwe,° for that they ben wise,
The queene hirself sittinge as a justise,°
Assembled been, his answere for to here;
And afterward this knight was bode° appere.

¶To every wight° comanded was silence,
And that the knight shold telle in audience,°
What thing that worldly wommen loven best.
This knight ne stood nat stille as doth a best,°
But to his questioun anon° answerde
With manly vois, that al the court it herde:

¶“My lige lady, generally,”° quod he,
“Wommen desiren to have sovereintee°
As wel over hir housbond as hir love,°
And for to been in maistrie° him above;
This is your most desir, thogh ye me kille.
Doth as yow list,° I am here at your wille.”
In al the court ne was ther wif ne maide,
Ne widwe, that contraried° that he saide,
But seiden he was worthy han his lif.

¶And with that word up stirt° the olde wif,
Which that the knight saugh sittinge in the grene:
“Mercy,” quod she, “my soverein lady quene!
Er that your court departe, do me right.°
I taughte this answere unto the knight;
For which he plighte me his trouthe° there,
The firste thing I wolde of him requere,
He wolde it do, if it lay in his might.
Bifor the court than preye I thee, sir knight,”
Quod she, “that thou me take unto thy wif;
For wel thou wost° that I have kept° thy lif.
If I sey fals, sey nay, upon thy fey!”

¶This knight answerde, “Allas! and weilawey!
I woot right wel that swich was my biheste.°
For Goddes love, as chees° a new requeste;
Tak al my good,° and lat my body go.”

¶“Nay than,” quod she, “I shrewe° us bothe two!
For thogh that I be foul, and olde, and pore,
I nold° for al the metal,° ne for ore,
That under erthe is grave, or lith above,
But if thy wif I were, and eek thy love.”

¶“My love?” quod he; “Nay, my dampnacioun!
Allas! that any of my nacioun°
Sholde ever so foul disparaged° be!”
But al for noght, th&apos;ende is this, that he
Constreined was, he nedes moste hir wedde;
And taketh his olde wif, and gooth to bedde.

¶Now wolden som men sey, paraventure,
That, for my necligence, I do no cure°
To tellen yow the joye and al th’array°
That at the feste° was that ilke day.
To whiche thing shortly answere I shal:
I sey, ther nas no joy ne feste at al,
Ther nas but hevinesse and much sorwe;
For prively° he wedded hir on morwe,°
And al day after hidde him as an oule;°
So wo was him, his wif looked so foule.

¶Greet was the wo the knight hadde in his thoght,
Whan he was with his wif abedde ybroght;
He walweth,° and he turneth to and fro.
His olde wif lay smilinge evermo,
And seide, “O dere housbond, benedicite!
Fareth every knight thus with his wif as ye?
Is this the lawe of king Arthures hous?
Is every knight of his so dangerous?°
I am your owne love and eek° your wif;
I am she, which that saved hath your lif;
And certes, yet did I yow never unright;°
Why fare ye thus with me this firste night?
Ye faren lik a man had lost his wit;
What is my gilt? for Goddes love, tel it,
And it shal been amended, if I may.”

¶“Amended?” quod this knight, “Allas! nay, nay!
It wol nat been amended never mo!
Thou art so loothly,° and so old also,
And therto comen of so lowe a kinde,°
That litel wonder is, thogh I walwe and winde.°
So wolde God min herte wolde breste!”°

¶“Is this,” quod she, “the cause of your unreste?”
“Ye, certainly,” quod he, “no wonder is.”

¶“Now, sir,” quod she, “I coude amende al this,
If that me liste,° er it were dayes three,
So° wel ye mighte bere yow unto me.

¶“But for ye speken of swich gentillesse°
As is descended out of old richesse,
That therfore sholden ye be gentil° men,
Swich arrogance is nat worth an hen.
Lok who that is most vertuous alway,
Privee and apert,° and most entendeth ay°
To do the gentil dedes that he can,
And tak him for the grettest gentil man.
Crist wol° we claime of° him our gentillesse,
Nat of oure eldres for hir old richesse.
For thogh they yeve° us al hir heritage,
For which we claim to been of heigh parage,°
Yet may they nat biquethe, for nothing,°
To noon of us hir vertuous living,
That made hem gentil men ycalled be;
And bad° us folwen hem in swich degree.°

¶“Wel can the wise poete of Florence,
That highte° Dant, speken in this sentence;°
Lo in swich maner rim° is Dantes tale:
‘Ful selde up riseth by his branches smale°
Prowesse° of man, for God, of his goodnesse,
Wol that of him° we claime our gentillesse’;
For of our eldres may we nothing claime
But temporel° thing, that man may hurte° and maime.°

¶“ ‘Eek every wight° wot° this as wel as I,
If gentiless wer planted naturelly
Unto a certein linage, doun the line,
Privee ne apert,° than wold they never fine°
To doon of gentiles the faire office;°
They mighte do no vileinie or vice.

¶“ ‘Taak fir,° and ber it in the derkest hous
Bitwix this° and the mount of Kaucasous,°
And lat men shet the dores and go thenne;°
Yet wol the fir as faire lie° and brenne,°
As twenty thousand men mighte it biholde;
His office naturel° ay wol it holde,
Up peril of my lif, til that it die.

¶“ ‘Heer may ye see wel, how that genterie°
Is nat annexed to possessioun,
Sith folk ne doon hir operacioun°
Alwey, as dooth the fir, lo! in his kinde.°
For, God it woot,° men may wel often finde
A lordes son do shame and vileinie;
And he that wol han pris of° his gentrie
For he was boren of a gentil hous,°
And hadde hise eldres noble and vertuous,
And nil° himselven do no gentil dedis,
Ne folwe his gentil auncestre that deed° is,
He nis nat gentil, be he duk or erl;
For vileins sinful dedes make a cherl.°
For gentillesse nis but renomee°
Of thine auncestres, for hir heigh bountee,°
Which is a strange thing to° thy persone.
Thy gentillesse comth fro God allone;
Than comth our verray° gentillesse of grace,
It was nothing biquethe° us with our place.°

¶“ ‘Thenketh how noble, as seith Valerius,
Was thilke Tullius Hostilius,
That out of povert roos to heigh noblesse.
Redeth Senek,° and redeth eek Boëce,
Ther shul ye seen expres° that it no drede is,°
That he is gentil that doth gentil dedis;
And therfor, leve° housbond, I thus conclude,
Al were° it that mine auncestres were rude,°
Yet may the hye God, and so hope I,
Grant me grace to liven vertuously.
Thanne am I gentil, whan that I biginne
To liven vertuously and weive° sinne.

¶“ ‘And theras ye of povert me repreve,°
The hye God, on whom that we bileve,
In wilful° povert chees° to live his lif.
And certes every man, maiden, or wif,
May understond that Jesus, heven king,
Ne wolde nat chese a vicious° living.
Glad poverte is an honest thing, certein;
This wol Senek and other clerkes seyn.
Whoso that halt him° paid° of his poverte,
I holde° him riche, al° hadde he nat a sherte.
He that coveiteth is a poure wight,
For he wolde han that° is nat in his might.
But he that noght hath, ne coveiteth have,
Is riche, although ye holde him but a knave.°

¶“ ‘Verray povert,° it singeth proprely;°
Juvenal seith of povert merily:
“The poure man, whan he goth by the weye,
Bifor the theves he may singe and pleye.”
Poverte is hateful good, and, as I gesse,
A ful greet bringer out° of bisinesse;°
A greet amender eek of sapience°
To him that taketh it in pacience.
Povert is this, although it seme elenge:°
Possessioun,° that no wight wol chalenge.°
Povert ful ofte, whan a man is lowe,
Maketh his God and eek himself to knowe.
Povert a spectacle° is, as thinketh me,
Thurgh which he may his verray° frendes see.
And therfor, sir, sin° that I noght yow greve,°
Of my povert namore ye me repreve.°

¶“Now, sire, of elde° ye repreve me;
And certes, sir, thogh noon auctoritee°
Were in no book, ye gentils of honour
Seyn that men sholde an old wight° doon favour,°
And clepe° him fader, for° your gentillesse;
And auctours shal I finden, as I gesse.

¶“Now ther° ye sey, that I am foul and old,
Than drede you noght to been a cokewold;°
For filthe and elde, also moot I thee,°
Been grete wardeins upon° chastitee.

¶“But nathelees, sin I know your delit,
I shal fulfill your worldly° appetit.
Chees now,” quod she, “oon of thise thinges tweie,
To han me foul and old til that I deie,
And be to yow a trewe° humble wif,
And never yow displese in al my lif,
Or elles ye wol han me yong and fair,
And tak your aventure° of the repair°
That shal be to your hous, bicause of me,
Or in som other place, may wel be.
Now chees yourselven, wheither° that yow liketh.”

¶This knight aviseth° him and sore siketh,°
But atte laste he seide in this manere,
“My lady and my love, and wif so dere,
I put me in your wise governance;
Cheseth yourself, which may be most plesance,
And most honour to yow and me also.
I do no fors° the wheither° of the two;
For as yow liketh, it suffiseth me.”

¶“Thanne have I gete of yow maistrie,” quod she,
“Sin I may chese, and governe as me lest?”°
“Ye, certes, wif,” quod he, “I holde° it best.”

¶“Kis me,” quod she, “we be no lenger wrothe;°
For, by my trouthe, I wol be to yow bothe,
This is to seyn, ye, bothe fair and good.
I prey to God that I mot sterven wood,°
But° I to yow be also good and trewe
As ever was wif, sin that the world was newe.
And, but° I be tomorn as fair to sene
As any lady, emperice, or quene,
That is bitwix° the est and eke the west,
Doth with my lif and deeth right as yow lest.°
Cast up the curtin,° look how that it is.”

¶And whan the knight saugh verraily al this,
That she so fair was, and so yong therto,°
For joye he hente° hire in his armes two,
His herte bathed in a bath of blisse;
A thousand time arewe° he gan hir kisse.
And she obeyed him in every thing
That mighte doon him plesance or liking.

¶And thus they live, unto hir lives ende,
In parfit° joye; and Jhesu Crist us sende
Housbondes meke, yonge, and fresshe abedde,
And grace t’overbide° hem that we wedde.
And eek I praye Jhesu shorte hir lives
That wol not be governed by hir wives;
And olde and angry nigards° of dispence,
God sende hem soone verray pestilence.
