¶“Experience, though noon auctoritee°
Were in this world, is right inogh° for me
To speke of wo that is in mariage;
For, lordings, sith° I twelf yeer was of age,
Ythonked be God that is eterne on live,°
Housbonds at chirche-dore I have had five;
For I so ofte have ywedded be;
And al were worthy men in hir degree.°
But me was told certein, nat longe agon is,
That sith that Crist ne went never but onis°
To wedding in the Cane° of Galilee,
That by the same ensample taughte he me
That I ne sholde wedded be but ones.
Herkne eek, lo! which° a sharp° word for the nones°
Beside a welle Jesus, God and man,
Spak in repreve° of the Samaritan:
‘Thou hast yhad five housbonds,’ seide he,
‘And thilke° man, the which that hath now thee,
Is noght thin housbond’; thus seide he certein;
What that he ment therby, I can nat seyn;°
But that I ax,° why that the fifthe man
Was noon housbond to the Samaritan?
How manie° might she have in mariage?
Yet herde I never tellen in min age
Upon this nombre diffinicioun;°
Men may devine° and glosen° up and doun.
But wel I woot° expres,° withoute lie,
God bad us for to wexe° and multiplie;
That gentil° text can I wel understonde.
Eek° wel I woot he seide, min housbonde
Shold lete° fader and moder, and take me;
But of no nombre mencioun made he,
Of bigamie or of octogamie;°
Why sholde men speke of it vileinie?°

¶“Lo, here° the wise king, dan° Salomon;
I trowe° he hadde wives mo than oon;
As, wolde° God, it lefful° were to me
To be refresshed half so ofte as he!
Which yifte of° God hadde he for alle his wivis!
No man hath swich,° that in this world alive is.
God woot,° this noble king, as to my wit,
The firste night had many a mery fit°
With ech of hem, so wel was him on live!°
Yblessed be° God that I have wedded five!
Welcom the sixte, whan that ever he shal.
For sothe,° I wol nat kep me chast in al;
Whan min housbond is fro the world ygon,°
Som Cristen man shal wedde me anon;
For than th’apostle° seith, that I am free
To wedde, a Goddes half,° wher it liketh me.°
He seith that to be wedded is no sinne;
Bet is to be wedded than to brinne.°
What rekketh me,° thogh folk sey vileinie°
Of shrewed° Lameth and his bigamie?
I woot° wel Abraham was an holy man,
And Jacob eek, as ferforth° as I can;°
And ech of hem had wives mo than two;
And many another holy man also.
Whan saugh ye evere, in any maner age,
That heighe God defended° mariage
By expres° word? I pray you, telleth me;
Or wher comanded he virginitee?
I woot as wel as ye, it is no drede,°
Th’Apostel, whan he speketh of maidenhede;°
He seid, that precept therof hadde he noon.
Men may conseille a womman to been oon,°
But conseilling nis° no comandement;
He putte it in our owne jugement.
For hadde God comanded maidenhede,
Thanne hadde he dampned wedding with the dede;
And certes, if ther were no seed ysowe,
Virginitee, wherof than sholde it growe?
Poul dorste° nat comanden atte leste°
A thing of which his maister yaf° noon heste.°
The dart is set up° for virginitee;
Cacch° who so may, who renneth° best lat see.

¶“But this word is nat take of° every wight,
But ther as God list° give it of his might.
I woot° wel, that th’Apostel was a maide;°
But natheless, thogh that° he wroot and saide,
He wold° that every wight° were swich° as he,
Al nis but° conseil to virginitee;
And for to been a wif, he yaf me leve°
Of indulgence; so nis it no repreve°
To wedde me, if that my make° die,
Withoute excepcioun of° bigamie.
Al were° it good no womman for to touche,
He mente as in his bed or in his couche;
For peril is° both fir and tow° t’assemble;
Ye know what this ensample may resemble.°
This al and som, he heeld virginitee
Mor parfit° than wedding in freletee.°
Freeltee clepe I, but if° that he and she
Wold leden al hir lif in chastitee.
I graunte it wel, I have noon envie,°
Thogh maidenhed preferre° bigamie;
Hem liketh° to be clene,° body and goost,°
Of min estaat° I nil nat make no boost.
For wel ye knowe, a lord in his houshold,
He hath nat every vessel al of gold;
Som been of tree,° and doon hir lord servise.
God clepeth° folk to him in sondry° wise,
And everich hath of God a propre yifte,°
Som this, som that,—as him it liketh shifte.°

¶“Virginitee is greet perfeccioun,
And continence° eek with devocioun.
But Crist, that of perfeccioun is welle,°
Bad° nat every wight he shold go selle
All that he hadde, and give it to the pore,
And in swich wise° folwe him and his fore.°
He spak to hem that wold live parfitly;°
And lordinges, by your leve,° that am nat I.
I wol bistow the flour° of al min age°
In th’actes and in fruit of mariage.

¶“Tell me also, to what conclusioun
Were membres° maad of generacioun,°
And for what profit was a wight ywroght?°
Trusteth right wel, they wer nat maad for noght.
Glose° whoso wole,° and sey bothe up and doun,
That they were maked for purgacioun
Of urine, and our bothe thinges smal°
Were eek° to knowe a femele from a male,
And for noone other cause: sey ye no?
Th’experience woot° wel it is noght so;
So that the clerkes° be nat with me wrothe,
I sey this, that they maked been for bothe,
That is to sey, for office,° and for ese°
Of engendrure,° ther° we nat God displese.
Why sholde men els in hir bokes sette,°
That man shal yelde° to his wif hir dette?°
Now wherwith° sholde he make his payement,
If he ne used his sely° instrument?
Than were they maad upon a creature,
To purge urine, and eek for engendrure.

¶“But I sey noght that every wight° is holde,°
That hath swich harneis° as I to yow tolde,
To goon and usen hem in engendrure;
Than shold men take of chastitee no cure.°
Crist was a maide,° and shapen as a man,
And many a seint, sith that the world bigan,
Yet lived they evere in parfit° chastitee.
I nil nat envie° no virginitee;
Lat hem be breed° of pured° whete-seed,°
And lat us wives hoten° barly-breed;°
And yet with barly-breed, Mark telle can,
Our Lord, Jesu, refresshed many a man.
In swich° estaat as God hath cleped° us
I wol persevere, I nam nat precius.°
In wifhode I wol use min instrument
As frely° as my maker hath it sent.
If I be daungerous,° God yeve me sorwe!
Min housbond shal it han bothe eve and morwe,
Whan that him list° com forth and paye his dette.
An housbonde I wol have, I nil nat lette,°
Which shal be both my dettour° and my thral,°
And have his tribulacioun withal
Upon his flessh, whil that I am his wif.
I have the power duringe al my lif
Upon his propre° body, and noght° he.
Right thus th’Apostel tolde it unto me;
And bad° our housbonds for to love us weel.
Al this sentence° me liketh every-deel”—

¶Up stert the Pardoner, and that anon,°
“Now dame,” quod he, “by God and by Seint John,
Ye been a noble prechour in this cas!
I was about to wedde a wif; allas!
What° sholde I bye° it on my flesh so dere?°
Yet hadde I lever° wed no wif toyere!”°

¶“Abid!”° quod she, “my tale is nat bigonne;
Nay, thou shalt drinken of another tonne°
Er that I go, shal savour° wors than ale.
And whan that I have told thee forth my tale
Of tribulacioun in mariage,
Of which I am expert in al min age,
This to seyn, myself have been the whippe;—
Than maystow chese whether thou wolt sippe
Of thilke tonne° that I shal abroche.°
Be war of it, er thou to neigh° approche;
For I shal telle ensamples mo than ten.
‘Whoso that nil be war° by other men,
By him shul other men corrected be.’
The same wordes writeth Ptholomee;
Rede in his Almageste, and take it there.”

¶“Dame, I wold pray yow, if your wil it were,”
Seid this Pardoner, “as ye bigan,
Tell forth your tale, spareth° for no man,
And teche us yonge men of your praktike.”°

¶“Gladly,” quod she, “sith° it may yow like.°
But yet I pray to al this compaignie,
If that I speke after my fantasie,°
As taketh not agrief° of that° I seye;
For min entente° nis but° for to pleye.

¶“Now sires, now wol I tel forth my tale.—
As ever mote° I drinken win or ale,
I shal sey sooth, tho housbonds that I hadde,
As three of hem were goode and two were badde.
The three men were goode, and riche, and olde;
Unnethe° mighte they the statut° holde
In which that they wer bounden unto me.
Ye woot° wel what I mene of this, pardee!°
As help me God, I laughe whan I thinke
How pitously anight I made hem swinke;°
And by my fey,° I tolde° of it no stoor.°
They had me yeven° hir land and hir tresoor;°
Me neded nat do lenger diligence°
To winne hir love, or doon° hem reverence.°
They loved me so wel, by God above,
That I ne told no deintee° of hir love!
A wis womman wol sette hir ever in oon°
To gete hir love, ther as° she hath noon.
But sith° I hadde hem hoolly° in min hond,
And sith they had me yeven° all hir lond,
What° sholde I taken hede° hem for to plese,
But it were° for my profit and min ese?°
I sette hem so awerke, by my fey,°
That many a night they songen ‘Weilawey!’°
The bacoun was nat fet° for hem, I trowe,°
That som men han in Essexe at Dunmowe.
I governed hem so wel, after my lawe,
That ech of hem ful blisful was and fawe°
To bring me gaye thinges fro the faire.
They were ful glad whan I spak to hem faire;°
For God it woot,° I chidde° hem spitously.°

¶“Now herkneth, how I bar me proprely,°
Ye wise wives, that can understonde.
Thus shul ye speke and bere hem wrong on honde;°
For half so boldely can ther no man
Swere° and lyen as a womman can.
I sey nat this by wives that ben wise,
But if° it be whan they hem misavise.°
A wise wif, if that she can hir good,°
Shal beren him on hond° the cow° is wood,°
And take witnesse of hir owne maide
Of hir assent;° but herkneth how I saide.

¶“ ‘Sir olde kainard,° is this thin array?
Why is my neighebores wif so gay?°
She is honoured overal ther° she goth;
I sitte at hoom, I have no thrifty° cloth.
What dostow° at my neighebores hous?
Is she so fair? artow so amorous?
What rown° ye with our maide? benedicite!°
Sir olde lechour, lat thy japes° be!
And if I have a gossib° or a freend,
Withouten gilt, thou chidest as a feend,°
If that I walke or pleye unto his hous!
Thou comest hoom as dronken as a mous,
And prechest on thy bench, with ivel preef!°

¶“ ‘Thou seyst to me, it is a greet meschief°
To wedde a povre womman, for costage;°
And if that she be riche, of heigh parage,°
Than seystow that it is a tormentrie
To suffre hir pride and hir malencolie.°
And if that she be fair, thou verray knave,°
Thou seyst that every holour° wol hir have;
She may no while in chastitee abide,
That is assailled upon ech a side.

¶“ ‘Thou seyst, som folk desire us for richesse,
Som for our shap, and som for our fairnesse;
And som for she can outher° singe or daunce,
And som for gentillesse and daliaunce;°
Som for hir handes and hir armes smale;°

Thou seyst, men may nat kepe° a castel wal;

What eileth° swich an old man for to chide?
Thow seyst, we wives wol our vices hide

Wel may that be a proverbe of a shrewe!°

¶“ ‘Thou seyst, that oxen, asses, hors, and houndes,

But folk of wives maken noon assay°

And than, seystow, we wol our vices shewe.
Thou seyst also, that it displeseth me
But if° that thou wolt preise my beautee,

¶“ ‘Of alle men yblessed moot° he be,

By this proverbe thou shalt understonde,

And sey thise wordes in the apostles name,

Thou liknest it also to wilde fir;

Thou seyst, that right as wormes shende° a tree,

¶“Lordings, right thus, as ye han understonde,
Bar I stif° min housebondes on honde,°
That thus they seiden in hir dronkenesse;
And al was fals, but that I took witnesse
On Janekin and on my nece also.
O Lord, the pine° I dide hem and the wo,
Ful giltelees, by Goddes swete pine!°
For as an hors I coude bite and whine.°
I coude pleine,° and° I was in the gilt,
Or elles° often time hadde I ben spilt.°
Whoso that first to mille comth, first grint;°

Of thing of which they never agilte° hir live.

¶“Of wenches wolde I beren him on honde,°

Yet tikled it his herte, for that he
Wend° that I hadde of him so greet chiertee.°

Under that colour° hadde I many a mirthe.
For al swich° wit is yive us in our birthe;
Deceite, weping, spinning God hath yive°

And thus of o thing I avaunte me,°
At ende I had the bet° in ech degree,°
By sleighte,° or force, or by som maner thing,
As by continuel murmur or grucching;°
Namely° a° bedde hadden they meschaunce,
Ther wolde I chide and do hem no plesaunce;
I wold no lenger in the bed abide,

Than wolde I suffre him do his nicetee.°
And therfore every man this tale I telle,
Win whoso may, for al is for to selle.
With empty hand men may noon haukes lure;°
For winning° wolde I al his lust endure,

And yet in bacon° hadde I never delit;
That made me that ever I wolde hem chide.

For by my trouthe, I quitte° hem word for word.
As help me verray God omnipotent,
Thogh° I right now shold make my testament,
I ne owe hem nat a word that it nis quit.
I broghte it so aboute by my wit,
That they most yeve it up,° as for the beste;
Or elles had we never been in reste.
For thogh he looked as a wood leoun,°
Yet sholde he faille of his conclusioun.

¶“Than wolde I seye, ‘Goode lief,° taak keep°
How mekly looketh Wilkin oure sheep;
Com neer, my spouse, lat me ba° thy cheke!

But I wol kepe it for your owne tooth.°
Ye be to blame, by God, I sey yow sooth.’°
Swich maner wordes hadde we on honde.
Now wol I speken of my fourth housbonde.

¶“My fourthe housbond was a revelour,
This is to seyn, he hadde a paramour;°
And I was yong and ful of ragerie,°
Stibourne° and strong, and joly° as a pie.°
Wel coude I daunce to an harpe smale,
And singe, ywis, as any nightingale,
Whan I had dronke a draughte of sweete win.
Metellius, the foule cherl,° the swin,°
That with a staf birafte° his wif hir lif,
For she drank win, thogh° I had been his wif,
Ne sholde nat han daunted me fro° drinke;
And, after win, on Venus moste I thinke:
For al so siker° as cold° engendreth hail,
A likerous° mouth moste han a likerous° tail.
In° womman vinolent° is no defence,°
This knowen lechours by experience.

¶“But, Lord Crist! whan that it remembreth me
Upon my yowthe, and on my jolitee,
It tikleth° me about min herte rote.°
Unto this day it dooth min herte bote°
That I have had my world as in my time.
But age, allas! that al wole envenime,°
Hath me biraft° my beautee and my pith;°
Lat go, farwel, the devel go therwith!
The flour is goon, ther is namore to telle,
The bren,° as I best can, now moste I selle;
But yet to be right mirie wol I fonde.°
Now wol I tellen of my fourth housbonde.

¶“I seye, I hadde in herte greet despit°
That he of any other had delit.
But he was quit,° by God and by Seint Joce!
I made him of the same wode a croce;°
Nat of my body in no foul manere,
But certeinly, I made folk swich chere,°
That in his owne grece° I made him frie
For angre, and for verray jalousie.
By God, in erthe I was his purgatorie,
For which I hope° his soule be in glorie.
For God it woot,° he sat ful ofte and song
Whan that his shoo° ful bitterly him wrong.°
Ther was no wight,° save God and he, that wiste,°
In many wise, how sore° I him twiste.°
He deid whan I cam fro Jerusalem,
And lith ygrave° under the rode-beem,°
Al° is his tombe noght so curious°
As was the sepulcre of him, Darius,
Which that Appelles wroghte subtilly;
It nis but° wast° to burie him preciously.°
Lat him far wel, God yeve his soule reste,
He is now in the grave and in his cheste.°

¶“Now of my fifthe housbond wol I telle.
God lete° his soule never come in helle!
And yet was he to me the moste shrewe;°
That feele I on my ribbes al by rewe,°
And ever shal, unto min ending-day.
But in our bed he was so fresh and gay,
And therwithal so wel coude he me glose,°
Whan that he wolde han my bele chose,°
That thogh° he had me bet° on every boon,°
He coude winne again my love anoon.
I trowe° I loved him beste, for that° he
Was of his love daungerous° to me.
We wommen han, if that I shal nat lie,
In this matere a queinte° fantasie;
Wait° what thing we may nat lightly have,
Therafter wol we crie al day and crave.
Forbede us thing, and that desiren we;
Prees on us faste,° and thanne wol we flee.
With daunger° oute we al our chaffare;°
Greet prees° at market maketh dere ware,°
And to greet cheep° is holde° at litel pris;°
This knoweth every womman that is wis.

¶“My fifthe housbond, God his soule blesse!
Which that I took for love and no richesse,
He somtime° was a clerk of Oxenford,
And had left scole, and wente at hoom to bord°
With my gossib,° dwellinge in our toun,
God have hir soule! hir name was Alisoun.
She knew min herte and eek my privetee°
Bet than our parish preest, so moot I thee!°
To hir biwreyed° I my conseil° al.
For had min housbond pissed on a wal,
Or doon a thing that sholde han cost his lif,
To hir, and to another worthy wif,°
And to my nece, which that I loved wel,
I wolde han told his conseil every del.
And so I did ful often, God it woot,°
That made his face ful often reed and hoot
For verray shame, and blamed himself for he
Had told to me so greet a privetee.

¶“And so bifel that ones, in a Lente,
(So often times I to my gossib wente,
For ever yet I loved to be gay,°
And for to walke, in March, Averille, and May,
Fro hous to hous, to here sondry talis),°
That Jankin clerk, and my gossib, dame Alis,
And I myself, into the feldes wente.
Min housbond was at London al that Lente;
I had the bettre leiser for to pleye,
And for to see, and eek for to be seye°
Of lusty° folk; what wiste° I wher my grace°
Was shapen° for to be, or in what place?
Therfore I maad my visitaciouns,
To vigilies° and to processiouns,
To preching° eek and to thise pilgrimages,
To pleys of miracles° and mariages,
And wered upon my gaye scarlet gites.°
Thise wormes, ne thise motthes, ne thise mites,
Upon my peril, frete° hem never a deel;°
And wostow° why? for they were used weel.°

¶“Now wol I tellen forth what happed me.
I sey, that in the feeldes walked we,
Til trewely we had swich daliance,°
This clerk and I, that of my purveiance°
I spak to him, and seide him, how that he,
If I were widwe, sholde wedde me.
For certeinly, I sey for no bobance,°
Yet was I never withouten purveiance
Of mariage, n’of° other thinges eek.
I holde a mouses hert° nat worth a leek,
That hath but oon hole for to sterte° to,
And if that faille, thanne is al ydo.°

¶“I bar him on honde° he hadde enchanted me;
My dame° taughte me that soutiltee.°
And eek° I seide, I mette° of him al night;
He wolde han slain me as I lay upright,°
And al my bed was ful of verray blood,
But yet I hope that ye shal do me good;
For blood bitokeneth gold, as me was taught.
And al was fals, I dremed of it right naught,
But as I folwed ay my dames lore,
As wel of this as other thinges more.

¶“But now sir, lat me see, what I shal seyn?
A! ha! by God, I have my tale° agein.

¶“Whan that my fourthe housbond was on bere,°
I weep algate,° and made sory chere,°
As wives moten,° for it is usage,°
And with my coverchief° covered my visage;
But for that° I was purveied of a make,°
I wept but smal, and that I undertake.°
To chirche was min housbond born° amorwe°
With neighebors, that for him maden sorwe;°
And Jankin oure clerk was oon of tho.°
As help me God, whan that I saugh him go
After the beer,° me thoughte he hadde a paire
Of legges and of feet so clene° and faire,
That al min herte I yaf unto his hold.°
He was, I trowe,° a twenty winter old,
And I was fourty, if I shal sey sooth;
But yet I hadde alwey a coltes tooth.°
Gat-tothed° I was, and that bicam° me weel;
I had the prente° of Seinte Venus seel.°
As help me God, I was a lusty oon,
And faire and riche, and yong, and wel bigoon;°
And trewly, as min housbonds tolde me,
I had the beste quoniam° might be.
For certes, I am al Venerien
In felinge, and min herte is Marcien.
Venus me yaf° my lust, my likerousnesse,°
And Mars yaf me my sturdy hardinesse.°
Min ascendent° was Taur,° and Mars therinne.
Allas! allas! that ever love was sinne!
I folwed ay min inclinacioun
By vertu° of my constellacioun;
That made me I coude noght withdrawe
My chambre of Venus from a good felawe.
Yet have I Martes mark° upon my face,
And also in another privee place.
For, God so wis° be my savacioun,
I loved never by no discrecioun,°
But ever folewed min appetit,
Al were° he short or long, or blak or whit;
I took no kep,° so that he liked me,°
How pore he was, ne eek of what degree.°

¶“What sholde I seye, but, at the monthes ende,
This joly clerk Jankin, that was so hende,°
Hath wedded me with greet solempnitee,
And to him yaf° I al the lond and fee°
That ever was me yeven° therbifore;
But afterward repented me ful sore.
He nolde suffre nothing of my list.°
By God, he smoot° me ones on the list,°
For that° I rente° out of his book a leef,°
That of the strook° min ere wex° al deef.
Stiborn° I was as is a leonesse,
And of my tonge a verray jangleresse,°
And walke I wolde, as I had doon biforn,
From hous to hous, although he had it sworn.°
For which he often times wolde preche,
And me of olde Roman gestes° teche,
How he, Simplicius Gallus, lefte his wif,
And hir forsook for terme of al his lif,
Noght but for open-heeded° he hir say°
Lokinge out at his dore upon a day.

¶“Another Romain tolde he me by name,
That, for° his wif was at a somers game
Withoute his witing,° he forsook° hir eke.
And than wolde he upon his Bible seke
That ilke° proverbe of Ecclesiaste,
Where he comandeth and forbedeth faste,°
Man shal nat suffre his wif go roule° aboute;
Than wolde he sey right thus, withouten doute,
‘Whoso that buildeth his hous al of salwes,°
And priketh° his blind hors over the falwes,°
And suffreth his wife to go seken halwes,°
Is worthy to been hanged on the galwes!’°
But al for noght, I sette noght an hawe°
Of his proverbes n’of his olde sawe,°
Ne I wold nat of him corrected be.
I hate him that my vices telleth me,
And so do mo,° God woot!° of us than I.
This made him with me wood al outrely;°
I nolde noght forbere° him in no cas.

¶“Now wol I sey yow sooth, by Seint Thomas,
Why that I rente° out of his book a leef,
For which he smoot me so that I was deef.

¶“He hadde a book that gladly, night and day,
For his desport° he wolde rede alway.
He cleped° it Valerie and Theofraste,
At whiche book he lough° alwey ful faste.°
And eek° ther was somtime a clerk at Rome,
A cardinal, that highte° Seint Jerome,
That made a book again Jovinian;
In whiche book eek ther was Tertulan,°
Crisippus, Trotula, and Helowis,°
That was abbesse nat fer fro Paris;
And eek the Parables of Salomon,
Ovides Art,° and bookes many on,
And alle thise wer bounde in o volume.°
And every night and day was his custume,
Whan he had leiser° and vacacioun
From other worldly occupacioun,
To reden on this book of wikked wives.
He knew of hem mo legendes and lives
Than been of goode wives in the Bible.
For trusteth wel, it is an impossible
That any clerk° wol speke good of wives,
But if° it be of holy seintes lives,
Ne of noon other womman never the mo.
Who peinted the leon,° tel me who?
By God, if wommen hadde writen stories,
As clerkes han withinne hir oratories,°
They wolde han write of men more wikkednesse
Than all the mark of Adam° may redresse.
The children of Mercurie and Venus
Been in hir wirking° ful contrarious;
Mercurie loveth wisdom and science,°
And Venus loveth riot and dispence.°
And, for° hir divers° disposicioun,
Ech falleth° in others exaltacioun;°
And thus, God woot!° Mercurie is desolat°
In Pisces, wher Venus is exaltat;°
And Venus falleth ther Mercurie is reised;
Therfor no womman of no clerk is preised.
The clerk, whan he is old, and may noght do
Of Venus werkes worth his olde sho,°
Than sit he doun, and writ in his dotage
That wommen can nat kepe hir mariage!°

¶“But now to purpos, why I tolde thee
That I was beten° for a book, pardee.
Upon a night Jankin, that was our sire,°
Redde on his book, as he sat by the fire,
Of Eva first, that, for° hir wikkednesse,
Was al mankinde broght to wrecchednesse,
For which that Jesu Crist himself was slain,
That boghte us with his herte blood again.
Lo, here expres° of womman may ye finde,
That womman was the los of al mankinde.

¶“Tho redde he me how Sampson loste his heres,°
Slepinge, his lemman° kitte hem with hir sheres;°
Thurgh whiche tresoun loste he bothe his eyen.°

¶“Tho° redde he me, if that I shal nat lyen,
Of Hercules and of his Dianire,
That caused him to sette himself afire.

¶“Nothing forgat° he the penaunce° and wo
That Socrates had with his wives two;
How Xantippa cast pisse upon his heed;
This sely° man sat stille as he were deed;
He wiped his heed, namore dorste° he seyn
But ‘Er that thonder° stinte,° comth a rein.’
Of Phasipha, that was the quene of Crete,
For shrewednesse,° him thought the tale swete;
Fy! spek namore—it is a grisly thing—
Of hir horrible lust and hir liking.°
Of Clitermistra, for hir lecherie,
That falsly made hir housbond for to die,
He redde it with ful good devocioun.°

¶“He told me eek for what occasioun
Amphiorax at Thebes loste his lif;
Min housbonde hadde a legende of his wif,
Eriphilem, that for an ouche° of gold
Hath prively unto the Grekes told
Wher that hir housbonde hidde him in a place,
For which he hadde at Thebes sory grace.°

¶“Of Livia tolde he me, and of Lucie,
They bothe made hir housbonds for to die;
That oon for love, that other was for hate;
Livia hir housbonde, on an even late,
Empoisoned hath, for that she was his fo.
Lucia, likerous, loved hir housbond so,
That, for° he sholde alwey upon hir thinke,
She yaf° him swich a maner love-drinke,
That he was deed, er it wer by° the morwe;
And thus algates° housbonds hadden sorwe.

¶“Than tolde he me, how oon Latumius
Compleined to his felawe Arrius,
That in his gardin growed swich a tree,
On which, he seid, how that his wives three
Hanged hemself for° herte despitous.°
‘O leve brother,’ quod this Arrius,
‘Yif me a plante of thilke blissed tree,
And in my gardin planted shal it be!’

¶“Of latter date, of wives hath he red,
That somme han slain hir housbonds in hir bed,
And lete hir lechour dighte° hir al the night
Whan that the corps lay in the floor upright.°
And somme han drive nailes in hir brain
Whil that they slepte, and thus they han hem slain.
Somme han hem yeven° poisoun in hir drinke.
He spak mor harm than herte may bithinke.
And therwithal, he knew of mo proverbes
Than in this world ther growen gras or herbes.
‘Bet is,’ quod he, ‘thin habitacioun
Be with a leoun or a foul dragoun,
Than with a womman using° for to chide.
Bet is,’ quod he, ‘hie° in the roof abide
Than with an angry wif doun in the hous;
They been so wikked and contrarious;
They haten that° hir housbonds loveth ay.’°
He seide, ‘a womman cast hir shame away,
Whan she cast of° hir smok’;° and forther mo,
‘A fair womman, but she be chaast also,
Is lik a gold ring in a sowes nose.’
Who wolde wenen,° or who wold suppose°
The wo that in min herte was, and pine?°

¶“And whan I saugh he wolde never fine°
To reden on this cursed book al night,
Al sodeinly three leves° have I plight°
Out of his book, right as° he radde, and eke,
I with my fist so took him° on the cheke,
That in our fir° he fil bakward adoun.
And he upstirte as dooth a wood° leoun,
And with his fest° he smoot me on the heed,
That in the floor I lay as I wer deed.
And when he saugh how stille that I lay,
He was agast,° and wolde han fled his way,
Til atte laste out of my swogh° I breide:°
‘O! hastow slain me, false theef?’° I seide,
‘And for my land thus hastow mordred me?
Er° I be deed, yet wol I kisse thee.’

¶“And neer he cam, and kneled faire adoun,
And seide, ‘deere suster Alisoun,
As help me God, I shal thee never smite;°
That I have doon, it is thyself to wite.°
Foryeve it me, and that I thee biseke’°—
And yet eftsones° I hitte him on the cheke,
And seide, ‘Theef,° thus muchel am I wreke;°
Now wol I die, I may no lenger speke.’
But atte laste, with muchel° care and wo,
We fille acorded,° by us selven two.
He yaf° me al the bridel° in min hond
To han the governance of hous and lond,
And of his tonge and of his hond also,
And made him brenne° his book anon right tho.°
And whan that I had geten unto me,
By maistrie,° al the soverainetee,°
And that he seid, ‘Min owne trewe° wif,
Do as thee lust° the terme of al thy lif,
Keep thin honour, and keepe eek min estaat’°—
After that day we had never debaat.
God help me so, I was to him as kinde
As any wif from Denmark unto Inde,
And also trewe,° and so was he to me.
I prey to God that sit in magestee,
So blesse his soule, for his mercy dere!
Now wol I sey my tale, if ye wol here.”

¶ The Frere lough,° whan he had herd al this,
“Now, dame,” quod he, “so have I joye or blis,
This is a long preamble of a tale!”
And whan the Somnour herd the Frere gale,°
“Lo!” quod the Somnour, “Goddes armes two!
A frer wol entremette him° ever mo.
Lo, goode men, a flie° and eek a frere
Wol falle in every dish and eek matere.°
What spekestow of preambulacioun?°
What! amble,° or trotte, or pees,° or go sit doun;
Thou lettest° our disport° in this manere.”

¶“Ye, woltow so,° sir Somnour?” quod the Frere,
“Now, by my feith, I shal, er that I go,
Telle of a Somnour swich° a tale or two,
That al the folk shal laughen in this place.”

¶“Now elles,° Frere, I wol bischrew thy face,”°
Quod this Somnour, “and I bishrewe me,°
But if° I telle tales two or thre
Of freres er I com to Sidingborne,
That I shal make thin herte for to morne;°
For wel I woot° thy patience is goon.”

¶Our Hoste cride “Pees! and that anoon!”°
And seide, “Lat the womman telle hir tale.
Ye fare° as folk that dronken ben of ale.
Do, dame, tel forth your tale, and that is best.”

¶“Al redy, sir,” quod she, “right as yow lest,°
If I have licence of this worthy Frere.”
“Yis, dame,” quod he, “tel forth, and I wol here.”
