The double sorwe of Troilus to tellen,
That was the king Priamus sone of Troye,
In lovinge, how his aventures fellen
Fro wo to wele, and after out of joye,
My purpos is, er that I part fro ye.
Thesiphone, thou help me for t’endite
Thise woful vers, that wepen as I write!
To thee clepe I, thou goddesse of torment,
Thou cruel Furie, sorwing ever in peine;
Help me, that am the sorwful instrument
That helpeth lovers, as I can, to pleine!
For wel sit it, the sothe for to seyne,
A woful wight to han a drery fere,
And, to a sorwful tale, a sory chere.
For I, that god of Loves servaunts serve,
Ne dar to Love, for min unliklinesse,
Preyen for speed, al sholde I therfor sterve,
So fer am I fro his help in derknesse;
But nathelees, if this may doon gladnesse
To any lover, and his cause availe,
Have he my thank, and min be this travaile!
But ye loveres, that bathen in gladnesse,
If any drope of pitee in yow be,
Remembreth yow on passed hevinesse
That ye han felt, and on the adversitee
Of othere folk, and thenketh how that ye
Han felt that Love dorste yow displese;
Or ye han wonne him with to greet an ese.
And preyeth for hem that ben in the cas
Of Troilus, as ye may after here,
That love hem bringe in heven to solas,
And eek for me preyeth to God so dere,
That I have might to shewe, in som manere,
Swich peine and wo as Loves folk endure,
In Troilus unsely aventure.
And biddeth eek for hem that been despeired
In love, that never nil recovered be,
And eek for hem that falsly been apeired
Thorugh wikked tonges, be it he or she;
Thus biddeth God, for his benignitee,
To graunte hem sone out of this world to pace,
That been despeired out of Loves grace.
And biddeth eek for hem that been at ese,
That God hem graunte ay good perseveraunce,
And sende hem might hir ladies so to plese,
That it to Love be worship and plesaunce.
For so hope I my soule best avaunce,
To prey for hem that Loves servaunts be,
And write hir wo, and live in charitee.
And for to have of hem compassioun
As though I were hir owne brother dere.
Now herkneth with a good entencioun,
For now wol I gon streight to my matere,
In which ye may the double sorwes here
Of Troilus, in loving of Criseyde,
And how that she forsook him er she deide.
It is wel wist, how that the Grekes stronge
In armes with a thousand shippes wente
To Troyewardes, and the citee longe
Assegeden neigh ten yeer er they stente,
And, in diverse wise and oon entente,
The ravisshing to wreken of Eleine,
By Paris doon, they wroughten al hir peine.
Now fil it so, that in the toun ther was
Dwellinge a lord of greet auctoritee,
A gret devin that cleped was Calkas,
That in science so expert was, that he
Knew wel that Troye shold destroyed be,
By answere of his god, that highte thus,
Daun Phebus or Apollo Delphicus.
So whan this Calkas knew by calculinge,
And eek by answere of this Appollo,
That Grekes sholden swich a peple bringe,
Thorugh which that Troye moste been fordo
He caste anoon out of the toun to go;
For wel wiste he, by sort, that Troye sholde
Destroyed been, ye, wolde who-so nolde.
For which, for to departen softely
Took purpos ful in this forknowing wise,
And to the Grekes ost ful prively
He stal anoon; and they, in curteis wise,
Him deden bothe worship and servise,
In trust that he hath conning hem to rede
In every peril which that is to drede.
The noise up roos, whan it was first aspied,
Thorugh al the toun, and openly was spoken,
That Calkas traitor fled was, and allied
With hem of Grece; and casten to ben wroken
On him that falsly hadde his feith so broken;
And seiden, he and al his kin at ones
Ben worthy for to brennen, fel and bones.
Now hadde Calkas left, in this meschaunce,
Al unwist of this false and wikked dede,
His doughter, which that was in gret penaunce,
For of hir lif she was ful sore in drede,
As she that niste what was best to rede;
For bothe a widowe was she, and allone
Of any freend, to whom she dorste hir mone.
Criseyde was this lady name aright
As to my dome, in alle Troyes citee
Nas noon so fair, forpassing every wight
So aungellik was hir natif beautee,
That lik a thing inmortal semed she,
As doth an hevenish parfit creature,
That doun were sent in scorning of nature.
This lady, which that alday herde at ere
Hir fadres shame, his falsnesse and tresoun,
Wel nigh out of hir wit for sorwe and fere,
In widewes habit large of samit broun,
On knees she fil biforn Ector adoun;
With pitous vois, and tendrely wepinge,
His mercy bad, hirselven excusinge.
Now was this Ector pitous of nature,
And saw that she was sorwfully bigoon,
And that she was so fair a creature;
Of his goodnesse he gladed hir anoon,
And seide, “Lat your fadres treson goon
Forth with mischaunce, and ye yourself, in joye,
Dwelleth with us, whil you good list, in Troye.
“And al th’onour that men may doon yow have,
As ferforth as your fader dwelled here,
Ye shul han, and your body shal men save,
As fer as I may ought enquere or here.”
And she him thonked with ful humble chere,
And ofter wolde, and it had ben his wille,
And took hir leve, and hoom, and held hir stille.
And in hir hous she abood with swich meinee
As to hir honour nede was to holde;
And whil she was dwellinge in that citee,
Kepte hir estat, and bothe of yonge and olde
Ful wel beloved, and wel men of hir tolde.
But whether that she children hadde or noon,
I rede it nought; therfore I lete it goon.
The thinges fellen, as they doon of werre,
Bitwixen hem of Troye and Grekes ofte;
For som day boughten they of Troye it derre,
And eft the Grekes founden no thing softe
The folk of Troye; and thus fortune onlofte,
And under eft, gan hem to wheelen bothe
After hir cours, ay whil that they were wrothe.
But how this toun com to destruccioun
Ne falleth nought to purpos me to telle;
For it were here a long disgressioun
Fro my matere, and yow to long to dwelle.
But the Troyane gestes, as they felle,
In Omer, or in Dares, or in Dite,
Whoso that can, may rede hem as they write.
But though that Grekes hem of Troye shetten,
And hir citee bisegede al aboute,
Hir olde usage wolde they not letten,
As for to honoure hir goddes ful devoute;
But aldermost in honour, out of doute,
They hadde a relik hight Palladion,
That was hir trist aboven everichon.
And so bifel, whan comen was the time
Of Aperil, whan clothed is the mede
With newe grene, of lusty Ver the prime,
And swote smellen floures white and rede,
In sondry wises shewed, as I rede,
The folk of Troye hir observaunces olde,
Palladions feste for to holde.
And to the temple, in al hir beste wise,
In general, ther wente many a wight,
To herknen of Palladion the servise;
And namely, so many a lusty knight,
So many a lady fresh and maiden bright,
Ful wel arayed, bothe moste and leste,
Ye, bothe for the seson and the feste.
Among thise othere folk was Criseyda,
In widewes habite blak; but nathelees,
Right as our firste lettre is now an A,
In beautee first so stood she, makelees;
Hir godly looking gladede al the prees.
Nas never seyn thing to ben preised derre,
Nor under cloude blak so bright a sterre
As was Criseyde, as folk seide everichoon
That hir bihelden in hir blake wede;
And yet she stood ful lowe and stille alloon,
Bihinden othere folk, in litel brede,
And neigh the dore, ay under shames drede,
Simple of atir, and debonaire of chere,
With ful assured loking and manere.
This Troilus, as he was wont to gide
His yonge knightes, ladde hem up and doun
In thilke large temple on every side,
Biholding ay the ladies of the toun,
Now here, now there, for no devocioun
Hadde he to noon, to reven him his reste,
But gan to preise and lakken whom him leste.
And in his walk ful fast he gan to waiten
If knight or squier of his companie
Gan for to sike, or lete his eyen baiten
On any woman that he coude aspie,
He wolde smile, and holden it folie,
And seye him thus, “God wot, she slepeth softe
For love of thee, whan thou tornest ful ofte!
“I have herd told, pardieux, of your livinge,
Ye lovers, and your lewede observaunces,
And which a labour folk han in winninge
Of love, and, in the keping, which doutaunces;
And whan your preye is lost, wo and penaunces.
O verrey foles! nice and blinde be ye;
Ther nis not oon can war by other be.”
And with that word he gan cast up the browe,
Ascaunces, “Lo! is this nought wisly spoken?”
At which the god of love gan loken rowe
Right for despit, and shoop for to ben wroken;
He kidde anoon his bowe nas not broken;
For sodeinly he hit him at the fulle;
And yet as proud a pekok can he pulle.
O blinde world, O blinde entencioun!
How ofte falleth al th’effect contraire
Of surquidrie and foul presumpcioun;
For caught is proud, and caught is debonaire.
This Troilus is clomben on the staire,
And litel weneth that he moot descenden.
But al day falleth thing that foles ne wenden.
As proude Bayard ginneth for to skippe
Out of the wey, so priketh him his corn,
Til he a lash have of the longe whippe,
Than thenketh he, “Though I praunce al biforn
First in the trais, ful fat and newe shorn,
Yet am I but an hors, and horses lawe
I moot endure, and with my feres drawe.”
So ferde it by this fers and proude knight;
Though he a worthy kinges sone were,
And wende no thing had had swiche might
Ayens his wil that sholde his herte stere,
Yet with a look his herte wex afere,
That he, that now was most in pride above,
Wex sodeinly most subget unto love.
Forthy ensample taketh of this man,
Ye wise, proude, and worthy folkes alle,
To scornen Love, which that so sone can
The freedom of youre hertes to him thralle;
For ever it was, and ever it shal bifalle,
That Love is he that alle thing may binde,
For may no man fordo the lawe of kinde.
That this be sooth, hath preved and doth yet;
For this trowe I ye knowen, alle or some,
Men reden not that folk han gretter wit
Than they that han be most with love ynome;
And strengest folk ben therwith overcome,
The worthiest and grettest of degree;
This was, and is, and yet men shal it see.
And trewelich it sit wel to be so,
For alderwisest han therwith ben plesed;
And they that han ben aldermost in wo,
With love han ben conforted most and esed;
And ofte it hath the cruel herte apesed,
And worthy folk maad worthier of name,
And causeth most to dreden vice and shame.
Now sith it may not goodly be withstonde,
And is a thing so vertuous in kinde,
Refuseth not to Love for to be bonde,
Sin, as himselven list, he may yow binde.
The yerde is bet that bowen wole and winde
Than that that brest; and therfor I yow rede
To folwen him that so wel can yow lede.
But for to tellen forth in special
As of this kinges sone of which I tolde,
And leten other thinges collateral,
Of him thenke I my tale forth to holde,
Bothe of his joye, and of his cares colde;
And al his werk, as touching this matere,
For I it gan, I wil therto refere.
Within the temple he wente him forth pleyinge,
This Troilus, of every wight aboute,
On this lady and now on that lokinge,
Wherso she were of toune, or withoute:
And upon cas bifel, that thorugh a route
His eye perced, and so depe it wente,
Til on Criseyde it smoot, and ther it stente.
And sodeinly he wex therwith astoned,
And gan hire bet biholde in thrifty wise:
“O mercy, God!” thoughte he, “Wher hastow woned,
That art so fair and goodly to devise?”
Therwith his herte gan to sprede and rise,
And softe sighed, lest men mighte him here,
And caughte ayein his firste pleying chere.
She nas not with the leste of hir stature,
But alle hir limes so wel answeringe
Weren to womanhod, that creature
Was neuer lasse mannish in seminge.
And eek the pure wise of her movinge
Shewede wel, that men might in hir gesse
Honour, estat, and wommanly noblesse.
To Troilus right wonder wel withalle
Gan for to like hir movinge and hir chere,
Which somdel deinous was, for she leet falle
Hir look a lite aside, in swich manere,
Ascaunces, “What! may I not stonden here?”
And after that hir loking gan she lighte,
That never thoughte him seen so good a sighte.
And of hir look in him ther gan to quiken
So greet desir, and swich affeccioun,
That in his hertes botme gan to stiken
Of hir his fixe and depe impressioun:
And though he erst had poured up and doun,
He was tho glad his hornes in to shrinke;
Unnethes wiste he how to loke or winke.
Lo, he that leet himselven so konninge,
And scorned hem that loves peines dryen,
Was ful unwar that love hadde his dwellinge
Withinne the subtile stremes of hir yän;
That sodeinly him thoughte he felte dyen,
Right with hir look, the spirit in his herte;
Blessed be love, that thus can folk converte!
She, this in blak, liking to Troilus
Over alle thing he stood for to biholde;
Ne his desir, ne wherfor he stood thus,
He neither chere made, ne worde tolde;
But from afer, his maner for to holde,
On other thing his look somtime he caste,
And ofte on hir, whil that servise laste.
And after this, not fulliche al awhaped,
Out of the temple al esiliche he wente,
Repentinge him that he hadde ever yjaped
Of loves folk, lest fully the descente
Of scorn fille on himself; but, what he mente,
Lest it were wist on any maner side,
His wo he gan dissimulen and hide.
Whan he was fro the temple thus departed,
He streight anoon unto his paleis torneth,
Right with hir look thurgh shoten and thurgh darted,
Al feineth he in lust that he sojorneth;
And al his chere and speche also he borneth;
And ay, of loves servants every while,
Himself to wrie, at hem he gan to smile.
And seide, “Lord, so ye live al in lest,
Ye loveres! for the conningest of yow,
That serveth most ententiflich and best,
Him tit as often harm therof as prow;
Your hire is quit ayein, ye, God wot how!
Nought wel for wel, but scorn for good servise;
In feith, your ordre is ruled in good wise!
“In nouncertein ben al your observaunces,
But it a sely fewe pointes be;
Ne nothing asketh so grete attendaunces
As doth your lay, and that knowe alle ye;
But that is not the worste, as mote I thee;
But, tolde I yow the worste point, I leve,
Al seide I sooth, ye wolden at me greve!
“But tak this, that ye loveres ofte eschuwe,
Or elles doon of good entencioun,
Ful oft thy lady wole it misconstrue,
And deme it harm in hir opinioun;
And yet if she, for other enchesoun,
Be wrooth, than shalt thou han a groin anoon:
Lord! wel is him that may be of yow oon!”
But for al this, whan that he say his time,
He held his pees, non other bote him gained;
For love bigan his fetheres so to lime,
That wel unnethe unto his folk he feined
That othere besie nedes him destrained;
For wo was him, that what to doon he niste,
But bad his folk to goon wher that hem liste.
And whan that he in chaumbre was allone,
He doun upon his beddes feet him sette,
And first he gan to sike, and eft to grone,
And thoughte ay on hir so, withouten lette,
That, as he sat and wook, his spirit mette
That he hir saw atemple, and al the wise
Right of hir loke, and gan it newe avise.
Thus gan he make a mirour of his minde,
In which he saugh al hoolly hir figure;
And that he wel coude in his herte finde,
It was to him a right good aventure
To love swich oon, and if he dide his cure
To serven hir, yet mighte he falle in grace,
Or elles, for oon of hir servaunts pace.
Imagining that travaille nor grame
Ne mighte, for so goodly oon, be lorn
As she, ne him for his desir ne shame,
Al were it wist, but in pris and upborn
Of alle lovers wel more than biforn;
Thus argumented he in his ginninge,
Ful unavised of his wo cominge.
Thus took he purpos loves craft to suwe,
And thoughte he wolde werken prively,
First, to hiden his desir in muwe
From every wight yborn, al outrely,
But he mighte ought recovered be therby;
Remembring him, that love to wide yblowe
Yelt bittre fruit, though swete seed be sowe.
And over al this, yet muchel more he thoughte
What for to speke, and what to holden inne,
And what to arten hir to love he soughte,
And on a song anoonright to biginne,
And gan loude on his sorwe for to winne;
For with good hope he gan fully assente
Criseyde for to love, and nought repente.
And of his song nought only the sentence,
As writ min autour called Lollius,
But pleinly, save our tonges difference,
I dar wel sayn, in al, that Troilus
Seide in his song; lo! every word right thus
As I shal seyn; and whoso list it here,
Lo! next this vers, he may it finden here.
“If no love is, O God, what fele I so?
And if love is, what thing and whiche is he?
If love be good, from whennes comth my wo?
If it be wikke, a wonder thinketh me,
Whenne every torment and adversitee
That cometh of him, may to me savory thinke;
For ay thurst I, the more that I it drinke.
“And if that at min owene lust I brenne,
Fro whennes cometh my wailing and my pleinte?
If harme agree me, wherto pleine I thenne?
I noot, ne why unwery that I feinte.
O quike deeth, O swete harm so queinte,
How may of thee in me swich quantitee,
But if that I consente that it be?
“And if that I consente, I wrongfully
Compleine, ywis; thus possed to and fro,
Al sterelees withinne a boot am I
Amid the see, bitwixen windes two,
That in contrarie stonden evermo.
Allas! what is this wonder maladie?
For hete of cold, for cold of hete, I deie.”
And to the god of love thus seide he
With pitous vois, “O lord, now youres is
My spirit, which that oughte youres be.
Yow thanke I, lord, that han me brought to this;
But whether goddesse or womman, ywis,
She be, I noot, which that ye do me serve;
But as hir man I wole ay live and sterve.
“Ye stonden in hire eyen mightily,
As in a place unto your vertu digne;
Wherfore, lord, if my servise or I
May like yow, so beth to me benigne;
For min estat royal here I resigne
Into hir hond, and with ful humble chere
Bicome hir man, as to my lady dere.”
In him ne deined sparen blood royal
The fir of love, wherfro God me blesse,
Ne him forbar in no degree, for al
His vertu or his excellent prowesse;
But held him as his thral lowe in distresse,
And brende him so in sondry wise ay newe,
That sixty time a day he loste his hewe.
So muche, day by day, his owene thought,
For lust to hir, gan quiken and encrese,
That every other charge he sette at nought;
Forthy ful ofte, his hote fir to cese,
To seen hir goodly look he gan to prese;
For therby to ben esed wel he wende,
And ay the ner he was, the more he brende.
For ay the ner the fir, the hotter is,
This, trowe I, knoweth al this companie.
But were he fer or neer, I dar seye this,
By night or day, for wisdom or folie,
His herte, which that is his brestes ye,
Was ay on hir, that fairer was to sene
Than ever was Eleine or Polixene.
Eek of the day ther passed nought an houre
That to himself a thousand time he seide,
“Good goodly, to whom serve I and laboure,
As I best can, now wolde God, Criseyde,
Ye wolden on me rewe er that I deide!
My dere herte, allas! min hele and hewe
And lif is lost, but ye wole on me rewe.”
Alle othere dredes weren from him fledde,
Bothe of the assege and his savacioun;
Ne in him desir noon othere fownes bredde
But arguments to this conclusioun,
That she on him wolde han compassioun,
And he to be hir man, whil he may dure;
Lo, here his lif, and from the deeth his cure!
The sharpe shoures felle of armes preve,
That Ector or his othere bretheren diden,
Ne made him only therfore ones meve;
And yet was he, wherso men wente or riden,
Founde oon the best, and lengest time abiden
Ther peril was, and dide eek such travaile
In armes, that to thenke it was mervaile.
But for non hate he to the Grekes hadde,
Ne also for the rescous of the toun,
Ne made him thus in armes for to madde,
But only, lo, for this conclusioun,
To liken hir the bet for his renoun;
Fro day to day in armes so he spedde,
That al the Grekes as the deeth him dredde.
And fro this forth tho refte him love his sleep,
And made his mete his foo; and eek his sorwe
Gan multiplie, that, whoso toke keep,
It shewed in his hewe, bothe eve and morwe;
Therfor a title he gan him for to borwe
Of other siknesse, lest of him men wende
That the hote fir of love him brende.
And seide, he hadde a fever and ferde amis;
But how it was, certain, can I not seye,
If that his lady understood not this,
Or feined hir she niste, oon of the tweie;
But wel I rede that, by no maner weie,
Ne semed it as that she of him roughte,
Nor of his peine, or whatsoever he thoughte.
But than fel to this Troilus such wo,
That he was wel neigh wood; for ay his drede
Was this, that she som wight had loved so,
That never of him she wolde have taken hede;
For which him thoughte he felte his herte blede.
Ne of his wo ne dorste he not biginne
To tellen it, for al this world to winne.
But whanne he hadde a space fro his care,
Thus to himself ful ofte he gan to pleine;
He saide, “O fool, now art thou in the snare,
That whilom japedest at loves peine;
Now artow hent, now gnaw thin owene cheine;
Thou were ay wont eche lovere reprehende
Of thing fro which thou canst thee nat defende.
“What wol now every lover seyn of thee,
If this be wist, but ever in thin absence
Laughen in scorn, and seyn, ‘Lo, ther gooth he,
That is the man of so gret sapience,
That held us loveres leest in reverence!
Now, thonked be God, he may goon in the daunce
Of hem that Love list febly for to avaunce!’
“But, O thou woful Troilus, God wolde,
Sin thow most loven thurgh thy destinee,
That thow beset were on swich oon that sholde
Knowe al thy wo, al lakkede hir pitee:
But al so cold in love, towardes thee,
Thy lady is, as frost in winter mone,
And thou fordoon, as snow in fir is sone.
“God wolde I were arived in the port
Of deeth, to which my sorwe wil me lede!
A, Lord, to me it were a greet comfort;
Then were I quit of languisshing in drede.
For be min hidde sorwe yblowe on brede
I shal bijaped been a thousand time
More than that fool of whos folie men rime.
“But now help God, and ye, swete, for whom
I pleine, ycaught, ye, never wight so faste!
O mercy, dere herte, and help me from
The deeth, for I, whil that my lif may laste,
More than myself wol love yow to my laste.
And with som freendly look gladeth me, swete,
Though never more thing ye me bihete!”
This wordes and ful manie another to
He spak, and called evere in his compleinte
Hir name, for to tellen hir his wo,
Til neigh that he in salte teres dreinte.
Al was for nought, she herde nought his pleinte;
And whan that he bithoughte on that folie,
A thousand fold his wo gan multiplie.
Biwailing in his chambre thus allone,
A freend of his, that called was Pandare,
Com ones in unwar, and herde him grone,
And sey his freend in swich distresse and care:
“Allas!” quod he, “who causeth al this fare?
O mercy, God! what unhap may this mene?
Han now thus sone Grekes maad yow lene?
“Or hastow som remors of conscience,
And art now falle in som devocioun,
And wailest for thy sinne and thin offence,
And hast for ferde caught attricioun?
God save hem that biseged han our toun,
And so can leie our jolite on presse,
And bring our lusty folk to holinesse!”
These wordes seide he for the nones alle,
That with swich thing he mighte him angry maken,
And with an angre don his sorwe falle,
As for the time, and his corage awaken;
But wel he wiste, as fer as tonges spaken,
Ther nas a man of gretter hardinesse
Than he, ne more desired worthinesse.
“What cas,” quod Troilus, “or what aventure
Hath gided thee to see my languisshinge,
That am refus of euery creature?
But for the love of God, at my preyinge,
Go henne away, for certes, my deyinge
Wol thee disese, and I mot nedes deie;
Therfor go wey, ther is no more to seye.
“But if thou wene I be thus sik for drede,
It is not so, and therfor scorne nought;
Ther is another thing I take of hede
Wel more than ought the Grekes han ywrought,
Which cause is of my deeth, for sorwe and thought.
But though that I now tell thee it ne leste,
Be thou nought wrooth, I hide it for the beste.”
This Pandare, that neigh malt for wo and routhe,
Ful often seide, “Allas! what may this be?
Now freend,” quod he, “if ever love or trouthe
Hath been, or is, bitwixen thee and me,
Ne do thou never swiche a crueltee
To hide fro thy freend so greet a care;
Wostow nought wel that it am I, Pandare?
“I wole parten with thee al thy peine,
If it be so I do thee no comfort,
As it is freendes right, sooth for to seyne,
To entreparten wo, as glad desport.
I have, and shal, for trewe or fals report,
In wrong and right yloved thee al my live;
Hid not thy wo fro me, but telle it blive.”
Than gan this sorwful Troilus to sike,
And seide him thus, “God leve it be my beste
To telle it thee; for, sith it may thee like,
Yet wole I telle it, though min herte breste;
And wel wot I thou mayst do me no reste.
But lest thow deme I truste not to thee,
Now herkne, freend, for thus it stant with me.
“Love, ayeins the which whoso defendeth
Himselven most, him alderlest availeth,
With desespeir so sorwfully me offendeth,
That streight unto the deeth min herte saileth.
Therto desir so brenningly me assailleth,
That to ben slain it were a gretter joye
To me than king of Grece been and Troye!
“Suffiseth this, my fulle freend Pandare,
That I have seid, for now wostow my wo;
And for the love of God, my colde care
So hid it wel, I telle it nevere to mo;
For harmes mighte folwen, mo than two,
If it were wist; but be thou in gladnesse,
And lat me sterve, unknowe, of my distresse.”
“How hastow thus unkindely and longe
Hid this fro me, thou fool?” quod Pandarus;
“Paraunter thou might after swich oon longe,
That min avis anoon may helpen us.”
“This were a wonder thing,” quod Troilus,
“Thou coudest nevere in love thyselven wisse;
How devel maystow bringen me to blisse?”
“Ye, Troilus, now herke,” quod Pandare,
“Though I be nice; it happeth ofte so,
That oon that exces doth ful ivele fare,
By good counseil can kepe his freend therfro.
I have myself eek seyn a blind man go
Theras he fel that coude loke wide;
A fool may eek a wis man ofte gide.
“A whetston is no kerving instrument,
And yet it maketh sharpe kerving tolis.
And ther thow woost that I have ought miswent,
Eschew thou that, for swich thing to thee scole is;
Thus often wise men ben war by folis.
If thou do so, thy wit is wel biwared;
By his contrarie is every thing declared.
“For how might ever sweetnesse have be knowe
To him that never tasted bitternesse?
Ne no man may ben inly glad, I trowe,
That never was in sorwe or som distresse;
Eek whit by blak, by shame eek worthinesse,
Ech set by other, more for other semeth;
As men may see; and so the wise it demeth.
“Sith thus of two contraries is a lore,
I, that have in love so ofte assaied
Grevaunces, oughte conne, and wel the more
Counsaillen thee of that thou art amaied.
Eek thee ne oughte nat ben ivel apaied,
Though I desire with thee for to bere
Thin hevy charge; it shal the lasse dere.
“I woot wel that it fareth thus by me
As to thy brother Paris an herdesse,
Which that ycleped was Oenone,
Wrot in a compleint of hir hevinesse:
Ye say the lettre that she wroot, I gesse?”
“Nay, nevere yet, ywis,” quod Troilus.
“Now,” quod Pandare, “herkne; it was thus.—
“ ‘Phebus, that first fond art of medicine,’
Quod she, ‘and coude in every wightes care
Remede and reed, by herbes he knew fine,
Yet to himself his conning was ful bare;
For love hadde him so bounden in a snare,
Al for the doughter of the kinge Admete,
That al his craft ne coude his sorwe bete.’—
“Right so fare I, unhappily for me;
I love oon best, and that me smerteth sore;
And yet, paraunter, can I rede thee,
And not myself; repreve me no more.
I have no cause, I woot wel, for to sore
As doth an hauk that listeth for to pleie
But to thin help yet somwhat can I seye.
“And of o thing right siker maystow be,
That certain, for to deyen in the peine,
That I shal never mo discoveren thee;
Ne, by my trouthe, I kepe nat restreine
Thee fro thy love, thogh that it were Eleine,
That is thy brotheres wif, if ich it wiste;
Be what she be, and love hir as thee liste.
“Therfore, as freend fullich in me assure,
And tel me plat what is thin enchesoun,
And final cause of wo that ye endure;
For douteth nothing, min entencioun
Nis nought to yow of reprehencioun,
To speke as now, for no wight may bireve
A man to love, til that him list to leve.
“And witeth wel, that bothe two ben vices,
Mistrusten alle, or elles alle leve;
But wel I woot, the mene of it no vice is,
For for to trusten sum wight is a preve
Of trouthe, and forthi wolde I fain remeve
Thy wrong conceite, and do thee som wight triste,
Thy wo to telle; and tel me, if thee liste.
“The wise seith, ‘wo him that is allone,
For, and he falle, he hath noon help to rise’;
And sith thou hast a felawe, tel thy mone;
For this nis not, certein, the nexte wise
To winnen love, as techen us the wise,
To walwe and wepe as Niobe the quene,
Whos teres yet in marbel been ysene.
“Lat be thy weping and thy drerinesse,
And lat us lissen wo with other speche;
So may thy woful time seme lesse.
Delite not in wo thy wo to seche,
As doon thise foles that hir sorwes eche
With sorwe, whan they han misaventure,
And listen nought to seche hem other cure.
“Men seyn, ‘To wrecche is consolacioun
To have another felawe in his peine’;
That oughte wel ben oure opinioun,
For, bothe thou and I, of love we pleine;
So ful of sorwe am I, soth for to seyne,
That certeinly no more harde grace
May sitte on me, forwhy ther is no space.
“If God wol thou art not agast of me,
Lest I wolde of thy lady thee bigile,
Thow wost thyself whom that I love, pardee,
As I best can, gon sithen longe while.
And sith thou wost I do it for no gile,
And sith I am he that thou tristest most,
Tel me sumwhat, sin al my wo thou wost.”
Yet Troilus, for al this, no word seide,
But longe he lay as stille as he ded were;
And after this with sikinge he abreide,
And to Pandarus vois he lente his ere,
And up his eyen caste he, that in fere
Was Pandarus, lest that in frenesie
He sholde falle, or elles sone die:
And cride “Awake” ful wonderly and sharpe;
“What? slombrestow as in a litargie?
Or artow lik an asse to the harpe,
That hereth soun, whan men the strenges plie,
But in his minde of that no melodie
May sinken, him to glade, for that he
So dul is of his bestialitee?”
And with that Pandare of his wordes stente;
But Troilus yet him no word answerde,
Forwhy to telle nas not his entente
To never no man, for whom that he so ferde.
For it is seid, “Man maketh ofte a yerde
With which the maker is himself ybeten
In sondry maner,” as thise wise treten,
And namely, in his counseil tellinge
That toucheth love that oughte be secree;
For of himself it wolde ynough outspringe,
But if that it the bet governed be.
Eek somtime it is craft to seme flee
Fro thing which in effect men hunte faste;
Al this gan Troilus in his herte caste.
But nathelees, whan he had herd him crie
“Awake!” he gan to sike wonder sore,
And seide, “Freend, though that I stille lie,
I am not deef; now pees, and cry no more;
For I have herd thy wordes and thy lore;
But suffre me my mischef to biwaile,
For thy proverbes may me nought availe.
“Nor other cure canstow noon for me.
Eek I nil not be cured, I wol deie;
What knowe I of the quene Niobe?
Lat be thine olde ensaumples, I thee preye.”
“No,” quod tho Pandarus, “therfore I seye,
Swich is delit of foles to biwepe
Hir wo, but seken bote they ne kepe.
“Now knowe I that ther reson in thee faileth.
But tel me, if I wiste what she were
For whom that thee al this misaunter aileth
Dorstestow that I tolde hir in hir ere
Thy wo, sith thou darst not thyself for fere,
And hir bisoughte on thee to han som routhe?”
“Why, nay,” quod he, “by God and by my trouthe!”
“What? not as bisily,” quod Pandarus,
“As though myn owene lif lay on this nede?”
“No, certes, brother,” quod this Troilus.
“And why?”—“For that thou sholdest never spede.”
“Wostow that wel?”—“Ye, that is out of drede,”
Quod Troilus, “for al that ever ye conne,
She nil to noon swich wrecche as I be wonne.”
Quod Pandarus, “Allas! what may this be,
That thou despeired art thus causelees?
What? liveth not thy lady? bendiste!
How wostow so that thou art gracelees?
Swich ivel is not alwey botelees.
Why, put not impossible thus thy cure,
Sin thing to come is ofte in aventure.
“I graunte wel that thou endurest wo
As sharp as doth he, Ticius, in helle,
Whos stomak foules tiren evermo
That highte volturis, as bokes telle.
But I may not endure that thou dwelle
In so unskilful an opinioun
That of thy wo is no curacioun.
“But ones niltow, for thy coward herte,
And for thin ire and folish wilfulnesse,
For wantrust, tellen of thy sorwes smerte,
Ne to thin owne help do bisinesse
As muche as speke a resoun more or lesse,
But liest as he that list of no thing recche.
What womman coude love swich a wrecche?
“What may she demen other of thy deeth,
If thou thus deie, and she not why it is,
But that for fere is yolden up thy breeth,
For Grekes han biseged us, ywis?
Lord, which a thank than shaltow han of this!
Thus wol she seyn, and al the toun at ones,
‘The wrecche is deed, the devel have his bones!’
“Thou mayst allone here wepe and crie and knele;
But, love a woman that she woot it nought,
And she wol quite that thou shalt not fele;
Unknowe, unkist, and lost that is unsought.
What! many a man hath love ful dere ybought
Twenty winter that his lady wiste,
That never yet his lady mouth he kiste.
“What? shulde he therfor fallen in despeir,
Or be recreaunt for his owene tene,
Or sleen himself, al be his lady fair?
Nay, nay, but ever in oon be fresh and grene
To serve and love his dere hertes quene,
And thenke it is a guerdoun hir to serve
A thousandfold more than he can deserve.”
And of that word took hede Troilus,
And thoughte anoon what folie he was inne,
And how that sothe him seide Pandarus,
That for to sleen himself might he not winne,
But bothe doon unmanhod and a sinne,
And of his deeth his lady nought to wite;
For of his wo, God woot, she knew ful lite.
And with that thought he gan ful sore sike,
And seide, “Allas! what is me best to do?”
To whom Pandare answerde, “If thee like,
The best is that thou telle me thy wo;
And have my trouthe, but thou finde it so,
I be thy bote, or that it be ful longe,
To peces do me drawe, and sithen honge!”
“Ye, so thou seyst,” quod Troilus tho, “allas!
But, God wot, it is not the rather so;
Ful hard were it to helpen in this cas,
For wel finde I that Fortune is my fo,
Ne al the men that riden conne or go
May of hir cruel wheel the harm withstonde;
For, as hir list, she pleieth with free and bonde.”
Quod Pandarus, “Than blamestow Fortune
For thou art wrooth, ye, now at erst I see;
Wostow nat wel that Fortune is commune
To every maner wight in som degree?
And yet thou hast this comfort, lo, pardee!
That, as hir joyes moten overgone,
So mote hir sorwes passen everichone.
“For if hir wheel stinte anything to torne,
Than cessed she Fortune anoon to be:
Now, sith hir wheel by no wey may sojorne,
What wostow if hir mutabilitee
Right as thyselven list, wol doon by thee,
Or that she be not fer fro thin helpinge?
Paraunter, thou hast cause for to singe!
“And therfor wostow what I thee beseche?
Lat be thy wo and turning to the grounde;
For whoso list have heling of his leche,
To him bihoveth first unwrie his wounde.
To Cerberus in helle ay be I bounde,
Were it for my suster, al thy sorwe,
By my wil, she sholde al be thin tomorwe.
“Loke up, I seye, and tel me what she is
Anoon, that I may goon about thy nede;
Knowe ich hir ought? for my love, tel me this;
Than wolde I hopen rather for to spede.”
Tho gan the veine of Troilus to blede,
For he was hit, and wex al reed for shame;
“A ha!” quod Pandare, “here biginneth game!”
And with that word he gan him for to shake,
And seide, “Theef, thou shalt hir name telle.”
But tho gan sely Troilus for to quake
As though men sholde han lad him into helle,
And seide, “Allas! of al my wo the welle,
Than is my swete fo called Criseyde!”
And wel nigh with the word for fere he deide.
And whan that Pandare herde hir name nevene,
Lord, he was glad, and seide, “Freend so dere,
Now fare aright, for Joves name in hevene,
Love hath biset the wel, be of good chere;
For of good name and wisdom and manere
She hath ynough, and eek of gentilesse;
If she be fair, thow wost thyself, I gesse.
“Ne I never saw a more bountevous
Of hir estat, ne gladder, ne of speche
A freendlier, ne a more gracious
For to do wel, ne lasse had nede seche
What for to doon; and al this bet to eche,
In honour, to as fer as she may strecche,
A kinges herte semeth by hires a wrecche.
“And forthy loke of good comfort thou be;
For certeinly, the firste point is this
Of noble corage thou ordeine thee,
A man to han pees with himself, ywis;
So oughtest thou, for nought but good it is
To loven wel, and in a worthy place;
Thee oughte not to clepe it hap, but grace.
“And also think, and therwith glade thee,
That sith thy lady vertuous is al,
So folweth it that ther is som pitee
Amonges al thise othere in general;
And forthy see that thou, in special,
Requere nought that is ayein hir name;
For vertue streccheth not himself to shame.
“But wel is me that ever I was born,
That thou biset art in so good a place;
For by my trouthe, in love I dorste have sworn,
Thee sholde never han tid thus fair a grace;
And wostow why? for thou were wont to chace
At love in scorn, and for despit him calle
‘Seint Idiot, lord of thise foles alle.’
“How often hastow maad thy nice japes,
And seid, that loves servants everichone
Of nicetee ben verray gidde apes;
And some wolde mucche hir mete alone,
Ligging abedde, and make hem for to grone;
And som, thou seidest, hadde a blaunche fevere,
And preidest God he shold never kevere!
“And some of hem toke on hem, for the colde,
More than ynough, so seidestow ful ofte;
And some han feined ofte time, and tolde
How that they wake, whan they slepen softe;
And thus they wolde han brought hemself alofte,
And nathelees were under at the laste;
Thus seidestow, and japedest ful faste.
“Yet seidestow, that, for the more part,
These loveres wolden speke in general,
And thoughten that it was a siker art,
For failing, for to assayen overal.
Now may I jape of thee, if that I shal!
But nathelees, though that I sholde deie,
That thou art noon of tho, I dorste seye.
“Now beet thy brest, and sey to god of love,
‘Thy grace, lord! for now I me repente
If I misspak, for now myself I love’:
Thus sey with al thin herte in good entente.”
Quod Troilus, “A! lord! I me consente,
And pray to thee my japes thou foryive,
And I shal never more whil I live.”
“Thow seyst wel,” quod Pandare, “and now I hope
That thou the goddes wrathe hast al apesed;
And sithen thou hast wepen many a drope,
And seid swich thing wherwith thi god is plesed,
Now wolde nevere god but thou were esed;
And think wel, she of whom rist al thy wo
Hereafter may thy comfort been also.
“For thilke ground, that bereth the wedes wikke,
Bereth eek thise holsom herbes, as ful ofte
Next the foule netle, rough and thikke,
The rose waxeth swote and smothe and softe;
And next the valey is the hil alofte;
And next the derke night the glade morwe;
And also joye is next the fin of sorwe.
“Now loke that atempre be thy bridel,
And, for the beste, ay suffre to the tide,
Or elles al our labour is on idel;
He hasteth wel that wisly can abide;
Be diligent, and trewe, and ay wel hide.
Be lusty, free, persevere in thy servise,
And al is wel, if thou werke in this wise.
“But he that parted is in every place
Is nowher hool, as writen clerkes wise;
What wonder is, though swich oon have no grace?
Eek wostow how it fareth of som servise?
As plaunte a tre or herbe, in sondry wise,
And on the morwe pulle it up as blive,
No wonder is, though it may never thrive.
“And sith that god of love hath thee bistowed
In place digne unto thy worthinesse,
Stond faste, for to good port hastow rowed;
And of thyself, for any hevinesse,
Hope alwey wel; for, but if drerinesse
Or overehaste our bothe labour shende,
I hope of this to maken a good ende.
“And wostow why I am the lasse afered
Of this matere with my nece trete?
For this have I herd seide of wise ylered,
‘Was never man ne woman yet bigete
That was unapt to suffren loves hete
Celestial, or elles love of kinde’;
Forthy som grace I hope in hir to finde.
“And for to speke of hir in special,
Hir beautee to bithinken and hir youthe,
It sit hir nought to be celestial
As yet, though that hir liste bothe and couthe.
But trewely, it sate hir wel right nouthe
A worthy knight to loven and cherice,
And but she do, I holde it for a vice.
“Wherfore I am, and wol be, ay redy
To peine me to do yow this servise;
For bothe yow to plese thus hope I
Herafterward; for ye beth bothe wise,
And conne it counseil kepe in swich a wise,
That no man shal the wiser of it be;
And so we may be gladed alle three.
“And, by my trouthe, I have right now of thee
A good conceit in my wit, as I gesse,
And what it is, I wol now that thou see.
I thenke, sith that Love, of his goodnesse,
Hath thee converted out of wikkednesse,
That thou shalt be the beste post, I leve,
Of al his lay, and most his foos to greve.
Ensample why, see now these wise clerkes,
That erren aldermost ayein a lawe,
And ben converted from hir wikked werkes
Thorugh grace of God, that list hem to him drawe,
Than arn they folk that han most God in awe,
And strengest feithed been, I understonde,
And conne an errour alderbest withstonde.”
Whan Troilus had herd Pandare assented
To been his help in loving of Criseyde,
Wex of his wo, as who seith, untormented,
But hotter wex his love, and thus he seide,
With sobre chere, although his herte pleide,
“Now blisful Venus helpe, er that I sterve,
Of thee, Pandare, I may som thank deserve.
“But, dere frend, how shal min wo ben lesse
Til this be doon? and goode, eek tel me this,
How wiltow seyn of me and my destresse?
Lest she be wrooth, this drede I most, ywis,
Or nil not here or trowen how it is.
Al this drede I, and eek for the manere
Of thee, hir eem, she nil no swich thing here.”
Quod Pandarus, “Thou hast a ful gret care
Lest that the cherl may falle out of the mone!
Why, Lord! I hate of thee thy nice fare!
Why, entremete of that thou hast to done!
For Goddes love, I bidde thee a bone,
So lat m’alone, and it shal be thy beste.”—
“Why, freend,” quod he, “now do right as thee leste.
“But herke, Pandare, o word, for I nolde
That thou in me wendest so greet folie,
That to my lady I desiren sholde
That toucheth harm or any vilenie;
For dredelees, me were lever die
Than she of me ought elles understode
But that, that mighte sounen into gode.”
Tho lough this Pandare, and anoon answerde,
“And I thy borw? Fy! no wight dooth but so;
I roughte nought though that she stode and herde
How that thou seyst; but fare wel, I wol go.
Adieu! be glad! God spede us bothe two!
Yif me this labour and this besinesse,
And of my speed be thin al that swetnesse.”
Tho Troilus gan doun on knees to falle,
And Pandare in his armes hente faste,
And seide, “Now, fy on the Grekes alle!
Yet, pardee, God shal helpe us at the laste;
And dredelees, if that my lif may laste,
And God toforn, lo, som of hem shal smerte;
And yet m’athinketh that this avaunt me asterte!
“Now, Pandare, I can no more seye,
But thou wis, thou wost, thou mayst, thou art al!
My lif, my deeth, hool in thin honde I leie;
Help now,” quod he. “Yis, by my trouthe, I shal.”
“God yelde thee, freend, and this in special,”
Quod Troilus, “That thou me recomaunde
To hir that to the deeth me may comaunde.”
This Pandarus tho, desirous to serve
His fulle freend, than seide in this manere,
“Farwel, and thenk I wol thy thank deserve;
Have here my trouthe, and that thou shalt wel here.”—
And wente his wey, thenking on this matere,
And how he best mighte hir beseche of grace,
And finde a time therto, and a place.
For every wight that hath an hous to founde
Ne renneth nought the werk for to biginne
With rakel hond, but he wol bide a stounde,
And sende his hertes line out fro withinne
Alderfirst his purpos for to winne.
Al this Pandare in his herte thoughte,
And caste his werk ful wisly, or he wroughte.
But Troilus lay tho no lenger doun,
But up anoon upon his stede bay,
And in the feld he pleide tho leoun;
Wo was that Greek that with him met that day.
And in the toun his maner tho forth ay
So goodly was, and gat him so in grace,
That ech him loved that loked on his face.
For he bicom the frendlieste wight,
The gentileste, and eek the moste free,
The thriftieste and oon the beste knight,
That in his time was, or mighte be.
Dede were his japes and his crueltee,
His heighe port and his manere estraunge,
And ech of tho gan for a vertu chaunge.
Now lat us stinte of Troilus a stounde,
That fareth lik a man that hurt is sore,
And is somdel of akinge of his wounde
Ylissed wel, but heled no del more:
And, as an esy pacient, the lore
Abit of him that gooth aboute his cure;
And thus he drieth forth his aventure.
