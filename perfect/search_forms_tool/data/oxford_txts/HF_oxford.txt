¶God turne us every dreem to gode!°
For it is wonder, be the rode,°
To my wit, what causeth swevens°
Either on morwes, or on evens;°
And why the effect folweth of somme,°
And of somme it shal never come;
Why that is an avisioun,°
And this a revelacioun,°
Why this a dreem, why that a sweven,
And nought to every man liche even;°
Why this a fantom,° these oracles,°
I noot;° but whoso of these miracles°
The causes knoweth bet than I,
Devine he;° for I certeinly
Ne can hem noght, ne never thinke
To besily my wit to swinke,°
To knowe of hir signifiaunce
The gendres,° neither the distaunce°
Of times of hem, ne the causes,
Forwhy this more than that cause is;
As if folkes complexiouns°
Make hem dreme of reflexiouns;°
Or ellis thus, as other sayne,°
For° to greet feblenesse of braine,
By abstinence,° or by seknesse,
Prison, stewe,° or greet distresse;
Or elles by disordinaunce°
Of naturel acustumaunce,°
That som man is to curious°
In studie, or melancolious,
Or thus so inly ful of drede,°
That no man may him bote bede;°
Or elles, that devocioun°
Of somme, and contemplacioun
Causeth swiche dremes ofte;
Or that the cruel lif unsofte
Which these ilke lovers leden°
That hopen over muche or dreden,
That purely hir impressiouns°
Causeth hem avisiouns;°
Or if that spirites° have the might
To make folk to dreme anight
Or if the soule, of propre kinde°
Be so parfit,° as men finde,
That it forwot° that is to come,
And that hit warneth alle and somme
Of everiche of hir aventures°
Be avisiouns,° or by figures,°
But that our flesh ne hath no might
To understonden it aright,
For it is warned to° derkly;°—
But why the cause is, noght wot° I.
 
¶Wel worthe,° of this thing, grete clerkes,
That trete of° this and other werkes;
For I of noon opinioun
Nil° as now make mensioun,
But only that the holy rode°
Turne° us every dreem to gode!
 
¶For never, sith° that I was born,
Ne no man elles, me biforn,
Mette,° I trowe° stedfastly,
So wonderful a dreem as I
The tenthe day now of Decembre,
The which, as I can now remembre,
I wol yow tellen every del.°
 
¶But at my ginning, trusteth wel,
I wol make invocacioun,
With special devocioun,
Unto the god of slepe anoon,
That dwelleth in a cave of stoon
Upon a streem that cometh fro Lete,°
That is a flood° of helle unswete;°
Beside a folk men clepe Cimerie,°
Ther° slepeth ay this god unmerie°
With his slepy thousand sones
That alway for to slepe hir wone° is—
And to this god, that I of rede,°
Prey I, that he wol me spede°
My sweven° for to telle aright,
If every dreem stonde in his might.°
And he, that mover is of al
That is and was, and ever shal,
So yive° hem joye that it here°
Of alle that they dreme to-yere,°
And for to stonden alle in grace
Of hir loves, or in what° place
That hem wer levest° for to stonde,
And shelde° hem fro poverte and shonde,°
And fro unhappe° and eche disese,°
And sende hem al that may hem plese,
That° take it wel, and scorne it noght,
Ne it misdemen° in her thoght
Through malicious entencioun.
And whoso,° through presumpcioun,
Or hate or scorne, or through envie,
Dispit,° or jape,° or vilanie,°
Misdeme° it, preye I Jesus God
That (dreme he barfoot,° dreme he shod),°
That every harm that any man
Hath had, sith that the world began,
Befalle him therof, or he sterve,°
And graunte° he mote it ful deserve,
Lo! with swich a conclusioun
As had of his avisioun
Cresus, that was king of Lyde,°
That high upon a gebet° dide!
This prayer shal he have of me;
I am no bet° in charite!
 
¶Now herkneth,° as I have you seid,
What that I mette or I abreid.°
Of Decembre the tenthe day,
Whan it was night, to slepe I lay
Right ther as I was wont° to done,
And fil on slepe wonder sone,°
As he that wery was forgo°
On° pilgrimage miles two
To the corseint Leonarde,°
To make lithe° of that° was harde.
But as I slept, me mette° I was
Within a temple ymade° of glas;
In whiche ther were mo images
Of gold, stondinge in sondry stages,°
And mo riche tabernacles°
And with perre° mo pinacles,
And mo curious° portreitures,
And queinte° maner of figures
Of olde werke, then I saw ever.
 
¶For certeinly, I niste never
Wher that I was, but wel wiste I
Hit was of Venus redely,°
The temple; for, in portreiture,
I sawgh anoonright° hir figure
Naked fletinge° in a see.
And also on hir heed, parde,°
Hir rose-garlonde whit and rede,
And hir comb to kembe° hir hede,
Hir dowves,° and daun° Cupido
Hir blinde sone, and Vulcano,
That in his face was ful broun.
But as I romed up and doun,
I fond that on a wal ther was
Thus writen, on a table° of bras:
“I wol now singe, if that I can,
The armes, and also the man,
That first cam, through his destinee,
Fugitif of Troy contree,
In Itaile, with ful moche pine,°
Unto the strondes° of Lavine.”°
And tho began the story anoon,
As I shal telle yow echoon.°
First saw I the destruccioun
Of Troye, through the Greek Sinoun,
That with his false forsweringe,°
And his chere° and his lesinge°
Made° the hors broght into Troye,
Thorgh which Troyens loste al hir joye.
And after this was grave,° allas!
How Ilioun° assailed was
And wonne, and King Priam yslain,
And Polites his son, certain,
Dispitously,° of° dan Pirrus.
 
¶And next that saw I how Venus,
Whan that she saw the castel brende,°
Doun fro the hevene gan descende,
And bad° hir sone Eneas flee;
And how he fledde, and how that he
Escaped was from al the pres,°
And took his fader, Anchises,
And bar him on his bakke away,
Cryinge, “Allas, and welaway!”
The whiche Anchises in his honde
Bar the goddes of the londe,
Thilke that unbrende° were.
And I saw next, in al this fere,°
How Creusa, daun Eneas wife,
Which that he lovede as his life,
And hir yonge son Julo;
And eek Ascanius also,
Fledden eek with drery chere,°
That it was pitee for to here;
And in a forest, as they wente,
At a turninge of a wente,°
How Creusa was ylost, allas!
That deed,° but noot° I how, she was;
How he hir soughte, and how hir goste°
Bad him to flee the Grekes oste,°
And seide he most° unto Itaile,
As was his destinee, sauns faille;°
That it was pitee for to here,
Whan hir spirit gan appere,
The wordes that she to him seide,
And for to kepe° hir son him preide.
Ther saw I graven eek how he,
His fader eek, and his meinee,°
With his shippes gan to saile
Toward the contree of Itaile,
As streight as that they mighte go.
 
¶Ther saw I thee, cruel Juno,
That art daun Jupiteres wife,
That hast yhated, al thy life,
Al the Troyanisshe bloode,
Renne and crie, as thou were woode,°
On Eolus, the god of windes,
To blowen out, of alle kindes,
So loude, that he shulde drenche°
Lord and lady, grome and wenche,°
Of al the Troyan nacioun,
Withoute any savacioun.
 
¶Ther saw I swich tempeste arise,
That every herte mighte agrise,°
To see it peinted on the walle.
Ther saw I graven eek withalle,
Venus, how ye, my lady dere,
Weping with ful woful chere,°
Prayen Jupiter an hie°
To save and kepe° that navie
Of the Troyan Eneas,
Sith that he hir sone was.
 
¶Ther saw I Joves Venus kisse,
And graunted of the tempest lisse.°
Ther saw I how the tempest stente,°
And how with alle pine° he wente,
And prevely° took arrivage°
In the contree of Cartage;°
And on the morwe, how that he
And a knight, hight° Achatee,
Metten with Venus that day,
Goinge in a queint array,°
As° she had ben an hunteresse,
With wind blowinge upon hir tresse;
How Eneas gan him to pleine,°
Whan that he knew hir, of his peine;
And how his shippes dreinte° were,
Or elles lost, he niste° where;
How she gan him comforte tho,
And bad him to Cartage go,
And ther he shulde his folke finde
That in the see were left behinde.
 
¶And, shortly of this thing to pace,
She made Eneas so in grace
Of Dido, quene of that contree,
That, shortly for to tellen, she
Becam his love, and leet him do
Al that wedding longeth to.°
What° shulde I speke more queinte,°
Or peine me° my wordes peinte,°
To speke of love? it wol not be;
I can° not of that facultee.°
And eek to telle the manere
How they aqueinteden infere,°
Hit were a long proces° to telle,
And over long for yow to dwelle.
 
¶Ther sawgh I grave how Eneas
Tolde Dido every cas,°
That him was tid° upon the see.
And after grave was, how shee
Made of him, shortly, at oo worde,°
Hir lif, hir love, hir luste, hir lorde;
And dide him al the reverence,°
And leide on him al the dispence,°
That any woman mighte do,
Weninge° it had al be so,
As he hir swoor; and herby demed°
That he was good, for he swich semed.
Allas! what harm doth apparence,
Whan it is fals in existence!
For he to hir a traitour was;
Wherfor she slow° hirself, allas!
 
¶Lo, how a woman doth amis,
To love him that unknowen is!
For, by Crist, lo! thus it fareth;°
“Hit is not al gold, that glareth.”°
For, also brouke I° wel min heed,
Ther may be under goodliheed°
Kevered many a shrewed° vice;
Therfor be no wight so nice,°
To take a love only for chere,°
For speche, or for frendly manere;
For this shal every woman finde
That som man, of his pure kinde,°
Wol shewen outward the faireste,
Til he have caught that what him leste;°
And thanne wol he causes finde,
And swere how that she is unkinde,
Or fals, or prevy, or double° was.
Al this seye I by° Eneas
And Dido, and hir nice lest,°
That lovede al to sone a gest;°
Therfor I wol seye a proverbe,
That he that fully knoweth th’erbe°
May saufly° leye it to his ye”;°
Withoute dreed,° this is no lie.°
 
¶But let us speke of Eneas,
How he betrayed hir, allas!
And lefte hir ful unkindely.°
So whan she saw al utterly,°
That he wolde hir of trouthe° faile,
And wende° fro hir into Itaile,
She gan to wringe hir hondes two.
“Allas!” quod she, “what me is wo!,
Allas! is every man thus trewe,°
That every yere wolde have a newe,°
If it so longe time dure,
Or elles three, peraventure?°
As thus: of° oon he wolde have fame
In magnifying of his name;
Another for frendship, seith he;
And yett ther shal the thridde be,
That shal be taken for delite,°
Lo, or for singular profite.”°
 
¶In swiche wordes gan to pleine°
Dido of hir peine,
As me mette redely;°
Non other auctour° alegge° I.
“Allas!” quod she, “My swete herte,
Have pitee on my sorwes smerte,
And slee me not! go noght away!
O woful Dido, wel away!”
Quod she to hirselve tho.°
“O Eneas! what wil ye do?
O, that your love, ne your bonde,
That ye han sworn with your right honde,
Ne my cruel deeth,” quod she,
“May holde yow still heer with me!
O, haveth of my deeth pitee!
Ywis,° my dere herte, ye
Knowen ful wel that never yit,
As ferforth° as I hadde wit,
Agilte I yow° in thoght ne deed.
O, have ye men swich goodeliheed
In speche, and never a deel° of trouthe?
Allas, that ever hadde routhe°
Any woman on any man!
Now see I wel, and telle can,
We wrecched wimmen con° non arte;°
For certein, for the more parte,
Thus we be served everichone.
How sore that ye men kon grone,
Anoon° as we have yow received!
Certeinly we ben deceived;
For, though your love laste a sesoun,
Waite upon the conclusioun,
And eek how that ye determinen,°
And for the more part diffinen.°
“O, welawey that I was born!
For through yow is my name° lorne,°
And alle min actes red and songe
Over al this lond, on every tonge.
O wikke Fame! for ther nis°
No thing so swift, lo, as she is!
O, sooth is, every thing is wist,°
Though it be kevered with the mist.
Eek, thogh I mighte duren ever,
That I have doon, rekever I never,
That° I ne shal be seid, allas,
Yshamed be through Eneas,
And that I shal thus juged be—
‘Lo, right as she hath doon, now she
Wol do eftsones, hardily’;°
Thus seith the peple prevely.”°—
 
¶But that° is doon, nis not to done;°
Al hir compleint ne al hir mone,
Certein, availeth hir not a stre.°
And when she wiste° sothly he
Was forth unto his shippes goon,
She in hir chambre wente anoon,
And called on hir suster Anne,
And gan hir to compleine thanne;
And seide, that she cause was°
That she first lovede him alas,
And thus counseilled hir therto.
But what! when this was seid and do,
She roof° hirselve to the herte,
And deide through the wounde smerte.°
And al the maner how she deide,
And al the wordes that she seide,
Whoso to knowe it hath purpos,°
Reed Virgile in Eneidos°
Or the Epistle of Ovide,°
What that she wroot or° that she dide.
 
¶And nere it° to long to endite,°
By God, I wolde it here write.
But, welaway! the harm, the routhe,°
That hath betid° for swich untrouthe,°
As men may ofte in bokes rede,
And al day seen it yet in dede,
That for to thenken it, a tene° is.
Lo, Demophon, duk of Athenis,
How he forswor him° ful falsly,
And trayed° Phillis wikkedly,
That kinges doghter was of Trace,
And falsly gan his terme° pace;°
And when she wist° that he was fals,
She heng hirself right by the hals,°
For he had do hir swich untrouthe;°
Lo! was not this a wo and routhe?
Eek lo! how fals and reccheles°
Was to Breseida Achilles,
And Paris to Enone;
And Jason to Isiphile;
And eft Jason to Medea;
And Ercules to Dyanira;
For he left hir for Iole,
That made him cacche his deeth, parde.
How fals eek was he, Theseus;
That, as the story telleth us,
How he betrayed Adriane;
The devel be his soules bane!°
For had he laughed, had he loured,°
He moste have be al devoured,
If Adriane ne had ybe!
And, for she had of him pitee,
She made him fro the dethe escape,
And he made hir a ful fals jape;°
For aftir this, within a while
He lefte hir slepinge in an ile,°
Deserte alone, right in the see,
And stale away, and leet hir be;
And took hir suster Phedra tho
With him, and gan to shippe go.
And yet he had ysworn to here,
On al that ever he mighte swere,
That, so° she saved him his lif,
He wolde have take hir to his wif;
For she desired nothing elles,
In certein, as the book us telles.
 
¶But to excusen Eneas
Fulliche of al his greet trespas,
The book seith, Mercurie, sauns faile,°
Bad him go into Itaile,
And leve Auffrikes° regioun,
And Dido and hir faire toun.
Tho saw I grave,° how to Itaile
Daun Eneas is go to saile;
And how the tempest al began,
And how he lost his steresman,
Which that the stere,° or he took keep,°
Smot° overbord, lo! as he sleep.
 
¶And also sawgh I how Sibile
And Eneas, beside an ile,
To helle wente, for to see
His fader, Anchises the free.
How he ther fond Palinurus,
And Dido, and eek° Deiphebus;
And every tourment eek in helle
Saw he, which is long to telle.
Which whoso willeth for to knowe,
He most rede many a rowe°
On Virgile or on Claudian,
Or Daunte, that it telle can.
 
¶Tho saw I grave al th’arivaile
That Eneas had in Itaile;
And with King Latine his tretee,°
And alle the batailles that he
Was at himself, and eek his knightes,
Or° he had al ywonne his rightes;°
And how he Turnus refte° his life,
And wan Lavina to his wife;
And al the mervelous signals°
Of the goddes celestials;°
How, maugre° Juno, Eneas,
For al hir sleighte and hir compas,°
Acheved al his aventure;°
For Jupiter took of him cure°
At the prayere of Venus;
The whiche I preye alwey save us,
And us ay of our sorwes lighte!°
 
¶Whan I had seyen al this sighte
In this noble temple thus,
“A, Lord!” thoughte I, “that madest us,
Yet saw I never swich noblesse
Of images, ne such richesse,
As I saw graven in this chirche;
But not woot I° who did hem wirche,
Ne wher I am, ne in what contree.
But now wol I go out and see,
Right at the wiket,° if I can
See owher° any stering° man,
That may me telle wher I am.”
 
¶When I out at the dores cam,
I faste° aboute me behelde.°
Then saw I but a large felde,
As fer as that I mighte see,
Withouten toun, or hous, or tree,
Or bush, or gras, or ered° londe;
For al the feld nas but of sonde°
As smal° as man may see yet lye
In the desert of Libye;
Ne I no maner creature,
That is yformed by nature,
Ne saw me for to rede or wisse.°
 
¶“O Crist,” thoughte I, “that art in blisse,
Fro fantom and illusioun°
Me save!” and with devocioun
Min yën° to the heven I caste.
 
¶Tho was I war,° lo! at the laste,
That faste be° the sonne, as hie
As kenne mighte° I with min ye,
Me thoughte I saw an egle sore,°
But that it semed moche more°
Then I had any egle seyn.
But this as sooth as deeth, certein,
Hit was of golde, and shoon so brighte,
That never saw men such a sighte,
But if° the heven had ywonne°
Al newe of golde another sonne;
So shoon the egles fethres brighte,
And somwhat dounward gan it lighte.°

¶Now herkneth,° every maner man
That English understonde can,
And listeth° of my dreem to lere;°
For now at erste° shul ye here
So selly° an avisioun,
That I say, ne Scipioun,
Ne King Nabugodonosor,
Pharo, Turnus, ne Elcanor,
Ne mette° swich a dreem as this!
 
¶Now faire blisfull, O Cipris,°
So be my favor° at this time!
And ye, me to endite and rime°
Helpeth, that on Parnaso dwelle
By Elicon the clere welle.°
O thought, that wroot al that I mette,°
And in the tresorie it shette°
Of my brain! now shal men see
If any vertu° in thee be,
To tellen al my dreem aright;
Now kithe thin engine and might!°
 
¶This egle, of which I have yow tolde,
That shoon with fethres as of golde,
Which that so hye gan to sore,
I gan beholde more and more,
To see the beautee and the wonder;
But never was ther dint of thonder,°
Ne that thing that men calle foudre,°
That smoot° somtime a tour to poudre,°
And in his swifte coming brende,°
That so swithe° gan descende,
As this foul, whan it behelde
That I aroume° was in the felde;
And with his grimme pawes° stronge,
Within his sharpe nailes longe,
Me, fleinge, at a swappe he hente,°
And with his sours° again up wente,
Me caryinge in his clawes starke°
As lightly as I were a larke,
How high I can not telle yow,
For I cam up, I niste° how.
For so astonied and asweved°
Was every vertu° in my heved,°
What with his sours° and with my drede,
That al my feling gan to dede;°
Forwhy it was to greet affray.°
 
¶Thus I longe in his clawes lay,
Til at the laste he to me spake
In mannes vois, and seide, “Awake!
And be not agast,° for shame!”
And called me tho by my name,
And, for I sholde the bet abreide°—
Me mette°—“Awak,” to me he seide,
Right in the same vois and stevene°
That useth oon° I coude nevene;°
And with that vois, soth for to sayn,
My minde cam to me again;
For it was goodly° seid to me,
So nas it never wont to be.
 
¶And herewithal I gan to stere,°
And he me in his feet° to bere,
Til that he felte that I had hete,°
And felte eek tho° min herte bete.
And tho gan he me to disporte,°
And with wordes to comforte,
And saide twies, “Seint Marie!
Thou art noyous° for to carie,
And nothing nedeth it,° parde!
For also wis God helpe me
As thou non harm shalt have of this;
And this cas,° that betid thee is,
Is for thy lore° and for thy prowe;°—
Let see! darst thou yet loke nowe?
Be ful assured, boldely,
I am thy frend.” And therwith I
Gan for to wondren in my minde.
“O God,” thoughte I, “that madest kinde,°
Shal I non other weyes die?
Wher Joves wol me stellifie,°
Or what thing may this signifie?
I neither am Enok, ne Elie,
Ne Romulus, ne Ganymede
That° were bore up, as men rede,
To heven with dan Jupiter,
And maad the goddes boteler.”°
Lo! this was tho my fantasie!
 
¶But he that bar me gan espie
That° I so thoghte, and seide this:—
“Thou demest° of thyself amis;
For Joves is not theraboute—
I dar wel put thee out° of doute—
To make of thee as yet a sterre.
But er I bere thee moche ferre,°
I wol thee telle what I am,
And whider thou shalt,° and why I cam
To done this, so that thou take
Good herte, and not for fere quake.”
“Gladly,” quod I. “Now wel,” quod he:—
“First I, that in my feet have thee,
Of which thou hast a feer and wonder,
Am dwellinge with the god of thonder,
Which that men callen Jupiter,
That dooth me flee° ful ofte fer
To do al his comaundement.
And for this cause he hath me sent
To thee: now herke, by thy trouthe!
Certein, he hath of thee routhe,°
That thou so longe trewely
Hast served so ententifly°
His blinde nevew° Cupido,
And fair Venus goddesse also,
Withoute guerdoun° ever yit,
And nevertheles hast set thy wit—
Although that in thy hed ful lite is—
To make bokes, songes and ditees°
In rime, or elles in cadence,°
As thou best canst, in reverence°
Of Love, and of his servants eke,
That have his servise soght, and seke;
And peinest thee to preise his arte,
Althogh thou haddest never parte;
Wherfor, also° God me blesse,
Joves halt it greet humblesse°
And vertu eek, that thou wolt make
Anight ful oft thin heed to ake,
In thy studie so thou writest,
And evermo of love enditest,°
In honour of him and preisinges,°
And in his folkes furtheringes,°
And in hir matere° al devisest,°
And noght him nor his folk despisest,
Although thou mayst go in the daunce
Of hem that him list not avaunce.°
¶“Wherfor, as I seide, ywis,
Jupiter considereth this,
And also, beau sir,° other thinges;
That is, that thou hast no tidinges°
Of Loves folk, if they be glade,
Ne of noght elles that God made;
And noght only fro fer contree°
That ther no tiding comth to thee,
But of thy verray neighebores,°
That dwellen almost at thy dores,
Thou herest neither that ne this;
For whan thy labour doon al is,
And hast ymaad thy rekeninges,°
In stede of reste and newe thinges,
Thou gost hoom to thy hous anoon;
And, also domb as any stoon,
Thou sittest at another boke,
Til fully daswed° is thy loke,°
And livest thus as an hermite,°
Although thin abstinence° is lite.
 
¶“And therfor Joves, through his grace,
Wol that I bere thee to a place,
Which that hight° The Hous of Fame,
To do thee som disport° and game,
In som recompensacioun
Of labour and devocioun
That thou hast had, lo! causeles,
To Cupido, the reccheles!°
And thus this god, thorgh his merite,
Wol with som maner thing thee quite,°
So that thou wolt be of good chere.
For truste wel, that thou shalt here,
When we be comen ther° I seye,
Mo wonder thinges, dar I leye:°
Of Loves folke mo tidinges,
Both soth-sawes and lesinges;°
And mo loves new begonne,
And longe yserved loves wonne,
And mo loves casuelly°
That been betid, no man wot why,
But as a blind man stert an hare;°
And more jolitee and fare,°
Whil that° they finde love of stele,°
As thinketh hem, and overal wele;°
Mo discords, mo jelousies,
Mo murmurs, and mo novelries,
And mo dissimulacions;
And feined reparacions;°
And mo berdes° in two houres
Withoute rasour or sisoures°
Ymaad, then greines be of sondes;°
And eke mo holdinge in hondes,°
And also mo renovelaunces°
Of olde forleten° aqueintaunces;
Mo love-dayes° and acordes°

And eke of loves mo eschaunges°
Than ever cornes° were in graunges;°
Unnethe° maistow trowen° this,”
Quod he. “No, help me God so wis!”—
Quod I. “No? why?” quod he. “For it
Were impossible, to my wit,
Though that Fame hadde al the pies°
In al a realme, and al the spies,
How that yet she shuld here al this,
Or they espie it.” “O yis, yis!”
Quod he to me, “That can I preve
By resoun, worthy for to leve,°
So that° thou yeve thin advertence°
To understonde my sentence.°
 
¶“First shalt thou heren wher she dwelleth,
And so thin owne book it telleth;
Hir paleis stant,° as I shal seye,
Right even in middes of the weye
Betwixen° hevene, erthe, and see;
That, whatsoever in al these three
Is spoken, in privee or aperte,°
The weye therto is so overte,°
And stant eek in so juste° a place,
That every soun mot° to it pace,
Or what so° comth fro any tonge,
Be it rouned,° red, or songe,
Or spoke in seurtee° or in drede,°
Certein, it moste thider nede.°
“Now herkne wel; forwhy I wille
Tellen thee a propre skile,°
And worth a demonstracioun
In min imaginacioun.
 
¶“Geffrey, thou wost° right wel this,
That every kindly thing° that is,
Hath a kindly stede° ther° he
May best in it conserved be;
Unto which place every thing,
Through his kindly enclining,°
Moveth for to come to,
Whan that it is awey therfro;
As thus: lo, thou mayst al day see
That any thing that hevy be,
As stoon or leed,° or thing of wighte,°
And ber it never so hie on highte,
Lat goo thin hand, it falleth doun.
 
¶“Right so, seye I, by fire or soun,°
Or smoke, or other thinges lighte,
Alwey they seke upward on highte;
Whil ech of hem is at his large,°
Light thing up, and dounward charge.°
 
¶“And for this cause mayst thou see,
That every river to the see
Enclined is to go, by kinde.°
And by these skilles,° as I finde,
Hath fish dwellinge° in floode° and see,
And trees eek in erthe be.
Thus every thing, by this resoun,
Hath his propre mansioun,°
To which it seketh to repaire,°
As ther it shulde not apaire.°
Lo, this sentence° is knowen couthe°
Of every philosophres mouthe,
As Aristotle and daun Platon,
And other clerkes many oon;
And to confirme my resoun,
Thou wost° wel this, that speche is soun,°
Or elles no man might it here;
Now herkne° what I wol thee lere.°
 
¶“Soun is noght but air ybroken,
And every speche that is spoken,
Loud or privee, foul or faire,
In his substaunce is but aire;
For as flaumbe is but lighted smoke,
Right so soun is air ybroke.
But this may be in many wise,
Of which I wil thee two devise,
Of soun that comth of pipe or harpe.
For whan a pipe is blowen sharpe,
The air is twist with violence,
And rent; lo, this is my sentence;°
Eek, whan men harpe-stringes smite,°
Whether it be moche or lite,°
Lo, with the strook the air tobreketh;°
Right so it breketh whan men speketh.
Thus wost thou wel what thing is speche.
 
¶“Now hennesforth I wol thee teche,
How every speche, or noise, or soun,
Through his multiplicacioun,°
Thogh it were piped of a mouse,
Moot nede° come to Fames House.
I preve it thus—tak hede now—
Be experience; for if that thou
Throwe on water now a stoon,
Wel wost thou, it wol make anoon
A litel roundel as a cercle,
Parauenter brood as a covercle;°
And right anoon thou shalt see weel,
That wheel wol cause another wheel,
And that the thridde, and so forth, brother,
Every cercle causinge other,
Wider than himselve was;
And thus, fro roundel to compas,°
Ech aboute other goinge,
Caused of othres steringe,°
And multiplying evermo,
Til that it be so fer ygo°
That it at bothe brinkes° be.
Althogh thou mowe it not ysee,
Above, it goth yet alway under,
Although thou thenke it a gret wonder.
And whoso seith of° trouthe I varie,
Bid him proven the contrarie.
And right thus every word, ywis,°
That loude or privee° spoken is,
Moveth first an air aboute,
And of this moving, out of doute,
Another air anoon is meved,°
As I have of the water preved,
That every cercle causeth other.
Right so of air, my leve° brother;
Everich air in other stereth°
More and more, and speche up bereth,
Or vois, or noise, or word, or soun,
Ay through multiplicacioun,°
Til it be atte House of Fame;—
Tak it in ernest or in game.
 
¶“Now have I told, if thou have minde,
How speche or soun, of pure kinde,°
Enclined is upward to meve;
This, mayst thou fele, wel I preve.
And that the mansioun,° ywis,
That every thing enclined to is,
Hath his kindeliche stede:°
That sheweth it, withouten drede,
That kindely° the mansioun
Of every speche, of every soun,
Be it either foul or fair,
Hath his kinde place in air.
And sin that every thing, that is
Out of his kinde place, ywis,
Moveth thider for to go
If it aweye be therfro,
As I before have preved thee,
Hit seweth,° every soun, pardee,
Moveth kindely to pace°
Al up into his kindely place.
And this place of which I telle,
Ther as Fame list° to dwelle,
Is set amiddes of these three,
Heven, erthe, and eek the see,
As most conservatif the soun.
Than is this the conclusioun,
That every speche of every man,
As I thee telle first began,
Moveth up on high to pace
Kindely to Fames place.
 
¶“Telle me this now feithfully,
Have I not preved thus simply,
Withouten any subtiltee°
Of speche, or gret prolixitee°
Of termes° of philosophie,
Of figures° of poetrie,
Or colours of rethorike?°
Pardee, it oghte thee to like;°
For hard langage and hard matere
Is encombrous for to here
At ones. Wost° thou not wel this?”
And I answerde, and seide, “Yis.”
“A ha!” quod he, “Lo, so I can,
Lewedly to a lewed man°
Speke, and shewe him swiche skiles,°
That he may shake hem by the biles,°
So palpable they shulden be.
But tel me this, now pray I thee,
How thinkth thee my conclusioun?”
Quod he. “A good persuasioun,”
Quod I, “hit is; and lik to be
Right so as thou hast preved me.”
“By God,” quod he, “and as I leve,°
Thou shalt have yit, or it be eve,
Of every word of this sentence
A preve,° by experience;
And with thin eres heren wel
Top and tail, and everydel,°
That every word that spoken is
Comth into Fames Hous, ywis,
As I have seid; what wilt thou more?”
 
¶And with this word upper to sore
He gan, and seide, “Be Seint Jame!
Now wil we speken al of game.”—
“How farest thou?”° quod he to me,
“Wel,” quod I. “Now see,” quod he,
“By thy trouthe, yond adoun,°
Wher° that thou knowest any toun,
Or hous, or any other thing.
And whan thou hast of ought knowing,°
Loke that thou warne° me,
And I anoon shal telle thee
How fer° that thou art now therfro.”
 
¶And I adoun gan loken tho,
And behelde feldes° and plaines,
And now hilles, and now mountaines,
Now valeis, and now forestes,
And now, unethes,° grete bestes;
Now riveres, now citees,
Now tounes, and now grete trees,
Now shippes saillinge in the see.
But thus sone in a while he
Was flowen fro the grounde so hie,
That al the world, as to min ye,
No more° semed than a prikke;
Or elles was the air so thikke
That I ne mighte not discerne.°
 
¶With that he spak to me as yerne,°
And seide: “Seestow any toun
Or ought thou knowest° yonder doun?”°
I seide, “Nay.” “No wonder nis,”
Quod he, “for half so high as this
Nas Alexander Macedo;
Ne the king, dan Scipio.
That saw in dreme, at point devis,°
Helle and erthe, and paradis;
Ne eek the wrecche° Dedalus,
Ne his child, nice° Icarus,
That fleigh so highe that the hete
His winges malt,° and he fel wete
Inmid the see, and ther he dreinte,°
For whom was maked moch compleinte.°
 
¶“Now turn upward,” quod he, “thy face,
And behold this large place,
This air; but loke thou ne be
Adrad° of hem that thou shalt see;
For in this regioun, certein,
Dwelleth many a citezein,°
Of which that speketh dan Plato.
These ben the eirish bestes,° lo!”
 
¶And so saw I al that meinee°
Bothe goon and also flee.°
“Now,” quod he tho, “cast up thin ye;
See yonder, lo, the Galaxie,
Which men clepeth° the Milky Wey,
For it is whit: and some, parfey,°
Callen it Watlinge Strete:
That ones was ybrent° with hete,
Whan the sonnes sone,° the rede,
That highte° Pheton, wolde lede°
Algate° his fader cart,° and gie.°
The cart-hors° gonne wel espie
That he ne coude no governaunce,°
And gonne for to lepe and launce,°
And beren him now up, now doun,
Til that he saw the Scorpioun,
Which that in heven a signe° is yit,
And he, for ferde,° loste his wit,
Of that, and leet the reines goon
Of his hors; and they anoon
Gonne up to mounte, and doun descende
Til bothe the eir and erthe brende;°
Til Jupiter, lo, atte laste,
Him slow,° and fro the carte caste.
Lo, is it not a greet mischaunce,
To lete a fole° han governaunce
Of thing that he can not demeine?”°
And with this word, soth for to seyne,
He gan alway upper° to sore,
And gladded me ay more and more,
So feithfully° to me spak he.
 
¶Tho gan I loken under me,
And beheld the eirish bestes
Cloudes, mistes, and tempestes,
Snowes, hailes, reines, windes,
And th’engendring° of hir kindes,
Al the wey through whiche I came.
“O God,” quod I, “that made Adame,
Moche is thy might and thy noblesse!”
And tho thoughte I upon Boece,°
That writ, “A thought may flee so hie,
With fetheres of Philosophie,
To passen everich° element;
And whan he hath so fer ywent,
Than may be seen, behind his bake,
Cloud, and al that I of spake.”
Tho gan I wexen in a were,°
And seide, “I woot wel I am here;
But wher° in body or in gost°
I noot, ywis; but God, thou wost!”
For more cleer entendement°
Nadde° he me never yit ysent.
And than thoughte I on Marcian,
And eek on Anteclaudian,
That sooth° was hir descripcioun
Of al the hevenes regioun,
As fer as that I saw the preve;°
Therfor I can hem now beleve.
 
¶With that this egle gan to crie:
“Lat be,” quod he, “thy fantasie;
Wilt thou lere of sterres aught?”°
“Nay, certeinly,” quod I, “right naught.”
“And why?” “For I am now to olde.”
“Elles I wolde thee have tolde,”
Quod he, “the sterres names, lo,
And al the hevens signes° therto,
And which they been.” “No fors,”° quod I.
“Yis, pardee,” quod he; “wostow why?
For when thou redest poetrie,
How goddes gonne stellifie°
Bride,° fish, or him or here,
As the Raven, or either Bere,
Or Ariones harpe fine,°
Castor, Pollux, or Delphine,
Or Atalantes doughtres sevene,
How alle these arn set in hevene;
For though thou have hem ofte on honde,
Yet nostow° not wher that they stonde.”°
“No fors,”° quod I, “hit is no nede;
I leve° as wel, so God me spede,
Hem that write of this matere,
As though I knew hir places here;
And eek they shinen here so brighte,
Hit shulde shenden° al my sighte
To loke on hem.” “That may wel be,”
Quod he. And so forth bar he me
A whil, and than he gan to crie,
That never herde I thing so hie,
“Now up the heed;° for al is wel;
Seint Julian, lo, bon hostel!°
See here the Hous of Fame, lo!
Maistow not heren that° I do?”
“What?” quod I. “The grete soun,”
Quod he, “that rumbleth up and doun
In Fames Hous, full of tidinges,
Bothe of feir speche and chidinges,°
And of fals and soth compouned.°
Herke wel; it is not rouned.°
Herestow not the grete swogh?”°
“Yis, pardee,” quod I, “wel ynogh.”
“And what soun is it lik?” quod he.
“Peter! lik beting of the see,”
Quod I, “again the roches holowe,
Whan tempest doth the shippes swalowe;
And lat a man stonde, out of doute,
A mile thens, and here it route;°
Or elles lik the last rumblinge
After a clappe of oo thundringe,
Whan Joves hath the aire ybete;°
But it doth me for fere swete.”°
“Nay, dred thee not thereof,” quod he,
“Hit is nothing wil biten thee;
Thou shalt non harme have, trewely.”
 
¶And with this word bothe he and I
As nigh the place arrived were
As men may casten with a spere.
I niste° how, but in a strete
He sette me faire on my fete,
And seide, “Walke forth a pace,
And tak thin aventure or case,°
That thou shalt finde in Fames place.”
“Now,” quod I, “whil we han space
To speke, or° that I go fro thee,
For the love of God, tel me,
In sooth, that wil I of thee lere,
If this noise that I here
Be as I have herd thee tellen,
Of folk that doun in erthe dwellen,
And cometh here in the same wise°
As I thee herde or this devise;°
And that ther lives body nis°
In al that house that yonder is
That maketh al this loude fare?”°
“No,” quod he, “by Seinte Clare,
And also wis God rede me!
But o thinge I wil warne thee
Of the which thou wolt have wonder.
Lo, to the House of Fame yonder
Thou wost how cometh every speche,
Hit nedeth noght thee eft° to teche.
But understond now right wel this;
Whan any speche ycomen is
Up to the paleis, anonright°
Hit wexeth° lik the same wight,°
Which that the word in erthe spak,
Be it clothed red or blak;
And hath so verray° his liknesse
That spak the word, that thou wilt gesse
That it the same body be,
Man or woman, he or she,
And is not this a wonder thing?”
“Yis,” quod I tho, “by hevene king!”
And with this word, “Farwel,” quod he,
“And here I wol abiden thee;°
And God of hevene sende thee grace,
Som good to lernen in this place,”
And I of him took leve anoon,
And gan forth to the paleis goon.

¶O god of science° and of light,
Apollo, through thy grete might,
This litel laste book thou gie!°
Nat that I wilne, for maistrie,°
Here art poetical be shewed;
But, for° the rim is light and lewed,°
Yit make it sumwhat agreable,
Though som vers faile in a sillable;
And that I do no diligence°
To shewe craft, but o sentence.°
And if, divine vertu,° thou
Wilt helpe me to shewe now
That° in min hede ymarked° is—
Lo, that is for to menen this,
The Hous of Fame to descrive°—
Thou shalt see me go, as blive,°
Unto the nexte laure° I see,
And kisse it, for it is thy tree;
Now entreth in my brest anoon!
 
¶Whan I was fro this egle goon,
I gan beholde upon this place.
And certein, or I ferther pace,
I wol yow al this shap devise
Of hous and cite; and al the wise
How I gan to this place aproche
That stood upon so high a roche,
Hyer stant ther noon in Spaine.
 
¶But up I clomb with alle paine,°
And though to climbe it greved me,
Yit I ententif° was to see,
And for to pouren° wonder lowe,°
If I coude any weyes knowe
What maner stoon this roche was;
For it was lik a thing of glas,
But that it shoon ful more clere;
But of what congeled° matere
Hit was, I niste redely.°
But at the laste espyed I,
And found that it was, every deel,
A roche of ise,° and not of steel.
Thoughte I, “By Seint Thomas of Kent!
This were a feble foundement°
To bilden on a place hie;
He ought him litel glorifie
That heron bilt, God so me save!”
¶Tho saw I al the half ygrave
With famous folkes names fele,°
That had ybeen in mochel wele,°
And hir fames wide yblowe.°
But wel unethes° coude I knowe
Any lettres for to rede
Hir names by; for, out of drede,
They were almost ofthawed° so,
That of the lettres oon or two
Was molte away° of every name,
So unfamous was wexe° hir fame;
But men seyn, “What may ever laste?”
 
¶Tho gan I in min herte° caste,°
That they were molte awey with hete,
And not awey with stormes bete.°
For on that other side I sey°
Of this hill, that northward lay,
How it was writen ful of names
Of folk that hadden grete fames
Of olde time, and yit they were
As fresshe as men had writen hem there
The selve day right,° or that houre
That I upon hem gan to poure.°
But wel I wiste° what it made;°
Hit was conserved with the shade—
Al this writing that I sy°—
Of a castel, that stood on hi,°
And stood eek on so cold a place,
That hete mighte it not deface.°
 
¶Tho gan I up the hill to goon,
And fond upon the coppe° a woon,°
That al the men that ben on live
Ne han the cunning° to descrive
The beautee of that ilke place,
Ne coude casten° no compace°
Swich another for to make,
That mighte of beautee be his make°
Ne so wonderliche ywrought;°
That it astonieth° yit my thought,
And maketh al my wit to swinke°
On this castel to bethinke.°
So that the grete beautee,
The cast,° the curiositee°
Ne can I not to yow devise,
My wit ne may me not suffise.
 
¶But natheles al the substance
I have yit in my remembrance;
Forwhy me thoughte, by Seint Gile!
Al was of stone of berile,°
Bothe castel and the tour,
And eek the halle, and every bour,°
Withouten peces° or joininges,°
But many subtil compassinges,°
Babewinnes° and pinacles,°
Imageries° and tabernacles,°
I saw; and ful eek of windowes,
As flakes falle in grete snowes.
And eek in ech of the pinacles
Weren sondry habitacles,°
In whiche stoden, al withoute—
Ful the castel,° al aboute—
Of alle maner of minstrales,°
And gestiours,° that tellen tales
Bothe of weping and of game,°
Of al that longeth unto Fame.
 
¶Ther herde I pleyen on an harpe
That sowned bothe wel and sharpe,°
Orpheus ful craftely,
And on his side, faste by,
Sat the harper Orion,
And Eacides Chiron,
And other harpers many oon,
And the Bret Glascurion;
And smale harpers with her glees°
Saten° under° hem in sees,°
And gunne on hem upward to gape,
And countrefete° hem as an ape,
Or as craft countrefeteth kinde.°
Tho saugh I stonden hem behinde,
Afer° fro hem, al by hemselve,
Many thousand times twelve,
That maden loude menstralcies
In cornemuse and shalmies,°
And many other maner pipe,
That craftely began to pipe
Bothe in doucet and in rede,°
That ben at festes with the brede;°
And many floute° and lilting-horne,°
And pipes made of grene corne,
As han thise litel herde-gromes°
That kepen° bestes in the bromes.°
Ther saugh I than Atiteris,
And of Athenes dan Pseustis,
And Marcia that lost her skin,
Bothe in face, body, and chin,
For that she wolde envien,° lo!
To pipen bet than Apollo.
Ther saugh I famous, olde and yonge,
Pipers of alle Duche° tonge,
To lerne hove-daunces, springes,°
Reyes,° and these straunge thinges.
 
¶Tho saugh I in another place
Stonden in a large space,
Of hem that maken blody° soun
In trumpe, beme,° and clarioun;
For in fight and blood-shedinge
Is used gladly clarioninge.
Ther herde I trumpen Messenus,
Of whom that speketh Virgilius.
Ther herde I Joab trumpe also,
Theodomas, and other mo;
And al that used clarion
In Cataloigne° and Aragon,
That in hir time famous were
To lerne, saugh I trumpe there.
 
¶Ther saugh I sitte in other sees,°
Pleyinge upon sondry glees,°
Whiche that I cannot nevene,°
Mo then sterres been in hevene,
Of whiche I nil as now not rime,
For ese of yow, and losse of time:
For time ylost, this knowen ye,
By no way may recovered be.
 
¶Ther saugh I pleyen jogelours,°
Magiciens and tregetours,°
And phitonesses,° charmeresses,
Olde wicches, sorceresses,
That usen exorsisaciouns,°
And eek thise fumigaciouns;°
And clerkes eek, which conne wel
Al this magik naturel,°
That craftely don hir ententes,°
To make, in certein ascendentes,°
Images, lo, through which magik
To make a man ben hool° or sik.
 
¶Ther saugh° I the queen Medea,
And Circes eke, and Calipsa;
Ther saugh I Hermes Ballenus,
Limote, and eek Simon Magus.
Ther saugh I, and knew hem by name,
That by such art don men han fame.
Ther saugh I Colle tregetour°
Upon a table of sicamour°
Pleye an uncouthe° thing to telle;
I saugh him carien a wind-melle°
Under a walsh-nute shale.°
 
¶What shuld I make lenger tale
Of al the peple I ther say,
Fro hennes into domesday?
Whan I had al this folk beholde,
And fond me lous, and noght yholde,°
And eft° ymused longe while
Upon these walles of berile,
That shoon ful lighter than a glas,
And made wel more° than it was
To semen, every thing, ywis,
As kinde thing° of fame is;
I gan forth romen til I fond
The castel-yate° on my right hond,
Which that so wel corven° was
That never swich another nas;
And yit it was by aventure°
Ywrought, as often as by cure.°
Hit nedeth noght yow more to tellen,
To make yow to longe dwellen,
Of this yates florisshinges,°
Ne of compasses,° ne of kervinges,
Ne how they hatte° in masoneries,°
As, corbetz° fulle of imageries.
But, Lord! so fair it was to shewe,°
For it was al with gold behewe.°
 
¶But in I wente, and that anoon;
Ther mette I crying many oon,—
“A larges, larges,° hold up wel!
God save the lady of this pel,°
Our owne gentil lady Fame,
And hem that wilnen to have name
Of us!” Thus herde I cryen alle,
And faste comen out of halle,
And shoken° nobles and sterlinges.°
And somme crouned were as kinges,
With crounes wroght ful of losenges;°
And many riban,° and many frenges°
Were on hir clothes trewely.
 
¶Tho atte laste aspied I
That pursevauntes and heraudes,°
That cryen riche folkes laudes,°
Hit weren alle; and every man
Of hem, as I yow tellen can,
Had on him throwen a vesture,
Which that men clepe a cote-armure,°
Enbrowded° wonderliche riche,
Although they nere nought iliche.°
But noght nil I, so mote I thrive,°
Been aboute to discrive°
Al these armes that ther weren,
That they thus on her cotes beren,
For it to me were impossible;
Men mighte make of hem a bible°
Twenty foot thikke, as I trowe.
For certein, whoso coude° yknowe
Mighte ther all the armes° seen
Of famous folk that han ybeen
In Auffrike, Europe, and Asie,
Sith first began the chevalrie,°
Lo! how shulde I now telle al this?
Ne of the halle eek what nede is
To tellen yow, that every wal
Of it, and floor, and roof and al
Was plated half a fote thikke
Of gold, and that nas nothing wikke,°
But, for to prove in alle wise,°
As fin as ducat° in Venise,
Of which to lite° al in my pouche is?
And they wer set as thikke of nouchis°
Fulle of the finest stones° faire,
That men rede in the Lapidaire,
As greses° growen in a mede;°
But it were al to long to rede
The names; and therfore I pace.°
 
¶But in this riche lusty place,
That Fames halle called was,
Ful moche prees° of folk ther nas,°
Ne crouding, for to mochil prees.
But al on hie, above a dees,°
Sitte° in a see° imperial,
That maad was of a rubee° al,
Which that a carbuncle° is called,
I saugh, perpetually ystalled,°
A feminine creature;
That never formed by nature
Nas° swich another thing yseie.°
For altherfirst,° soth for to seye,
Me thoughte° that she was so lite,°
That the lengthe of a cubite°
Was lenger° than she semed be;
But thus sone, in a while, she
Hir tho so wonderliche streighte,°
That with hir feet she th’erthe reighte,°
And with hir heed she touched hevene,
Ther° as shinen sterres sevene.
 
¶And therto eek, as to my wit,
I saugh a gretter wonder yit
Upon hir eyen to beholde;
But certein I hem never tolde;°
For as fele eyen° hadde she
As fetheres upon foules° be,
Or weren on the bestes° foure
That Goddes trone° gunne honoure,°
As John writ° in th’Apocalips.°
Hir heer, that oundy° was and crips,°
As burned° gold it shoon to see.
And sooth to tellen, also she
Had also fele upstonding eres°
And tonges, as on bestes heres;°
And on hir feet wexen° saugh I
Partriches winges redely.°
 
¶But, Lord! the perrie° and the richesse
I saugh sitting on this goddesse!
And, lord! the hevenish melodie
Of songes, ful of armonie,°
I herde aboute her trone° ysonge,
That al the paleis walles ronge!°
So song the mighty Muse, she
That cleped° is Caliopee,
And hir eighte sustren° eke,
That in hir face semen meke;°
And evermo, eternally,
They songe of Fame, as tho herde I:—
“Heried° be thou and thy name,
Goddesse of renoun and of fame!”
 
¶Tho was I war, lo, atte laste,
As I min eyen gan up caste,
That this ilke° noble quene
On hir shuldres gan sustene°
Bothe th’armes° and the name
Of tho that hadde large fame;
Alexander, and Hercules
That with a sherte his life lees!°
Thus fond I sitting this goddesse,
In nobley, honour, and richesse;
Of which I stinte° a while now,
Other thing to tellen yow.
 
¶Tho saugh I stonde on either side,
Streight doun to the dores wide,
Fro the dees, many a pileer°
Of metal, that shoon not ful cleer;
But though they nere° of no richesse,
Yet they were maad for greet noblesse,
And in hem greet and hi sentence,°
And folk of digne° reverence,
Of whiche I wil yow telle fonde,°
Upon the piler saugh I stonde.
 
¶Alderfirst,° lo, ther I sigh,
Upon a piler stonde on high,
That was of lede° and iren° fine,
Him of secte Saturnine,
The Ebraik Josephus, the olde,
That of Jewes gestes° tolde;
And bar upon his shuldres hie
The fame up of the Jewerie.°
 
¶And by him stoden other sevene,
Wise and worthy for to nevene,°
To helpen him bere up the charge,°
Hit was so hevy and so large.
And for they writen of batailes,
As wel as other olde mervailes,
Therfor was, lo, this pileer,
Of which that I yow telle heer,
Of lede and iren° bothe, ywis,
For iren Martes° metal is,
Which that god is of bataille;
And the leed, withouten faille,
Is, lo, the metal of Saturne,
That hath a ful large wheel° to turne.
Tho stoden forth, on every rowe,
Of hem° which that I coude knowe,°
Thogh I hem noght be ordre telle,
To make yow to long to dwelle.
 
¶These, of whiche I ginne rede,°
Ther saugh I stonden, out of drede:°
Upon an iren piler strong,
That peinted was, al endelonge,°
With tigres blode in every place,
The Tholosan° that highte° Stace,
That bar of Thebes up the fame
Upon his shuldres, and the name
Also of cruel Achilles.
 
¶And by him stood, withouten lees,°
Ful wonder hie on a pilere
Of iren, he, the gret Omere;°
And with him Dares and Titus
Before, and eek he Lollius,
And Guido eek de Columpnis,
And English Gaufride eek, ywis;
And ech of these, as have I joye,
Was besy° for to bere up Troye.
So hevy therof was the fame,
That for to bere it was no game.
But yit I gan ful wel espie,
Betwix hem was a litil envie.°
Oon seide, Omere made lies,
Feininge° in his poetries,
And was to Grekes favorable;°
Therfor held° he it but fable.°
 
¶Tho saugh I stonde on a pilere,
That was of tinned iren° clere,
That Latin poete, dan Virgile,
That bore hath up a longe while
The fame of Pius° Eneas.
And next him on a piler was,
Of coper,° Venus clerk, Ovide,
That hath ysowen° wonder wide
The grete god of Loves name.
And ther he bar up wel his fame,
Upon this piler, also hie
As I might see it with min ye:
Forwhy this halle, of whiche I rede°
Was woxe° on highte, lengthe and brede,°
Wel more, by a thousand del,°
Than it was erst,° that saugh I wel.
 
¶Tho saugh I, on a piler by,
Of iren wroght ful sternely,°
The grete poete, daun Lucan,
That on his shuldres bar up than,
As highe as that I mighte see,
The fame of Julius and Pompee.
And by him stoden alle these clerkes,
That writen of Romes mighty werkes,
That, if I wolde hir names telle,
Al to longe most I dwelle.
 
¶And next him on a piler stood
Of soulfre,° lik as he were wood,°
Dan Claudian, the soth to telle,
That bar up al the fame of helle,
Of Pluto, and of Proserpine,
That quene is of the derke pine.°
What shulde I more telle of this?
The halle was al ful, ywis,
Of hem that writen olde gestes,°
As ben on trees rokes° nestes;
But it a ful confus matere
Were al the gestes for to here,
That they of write, and how they highte.°
 
¶But whil that I beheld this sighte,
I herde a noise aprochen blive,°
That ferde as been° don in an hive,
Agen her time° of out fleyinge;
Right swiche a maner murmuringe,
For al the world, it semed me.
 
¶Tho gan I loke aboute and see,
That ther come entring in the halle
A right gret company withalle,
And that of sondry° regiouns,
Of alleskinnes° condiciouns,
That dwelle in erthe under the mone,
Pore and riche. And also sone°
As they were come into the halle,
They gonne doun on knees falle
Before this ilke noble quene,
And seide, “Graunte us, lady shene,°
Ech of us, of thy grace, a bone!”°
And somme of hem she graunted sone,
And som she werned wel and faire;°
And som she graunted the contraire
Of hir axing° utterly,
But thus I sey yow trewely,
What hir cause° was, I niste.°
For of this folk, ful wel I wiste,
They hadde good fame ech deserved,
Althogh they were diversly served;°
Right as hir suster, dame Fortune,
Is wont to serven° in comune.°
 
¶Now herkne° how she gan to paye°
That° gonne hir of hir grace praye;
And right, lo, al this companie
Seiden sooth,° and noght a lie.
“Ma dame,” seiden they, “we be
Folk that heer besechen thee,
That thou graunte us now good fame,
And let our werkes han that name;
In ful recompensacioun
Of good werk, give us good renoun.”
“I wern° yow it,” quod she anoon,
“Ye gete of me good fame noon,
By God! and therfor go your wey.”
“Alas,” quod they, “and welaway!
Telle us, what may your cause be?”
“For me list it noght,”° quod she;
“No wight shal speke of yow, ywis,
Good ne harm, ne that ne this.”
And with that word she gan to calle
Hir messanger, that was in halle,
And bad that he shuld faste goon,°
Up peine° to be blind anoon,
For Eolus, the god of winde;—
“In Trace° ther ye shul him finde,
And bid him bringe his clarioun,
That is ful divers of his soun,
And it is cleped Clere Laude,°
With which he wont is to heraude°
Hem that me list° ypreised be:
And also bid him how that he
Bringe his other clarioun,
That highte Sclaundre° in every toun,
With which he wont is to diffame
Hem that me list, and do hem shame.”
 
¶This messanger gan faste goon,
And found wher, in a cave of stoon,
In a contree that highte Trace,
This Eolus, with harde grace,°
Held the windes in distresse,°
And gan hem under him to presse,°
That they gonne as beres° rore,
He bond and pressed hem so sore.
This messanger gan faste crie,
“Ris up,” quod he, “and faste hie,°
Til that thou at my lady be;
And tak thy clarions eek with thee,
And speed the forth.” And he anon
Took° to a man, that hight Triton,
His clariouns to bere tho,
And leet a certein wind to go,
That blew so hidously° and hie,
That it ne lefte not a skie°
In al the welken° longe and brode.
This Eolus nowher abode°
Til he was come to Fames fete,
And eek the man that Triton hete;°
And ther he stood, as still as stoon.
 
¶And herwithal ther com anoon
Another huge companie
Of gode folk, and gunne crie,
“Lady, graunte us now good fame,
And lat our werkes han that name
Now, in honour of gentilesse,
And also God your soule blesse!
For we han wel deserved it,
Therfore is right that we ben quit.”°
“As thrive I, quod she ye shal faile,
Good werkes shal yow noght availe°
To have of me good fame as now.
But wite ye° what? Y graunte yow,
That ye shal have a shrewed° fame
And wikked loos,° and worse name,
Though ye good loos° have wel deserved.
Now go your wey, for ye be served;
And thou, dan Eolus, lat see!
Tak forth thy trumpe anon,” quod she,
“That is ycleped° Sclaunder light,°
And blow her loos,° that every wight
Speke of hem harm and shrewednesse,°
In stede of good and worthinesse.
For thou shalt trumpe al the contraire
Of that they han don wel or faire.”
 
¶“Alas,” thoughte I, “what aventures°
Han these sory creatures!
For they, amonges al the pres,°
Shul thus be shamed, gilteles!°
But what! it moste nedes be.”
What did this Eolus, but he
Tok out his blake trumpe of bras,
That fouler than the devil was,
And gan this trumpe for to blowe,
As al the world shulde overthrowe;°
That throughout every regioun
Went this foule trumpes soun,
As swift as pelet° out of gonne,°
Whan fir° is in the poudre ronne.°
And swiche a smoke gan outwende°
Out of his foule trumpes ende,
Blak, blo,° grenissh, swartish° rede,
As doth wher that men melte lede,°
Lo, al on high fro the tuel!°
And therto oo thing saugh I wel,
That, the ferther that it ran,
The gretter wexen it° began,
As doth the river from a welle,°
And it stank as the pit of helle.
Alas, thus was hir shame yronge,°
And giltelees, on every tonge.
 
¶Tho com the thridde companie,
And gunne up to the dees to hie,°
And doun on knees they fille anon,
And seide, “We ben everichon
Folk that han ful trewely
Deserved fame rightfully,
And prayen yow, it mot be knowe,
Right as it is, and forth yblowe.”
“I graunt,” quod she, “for now me list
That now your gode werkes be wist;°
And yet ye shul han better loos,°
Right in dispit° of al your foos,
Than worthy is;° and that anoon:°
Lat now,” quod she, “thy trumpe goon,°
Thou Eolus, that is so blake;
And out thin other trumpe take
That highte Laude,° and blow it so
That through the world hir fame go
Al esely,° and not to faste,
That it be knowen atte laste.”
“Ful gladly, lady min,” he seide;
And out his trumpe of golde he braide°
Anon, and sette it to his mouthe,
And blew it est, and west, and southe,
And north, as loude as any thunder,
That every wight° hath of it wonder,
So brode° it ran, or than it stente,°
And, certes, al the breeth that wente
Out of his trumpes mouthe smelde°
As men a pot ful of bawme° helde
Among a basket ful of roses;
This savour dide he til hir loses.°
 
¶And right with this I gan aspie,
Ther com the ferthe companie—
But certein they were wonder fewe—
And gonne stonden in a rewe,
And seiden, “Certes, lady brighte,
We han don wel with al our mighte;
But we ne kepen° have no fame.
Hide our werkes and our name,
For Goddes love! for certes we
Han certein doon it for bountee,°
And for no maner other thinge.”
“I graunte yow al your askinge,”
Quod she; “let your werk be dede.”
With that aboute I clew° min hede,
 
¶And saugh anoon the fifte route°
That to this lady gonne loute,°
And doun on knes anoon to falle;
And to hir tho besoughten° alle
To hide hir gode werkes eke,
And seid, they yeven noght a leke°
For no fame, ne swich renoun;
For they, for contemplacioun
And Goddes love, hadde ywrought;
Ne of fame wolde they nought.
“What?” quod she, “and be ye wode?°
And wene ye° for to do gode,
And for to have of that no fame?
Have ye dispit° to have my name?
Nay, ye shul liven everichoon!
Blow thy trumpe and that anoon,”
Quod she, “thou Eolus, I hote,°
And ring this folkes werkes by note,°
That al the world may of it here.”
And he gan blowe hir loos so clere
In his golden clarioun
That through the worlde went the soun,
Also kenely, and eek so softe;°
But atte laste it was onlofte.°
 
¶Thoo com the sexte companie,
And gonne faste on Fame crie.
Right verraily, in this manere
They seiden: “Mercy, lady dere!
To telle certein, as it is,
We han don neither that ne this,
But idel° al our lif ybe.
But, natheles, yit preye we,
That we mowe han as goode fame,
And greet renoun and knowen name,
As they that han don noble gestes,°
And acheved alle hir lestes,°
As wel of love as other thing;
Al was us never broche ne ring,
Ne elles noght,° from wimmen sent,
Ne ones in hir herte yment°
To make us only frendly chere,°
But mighte temen us on bere;°
Yit lat us to the peple seme
Swiche° as the world may of us deme,°
That wimmen loven us for wode.°
Hit shal don us as moche gode,
And to our herte as moche availe
To countrepeise° ese and travaile,°
As° we had wonne it with labour;
For that is dere boght° honour
At regard° of our grete ese.
And yit thou most us more plese
Let us be holden eek, therto,
Worthy, wise, and gode also,
And riche, and happy unto love.
For Goddes love, that sit above,
Thogh we may not the body have
Of wimmen, yet, so God yow save!
Let men glewe° on us the name;
Sufficeth° that we han the fame.”
“I graunt,” quod she, “by my trouthe!
Now, Eolus, withouten slouthe,°
Take out thy trumpe of gold, let see,
And blow as they han axed me,
That every man wene° hem at ese,
Though they gon in ful badde lese.”°
This Eolus gan it so blowe
That through the world it was yknowe.
 
¶Tho come the seventh route anoon,
And fel on knees everichoon,
And seide, “Lady, graunte us sone
The same thing, the same bone,°
That ye this nexte° folk han doon.”
“Fy on yow,” quod she, “everichoon!
Ye masty° swin, ye idel wrecches,
Ful of roten slowe tecches!°
What? false theves!° wher ye wolde
Be famous good, and nothing nolde
Deserve why, ne never roughte?°
Men rather yow tohangen oughte!
For ye be lik the sweinte° cat,
That wolde have fish; but wostow what?
He wolde nothing wete his clowes.°
Ivel thrift° come to your jowes,°
And eek to min, if I it graunte,
Or do favour, yow to avaunte!°
Thou Eolus, thou king of Trace!
Go, blow this folk a sory grace,”°
Quod she, “anoon; and wostow how?
As I shal telle thee right now;
Sey: ‘These ben they that wolden honour
Have, and do noskinnes° labour,
Ne do no good, and yit han laude;°
And that men wend° that bele Isaude°
Ne coude hem noght of love werne;°
And yet she that grint at a querne°
Is al to good to ese hir herte.’ ”
This Eolus anon up sterte,°
And with his blakke clarioun
He gan to blasen° out a soun,
As loude as belweth° wind in helle.
And eek therwith, the sooth to telle,
This soun was al so ful of japes,°
As ever mowes° were in apes.
And that wente al the world aboute,
That every wight gan on hem shoute,
And for to laughe as they were wode;°
Such game fond they in hir hode.°
 
¶Tho com another companie,
That had ydoon the traiterie,°
The harm, the gretest wikkednesse
That any herte couthe gesse;°
And prayed hir to han good fame,
And that she nolde hem doon no shame,
But yeve hem loos° and good renoun,
And do it blowe in clarioun.
“Nay, ywis!” quod she, “hit were a vice;
Al be ther in me no justice
Me listeth not° to do it now,
Ne this nil I not graunte you.”
 
¶Tho come ther lepinge in a route,°
And gonne choppen° al aboute
Every man upon the croune,°
That al the halle gan to soune,
And seiden: “Lady, lefe° and dere
We ben swich folk as ye mowe here.
To tellen al the tale aright,
We ben shrewes, every wight,°
And han delit in wikkednes,
As gode folk han in goodnes;
And joye to be knowen shrewes,
And fulle of vice and wikked thewes;°
Wherfor we prayen yow, arowe,
That our fame swich be knowe
In alle thing right as it is.”
“I graunte it yow,” quod she, “ywis.
But what art thou that seyst this tale,
That werest on thy hose° a pale,°
And on thy tipet° swiche a belle!”
“Ma dame,” quod he, “sooth to telle,
I am that ilke shrewe, ywis,
That brent° the temple of Isidis
In Athenes, lo, that citee.”
“And wherfor didest thou so?” quod she.
“By my thrift,”° quod he, “ma dame,
I wolde fain° han had a fame,
As other folk hadde in the toune,
Althogh they were of greet renoune
For hir vertu and for hir thewes;
Thoughte I, as greet a fame han shrewes,
Thogh it be but for shrewednesse,°
As gode folk han for goodnesse;
And sith I may not have that oon,
That other nil I noght forgoon.°
And for to gette of Fames hire,°
The temple sette I al afire.
Now do our loos° be blowen swithe,°
As wisly° be thou ever blithe.”°
“Gladly,” quod she; “thou Eolus,
Herestow not what they prayen us?”
“Ma dame, yis, ful wel,” quod he,
And I wil trumpen it, parde!”
And tok his blakke trumpe faste,
And gan to puffen and to blaste,
Til it was at the worldes ende.
 
¶With that I gan aboute wende;°
For oon that stood right at my bake,
Me thoughte goodly° to me spake,
And seide, “Frend, what is thy name?
Artow come hider to han fame?”
“Nay, forsothe,° frend!” quod I;
I cam noght hider, graunt mercy!
For no swich cause, by my hede!°
Sufficeth me, as I were dede,
That no wight° have my name in honde.°
I woot° myself best how I stonde;
For what I drie° or what I thinke,
I wol myselven al it drinke,°
Certein, for the more parte,
As ferforth as I can min arte.”°
“But what dost thou here?” quod he.
Quod I, “that wol I tellen thee,
The cause why I stonde here:—
Som newe tidings for to lere:°—
Som newe thinge, I not what,
Tidinges, other this or that,
Of love, or suche thinges glade.
For certeinly, he that me made
To comen hider seide me,
I shulde bothe here and see,
In this place, wonder° thinges;
But these be no such tidinges
As I mene of.” “No?” quod he,
And I answerde, “No, pardee!
For wel I wote,° ever yit,
Sith that first I hadde wit,
That som folk han deserved fame
Diversly,° and loos, and name;
But certeinly, I niste° how
Ne wher that Fame dwelte, er now;°
Ne eek of hir descripcioun,
Ne also hir condicioun,°
Ne the ordre° of hir dome,°
Unto the time I hider come.”
 
¶“Whiche be, lo, these tidinges,
That thou now thus hider bringes,
That thou hast herd?” quod he to me;
“But now, no fors;° for wel I see
What thou desirest for to here.
Com forth, and stond no longer here,
And I wol thee, withouten drede,
In swich another place lede,
Ther thou shalt here many oon.”
Tho gan I forth with him to goon
Out of the castel, soth to seye.
Tho saugh I stonde in a valeye,
Under° the castel, faste by,°
An hous, that Domus Dedaly,
That Laborintus cleped° is,
Nas maad so wonderliche, ywis,
Ne half so queinteliche° ywrought.
And evermo, so swift as thought,
This queinte hous aboute wente,
That never mo it stille stente.°
And therout com so greet a noise,
That, had it stonden upon Oise,°
Men mighte han herd it esely
To Rome, I trowe sikerly.°
And the noise which that I herde,
For al the world right so it ferde,
As doth the routing° of the stoon
That from th’engin° is leten goon.
 
¶And al this hous, of whiche I rede,
Was made of twigges, falwe,° rede,
And grene eek, and som were white,
Swiche as men to these cages thwite,°
Or maken of these paniers,°
Or elles hottes° or dossers;°
That, for the swough° and for the twigges,
This hous was also ful of gigges,°
And also ful eek of chirkinges,°
And of many other werkinges;
And eek this hous hath of entrees
As fele° as leves been on trees
In somer, whan they grene been;
And on the roof men may yit seen
A thousand holes, and wel mo,
To leten wel the soun out go.
And by day, in every tide,°
Ben al the dores opened wide,
And by night, echoon unshet;°
Ne porter ther is non to let°
No maner tidings in to pace;°
Ne never reste is in that place,
That it nis° fild ful of tidinges,
Other loude, or of whispringes;
And, over al the houses angles,°
Is ful of rouninges° and of jangles°
Of werres,° of pees, of mariages,
Of reste, of labour, of viages,°
Of abood,° of deeth, of life,
Of love, of hate, acorde, of strife,
Of loos,° of lore,° and of winninges,
Of hele,° of sekenesse, of bildinges,
Of faire windes, and of tempestes,
Of qualme° of folk, and eek of bestes;
Of divers transmutaciouns°
Of estats, and eek of regiouns;
Of trust, of drede, of jelousie,
Of wit, of winninge, of folie;
Of plentee, and of greet famine,
Of chepe,° of derth,° and of ruine;
Of good or mis governement,
Of fir, of divers accident.
And lo, this hous, of whiche I write,
Siker be ye, it nas not lite;°
For it was sixty mile of lengthe;
Al° was the timber of no strengthe,
Yet it is founded° to endure
Whil that it list to aventure,°
That is the moder of tidinges,
As the see of welles and springes,—
And it was shapen lik a cage.
“Certes,” quod I, “in al min age,
Ne saugh I swich a hous as this.”
 
¶And as I wondred me,° ywis,
Upon this hous, tho war was I
How that min egle, faste by,
Was perched hie upon a stoon;
And I gan streighte to him goon,
And seide thus: “I preye thee
That thou a whil abide° me
For Goddes love, and let me seen
What wondres in this place been;
For yit, peraunter,° I may lere°
Som good theron, or sumwhat here
That leef° me were, or that I wente.”
“Peter! that is min entente,”
Quod he to me; “therfor I dwelle;°
But certein, oon thing I thee telle,
That, but° I bringe thee therinne,
Ne shalt thou never cunne ginne°
To come into it, out of doute,
So faste it whirleth, lo, aboute.
But sith that Joves, of his grace,
As I have seid, wol thee solace
Finally with these thinges,
Uncouthe° sightes and tidinges,
To passe° with thin hevinesse;°
Suche routhe° hath he of thy distresse,
That thou suffrest debonairly°—
And wost° thyselven utterly
Disesperat° of alle blis,
Sith that Fortune hath maad amis°
The fruit° of al thin hertes reste
Languisshe° and eek in point to breste°—
That he, through his mighty merite,
Wol do thee ese,° al be it lite,
And yaf expres° commaundement,
To whiche I am obedient,
To furthre thee° with al my might,
And wisse° and teche thee aright
Wher thou maist most tidinges here;
Shaltow° anoon heer many lere.”°
 
¶With this worde he, right anoon,
Hent° me up bitwene his toon,°
And at a windowe in me broghte,
That in this hous was, as me thoghte°—
And therwithal, me thoughte it stente,°
And nothing it aboute wente—
And me sette in the flore adoun.
But which° a congregacioun
Of folk, as I saugh rome aboute
Som within and som withoute,
Nas never seen, ne shal ben eft;°
That, certes, in the world nis left
So many formed by Nature,
Ne deed° so many a creature;
That wel unnethe,° in that place,
Hadde I a foote-brede° of space;
And every wight° that I saugh there
Rouned° ech in others ere
A newe tiding prevely,
Or elles tolde al openly
Right thus, and seide: “Nost° not thou
That is betid,° lo late° or now?”
“No,” quod the other, “tel me what”;—
And than he tolde him this and that,
And swoor therto that it was sooth—
“Thus hath he seid,”—and “Thus he dooth”—
“Thus shal it be,”—“Thus herde I seye”—
“That shal be found, that dar I leye”°:—
That al the folk that is alive
Ne han the cunning to discrive°
The thinges that I herde there,
What aloude, and what in ere.
 
¶But al the wondermost° was this:—
Whan oon had herd a thing, ywis,
He com forth to another wight,
And gan him tellen, anoonright,
The same that to him was ytolde,
Or it a furlong°-way was olde,
But gan somwhat for to eche°
To this tiding in this speche
More than ever it spoken was.
And nat so sone departed nas
That he fro him, that he ne mette
With the thridde; and, er he lette°
Any stounde,° he tolde him als;°
Were the tiding sooth or fals,
Yit wolde he telle it nathelees,
And evermo with more encrees°
Than it was erst. Thus north and southe
Went every word fro mouth to mouthe,
And that encresing evermo,
As fir is wont to quikke° and go
From a sparke spronge amis,
Til al a citee brent up is.
And whan that was ful yspronge,°
And woxen° more on every tonge
Than ever it was, it wente anoon
Up to a windowe, out to goon;
Or, but° it mighte out ther pace,
Hit gan out crepe at som crevace,°
And fleigh forth faste for the nones.
And somtime saugh I tho, at ones,
A lesing° and a sad sothsawe,°
That gonne of aventure drawe°
Out at a windowe for to pace.
 
¶And, when they metten in that place,
They were achekked° bothe two,
And neither of hem moste out go;
For other° so they gonne croude,°
Til eche of hem gan cryen loude,
“Lat me go first!”—“Nay, but let me!
And here I wol ensuren° thee
With the nones that thou do so,
That I shal never fro thee go,
But be thin owne sworen brother!
We wil medle° us ech with other,
That no man, be he never so° wrothe,
Shal han that oon of two, but bothe
At ones, al beside his leve,°
Come we amorwe or on eve,
Be we cried or stille yrouned.”°
 
¶Thus saugh I fals and sooth compouned°
Togeder flee for oo tidinge.°
Thus out at holes gonne wringe°
Every tiding streight to Fame;
And she gan yeven° eche his name,
After hir disposicioun,°
And yaf hem eek duracioun,
Som to wexe and wane° sone,
As dooth the faire, white mone,
And leet hem gon. Ther might I seen
Winged wondres faste fleen,°
Twenty thousand in a route,°
As Eolus hem blew aboute.
 
¶And, Lord! this hous, in alle times,
Was ful of shipmen and pilgrimes,
With scrippes bretful of lesinges,°
Entremedled° with tidinges,
And eek alone by hemselve.
O, many a thousand times twelve
Saugh I eek of these pardoneres,
Currours,° and eek messangeres,
With boistes° crammed ful of lies
As ever vessel was with lies.°
And as I altherfastest° wente
Aboute, and dide al min entente
Me for to pleye and for to lere,
And eek a tiding for to here,
That I had herd of som contree
That shal not now be told for me;—
For it no nede is, redely;
Folk can singe it bet than I;
For al mot out, other late or rathe,°
Al the sheves in the lathe;°—
I herde a grete noise withalle
In a corner of the halle,
Ther men of love tidings tolde,
And I gan thiderward beholde;
For I saugh renninge every wight,
As faste as that they hadden might;
And everich cried, “What thing is that?”
And som seide, “I not never what,”
And whan they were alle on an hepe,°
Tho° behinde gonne up lepe,°
And clamben° up on other faste,
And up the nose and yën° caste,
And troden faste on othere heles,
And stampe, as men don after eles.°
 
¶Atte laste I saugh a man,
Whiche that I nat ne can;°
But he semed for to be
A man of greet auctoritee …
