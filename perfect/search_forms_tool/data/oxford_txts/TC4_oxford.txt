But al to litel, weylawey the while,
Lasteth swich joye, ythonked be Fortune!
That semeth trewest, whan she wol bigile,
And can to foles so hir song entune,
That she hem hent and blent, traitour comune;
And whan a wight is from hir wheel ythrowe,
Than laugheth she, and maketh him the mowe.
From Troilus she gan hir brighte face
Awey to writhe, and took of him non hede,
But caste him clene oute of his lady grace,
And on hir wheel she sette up Diomede;
For which right now min herte ginneth blede,
And now my penne, allas! with which I write,
Quaketh for drede of that I moot endite.
For how Criseyde Troilus forsook,
Or at the leste, how that she was unkinde,
Mot hennesforth ben matere of my book,
As writen folk thorugh which it is in minde.
Allas! that they shulde ever cause finde
To speke hir harm; and if they on hir lie,
Ywis, hemself sholde han the vilanie.
O ye Herines, Nightes doughtren three,
That endelees compleinen ever in pine,
Megera, Alete, and eek Thesiphone;
Thou cruel Mars eek, fader to Quirine,
This ilke ferthe book me helpeth fine,
So that the los of lif and love yfere
Of Troilus be fully shewed here.
Ligginge in ost, as I have seid er this,
The Grekes stronge, aboute Troye toun,
Bifel that, whan that Phebus shining is
Upon the brest of Hercules Lioun,
That Ector, with ful many a bold baroun,
Caste on a day with Grekes for to fighte,
As he was wont to greve hem what he mighte.
Not I how longe or short it was bitwene
This purpos and that day they fighten mente;
But on a day wel armed, bright and shene,
Ector, and many a worthy wight out wente,
With spere in hond and bigge bowes bente;
And in the berd, withoute lenger lette,
Hir fomen in the feld anoon hem mette.
The longe day, with speres sharpe ygrounde,
With arwes, dartes, swerdes, maces felle,
They fighte and bringen hors and man to grounde,
And with hir axes out the braines quelle.
But in the laste shour, sooth for to telle,
The folk of Troye hemselven so misledden,
That with the worse at night homward they fledden.
At whiche day was taken Antenor,
Maugre Polydamas or Monesteo,
Santippe, Sarpedon, Polynestor,
Polite, or eek the Troian daun Ripheo,
And othere lasse folk, as Phebuseo.
So that, for harm, that day the folk of Troye
Dredden to lese a greet part of hir joye.
Of Priamus was yeve, at Greek requeste,
A time of trewe, and tho they gonnen trete,
Hir prisoneres to chaungen, moste and leste,
And for the surplus yeven sommes grete.
This thing anoon was couth in every strete,
Bothe in th’assege, in toune, and everywhere,
And with the firste it cam to Calkas ere.
Whan Calkas knew this tretis sholde holde,
In consistorie, among the Grekes, sone
He gan in thringe forth, with lordes olde,
And sette him there, as he was wont to done;
And with a chaunged face hem bad a bone,
For love of God, to don that reverence,
To stinte noise, and yeve him audience.
Thanne seide he thus, “Lo! lordes mine, I was
Troyan, as it is knowen out of drede;
And if that yow remembre, I am Calkas,
That alderfirst yaf comfort to your nede,
And tolde wel how that ye sholden spede.
For dredelees, thorugh yow shal in a stounde
Ben Troye ybrend, and beten doun to grounde.
“And in what forme, or in what maner wise
This town to shende, and al your lust t’acheve,
Ye han er this wel herd it me devise;
This knowe ye, my lordes, as I leve.
And for the Grekes weren me so leve,
I com myself in my propre persone,
To teche in this how yow was best to done;
“Havinge unto my tresour ne my rente
Right no resport, to respect of your ese.
Thus al my good I loste and to yow wente,
Wening in this, my lordis, yow to plese.
But al that los ne doth me no disese.
I vouchesauf, as wisly have I joye,
For you to lese al that I have in Troye,
“Save of a doughter, that I lafte, allas!
Slepinge at hoom, whanne out of Troye I sterte.
O sterne, O cruel fader that I was!
How mighte I have in that so hard an herte?
Allas! I ne hadde ybrought hir in hir sherte!
For sorwe of which I wol not live to morwe,
But if ye lordes rewe upon my sorwe.
“For, by that cause I say no time er now
Hir to delivere, I holden have my pees;
But now or never, if that it like yow,
I may hir have right soone, doutelees.
O help and grace! amonges al this prees,
Rewe on this olde caitif in destresse,
Sin I through yow have al this hevinesse!
“Ye have now caught and fetered in prisoun
Troians ynowe; and if your willes be,
My child with oon may have redempcioun.
Now for the love of God and of bountee,
Oon of so fele, allas! so yeve him me.
What nede were it this preyere for to werne,
Sin ye shul bothe han folk and toun as yerne?
“On peril of my lif, I shal not lie,
Appollo hath me told it feithfully,
I have eek founde it by astronomie,
By sort, and by augurie eek trewely,
And dar wel seye, the time is faste by,
That fir and flaumbe on al the toun shal sprede;
And thus shal Troye turne in asshen dede.
“For certein, Phebus and Neptunus bothe,
That makeden the walles of the toun,
Ben with the folk of Troye alwey so wrothe,
That thei wol bringe it to confusioun,
Right in despit of king Lameadoun.
Bicause he nolde payen hem hir hire,
The toun of Troye shal ben set onfire.”
Telling his tale alwey, this olde greye,
Humble in speche, and in his lokinge eke,
The salte teres from his eyën tweye
Ful faste ronnen doun by either cheke.
So longe he gan of socour hem biseke
That, for to hele him of his sikes sore,
They yave him Antenor, withoute more.
But who was glad ynough but Calkas tho?
And of this thing ful soone his nedes leide
On hem that sholden for the tretis go,
And hem for Antenor ful ofte preide
To bringen hoom king Toas and Criseyde;
And whan Priam his savegarde sente,
Th’embassadours to Troye streight they wente.
The cause ytold of hir coming, the olde
Priam the king ful sone in general
Let hereupon his parlement to holde,
Of which th’effect rehersen yow I shal.
Th’embassadours ben answered for final,
Th’eschaunge of prisoners and al this nede
Hem liketh wel, and forth in they procede.
This Troilus was present in the place,
Whan axed was for Antenor Criseyde,
For which ful soone chaungen gan his face,
As he that with tho wordes wel neigh deide.
But nathelees, he no word to it seide,
Lest men sholde his affeccioun espie;
With mannes herte he gan his sorwes drie.
And ful of anguish and of grisly drede
Abood what lordes wolde unto it seye;
And if they wolde graunte, as God forbede,
Th’eschaunge of hir, than thoughte he thinges tweye,
First, how to save hir honour, and what weye
He mighte best th’eschaunge of hir withstonde;
Ful faste he cast how al this mighte stonde.
Love him made al prest to doon hir bide,
And rather dye than she sholde go;
But resoun seide him, on that other side,
Withoute assent of hir ne do not so,
Lest for thi werk she wolde be thy fo,
And seyn, that “Thorugh thy medling is yblowe
Your bother love, there it was erst unknowe.”
For which he gan deliberen, for the beste,
That though the lordes wolde that she wente,
He wolde late hem graunte what hem leste,
And telle his lady first what that they mente.
And whan that she had seid him hir entente,
Therafter wolde he werken also blive,
Though al the world ayein it wolde strive.
Ector, which that wel the Grekes herde,
For Antenor how they wolde han Criseyde,
Gan it withstonde, and sobrely answerde:—
“Sires, she nis no prisoner,” he seide;
“I noot on yow who that this charge leide,
But, on my part, ye may eftsone him telle,
We usen here no wommen for to selle.”
The noise of peple upstirte thanne at ones,
As breme as blase of straw yset on fire;
For infortune it wolde, for the nones,
They sholden hir confusioun desire.
“Ector,” quod they, “what goost may yow enspire,
This womman thus to shilde and doon us lese
Daun Antenor?—a wrong wey now ye chese—
“That is so wis, and eek so bold baroun,
And we han nede of folk, as men may see;
He is eek oon the grettest of this toun;
O Ector, lat tho fantasyës be!
O king Priam,” quod they, “thus seggen we,
That al our vois is to forgon Criseyde”;
And to deliveren Antenor they preide.
O Juvenal, Lord! trewe is thy sentence,
That litel witen folk what is to yerne
That they ne finde in hir desir offence;
For cloud of errour lat hem not descerne
What best is; and lo, here ensample as yerne.
This folk desiren now deliveraunce
Of Antenor, that broughte hem to mischaunce!
For he was after traitour to the toun
Of Troye; allas! they quitte him out to rathe;
O nice world, lo, thy discrecioun!
Criseyde, which that never dide hem skathe,
Shal now no lenger in hir blisse bathe;
But Antenor, he shal com hoom to toune,
And she shal out; thus seiden here and howne.
For which delibered was by parlement,
For Antenor to yelden up Criseyde,
And it pronounced by the president,
Altheigh that Ector “Nay” ful ofte preide.
And finaly, what wight that it withseide,
It was for nought, it moste been, and sholde;
For substaunce of the parlement it wolde.
Departed out of parlement echone,
This Troilus, withoute wordes mo,
Unto his chaumbre spedde him faste allone,
But if it were a man of his or two,
The whiche he bad out faste for to go,
Bicause he wolde slepen, as he seide,
And hastely upon his bed him leide.
And as in winter leves been biraft,
Eche after other, til the tree be bare,
So that ther nis but bark and braunche ylaft,
Lith Troilus, biraft of ech welfare,
Ybounden in the blake bark of care,
Disposed wood out of his wit to breide,
So sore him sat the chaunginge of Criseyde.
He rist him up, and every dore he shette
And windowe eek, and tho this sorweful man
Upon his beddes side adoun him sette,
Ful lik a deed image pale and wan;
And in his brest the heped wo bigan
Outbreste, and he to werken in this wise
In his woodnesse, as I shal yow devise.
Right as the wilde bole biginneth springe
Now here, now there, ydarted to the herte,
And of his deeth roreth in compleininge,
Right so gan he about the chaumbre sterte,
Smiting his brest ay with his fistes smerte;
His heed to the wal, his body to the grounde
Ful ofte he swapte, himselven to confounde.
His eyen two, for pitee of his herte,
Out stremeden as swifte welles tweye;
The heighe sobbis of his sorwes smerte
His speche him rafte, unnethes mighte he seye,
“O deeth, allas! why niltow do me deye?
Acursed be the day which that nature
Shoop me to ben a lives creature!”
But after, whan the furie and the rage
Which that his herte twiste and faste threste,
By lengthe of time somwhat gan asswage,
Upon his bed he leide him doun to reste;
But tho bigonne his teres more outbreste,
That wondir is, the body may suffise
To half this wo, which that I yow devise.
Than seide he thus, “Fortune! allas the while!
What have I doon, what have I thus agilt?
How mightestow for reuthe me bigile?
Is ther no grace, and shal I thus be spilt?
Shal thus Criseyde awey, for that thou wilt?
Allas! how maystow in thin herte finde
To been to me thus cruel and unkinde?
“Have I thee nought honoured al my live,
As thou wel wost, above the goddes alle?
Why wiltow me fro joye thus deprive?
O Troilus, what may men now thee calle
But wrecche of wrecches, out of honour falle
Into miserie, in which I wol biwaile
Criseyde, allas! til that the breeth me faile?
“Allas, Fortune! if that my lif in joye
Displesed hadde unto thy foule envie,
Why ne haddestow my fader, king of Troye,
Biraft the lif, or doon my bretheren die,
Or slain myself, that thus compleine and crie,
I, combre-world, that may of nothing serve,
But ever die, and never fully sterve?
“If that Criseyde allone were me laft,
Nought roughte I whiderward thou woldest me stere;
And hir, allas! than hastow me biraft.
But ever more, lo! this is thy manere,
To reve a wight that most is to him dere,
To preve in that thy gerful violence.
Thus am I lost, ther helpeth no defence!
“O verray lord of love, O God, allas!
That knowest best min herte and al my thought,
What shal my sorwful lif don in this cas
If I forgo that I so dere have bought?
Sin ye Criseyde and me han fully brought
Into your grace, and bothe our hertes seled,
How may ye suffre, allas! it be repeled?
“What I may doon, I shal, whil I may dure
On live in torment and in cruel peine,
This infortune or this disaventure,
Allone as I was born, ywis, compleine;
Ne never wil I seen it shine or reine;
But ende I wil, as Edippe, in derknesse
My sorwful lif, and dyen in distresse.
“O wery goost, that errest to and fro,
Why niltow fleen out of the wofulleste
Body that ever mighte on grounde go?
O soule, lurkinge in this wo, unneste,
Flee forth out of min herte, and lat it breste,
And folwe alwey Criseyde, thy lady dere;
Thy righte place is now no lenger here!
“O wofulle eyen two, sin your disport
Was al to seen Criseydes eyen brighte,
What shal ye doon but, for my discomfort,
Stonden for nought, and wepen out your sighte?
Sin she is queint, that wont was yow to lighte,
In vein fro this forth have I eyen tweye
Yformed, sin your vertue is aweye.
“O my Criseyde, O lady sovereine
Of thilke woful soule that thus crieth,
Who shal now yeven comfort to the peine?
Allas, no wight; but when min herte dieth,
My spirit, which that so unto yow hieth,
Receive in gree, for that shal ay yow serve;
Forthy no fors is, though the body sterve.
“O ye loveres, that heighe upon the wheel
Ben set of Fortune, in good aventure,
God leve that ye finde ay love of steel,
And longe mot your lif in joye endure!
But whan ye comen by my sepulture,
Remembreth that your felaw resteth there;
For I lovede eek, though I unworthy were.
“O olde unholsom and mislived man,
Calkas I mene, allas! what eileth thee
To been a Greek, sin thou art born Troian?
O Calkas, which that wilt my bane be,
In cursed time was thou born for me!
As wolde blisful Jove, for his joye,
That I thee hadde, where I wolde, in Troye!”
A thousand sikes, hottere than the glede,
Out of his brest ech after other wente,
Medled with pleintes newe, his wo to fede,
For which his woful teres never stente;
And shortly, so his peines him torente,
And wex so mat, that joye nor penaunce
He feleth noon, but lith forth in a traunce.
Pandare, which that in the parlement
Had herd what every lord and burgeis seide,
And how ful graunted was, by oon assent,
For Antenor to yelden so Criseyde,
Gan wel neigh wood out of his wit to breide,
So that, for wo, he niste what he mente;
But in a rees to Troilus he wente.
A certein knight, that for the time kepte
The chaumbre dore, undide it him anoon;
And Pandare, that ful tendreliche wepte,
Into the derke chaumbre, as stille as stoon,
Toward the bed gan softely to goon,
So confus, that he niste what to seye;
For verray wo his wit was neigh aweye.
And with his chere and loking al totorn,
For sorwe of this, and with his armes folden,
He stood this woful Troilus biforn,
And on his pitous face he gan biholden;
But Lord, so often gan his herte colden,
Seing his freend in wo, whos hevinesse
His herte slow, as thoughte him, for distresse.
This woful wight, this Troilus, that felte
His freend Pandare ycomen him to see,
Gan as the snow ayein the sonne melte,
For which this sorwful Pandare, of pitee,
Gan for to wepe as tendreliche as he;
And specheles thus been thise ilke tweie,
That neither mighte o word for sorwe seye.
But at the laste this woful Troilus,
Ney deed for smert, gan bresten out to rore,
And with a sorwful noise he seide thus,
Among his sobbes and his sikes sore,
“Lo! Pandare, I am deed, withouten more.
Hastow nought herd at parlement,” he seide,
“For Antenor how lost is my Criseyde?”
This Pandarus, ful deed and pale of hewe,
Ful pitously answerde and seide, “Yis!
As wisly were it fals as it is trewe,
That I have herd, and wot al how it is.
O mercy, God, who wolde have trowed this?
Who wolde have wend that, in so litel a throwe,
Fortune our joye wolde han overthrowe?
“For in this world ther is no creature,
As to my doom, that ever saw ruine
Straunger than this, thorugh cas or aventure.
But who may al eschewe or al devine?
Swich is this world; forthy I thus define,
Ne trust no wight to finden in Fortune
Ay propretee; hir yeftes been comune.
“But tel me this, why thou art now so mad
To sorwen thus? Why listow in this wise,
Sin thy desir al holly hastow had,
So that, by right, it oughte ynow suffise?
But I, that never felte in my servise
A frendly chere or loking of an yë,
Lat me thus wepe and waile, til I die.
“And over al this, as thou wel wost thyselve,
This town is ful of ladies al aboute;
And, to my doom, fairer than swiche twelve
As ever she was, shal I finde, in som route
Ye, oon or two, withouten any doute.
Forthi be glad, min owene dere brother,
If she be lost, we shul recovere another.
“What, God forbede alwey that ech plesaunce
In o thing were, and in non other wight!
If oon can singe, another can wel daunce;
If this be goodly, she is glad and light;
And this is fair, and that can good aright.
Ech for his vertu holden is for dere,
Both heroner and faucon for rivere.
“And eek, as writ Zanzis, that was ful wis,
‘The newe love out chaceth oft the olde’;
And upon newe cas lith newe avis.
Thenk eek, thyself to saven artow holde;
Swich fir, by proces, shal of kinde colde.
For sin it is but casuel plesaunce,
Som cas shal putte it out of remembraunce.
“For also seur as day comth after night,
The newe love, labour or other wo,
Or elles selde seinge of a wight,
Don olde affecciouns alle overgo.
And, for thy part, thou shalt have oon of tho
To abrigge with thy bittre peines smerte;
Absence of hir shal drive hir out of herte.”
Thise wordes seide he for the nones alle,
To helpe his freend, lest he for sorwe deide.
For doutelees, to doon his wo to falle,
He roughte not what unthrift that he seide.
But Troilus, that neigh for sorwe deide,
Tok litel hede of al that ever he mente;
Oon ere it herde, at other out it wente—
But at the laste he answerde and seid, “Freend,
This lechecraft, or heled thus to be,
Were wel sitting, if that I were a feend,
To traisen hir that trewe is unto me!
I pray God, lat this consail never ythee;
But do me rather sterve anonright here
Er I thus do as thou me woldest lere.
“She that I serve, ywis, what so thou seye,
To whom min herte enhabit is by right,
Shal han me holly hires til that I deie.
For, Pandarus, sin I have trouthe hir hight,
I wol not been untrewe for no wight;
But as hir man I wol ay live and sterve,
And never other creature serve.
“And ther thou seyst, thou shalt as faire finde
As she, lat be, make no comparisoun
To creature yformed here by kinde.
O leve Pandare, in conclusioun,
I wol not be of thin opinioun,
Touching al this; for whiche I thee biseche,
To hold thy pees; thou sleest me with thy speche.
“Thow biddest me I sholde love another
Al freshly newe, and lat Criseyde go!
It lith not in my power, leve brother.
And though I mighte, I wolde not do so.
But canstow pleyen raket, to and fro,
Netle in, dokke out, now this, now that, Pandare?
Now foule falle hir, that for thy wo hath care!
“Thow farest eek by me, thou Pandarus,
As he, that whan a wight is wo bigoon,
He cometh to him a pas, and seith right thus,
‘Thenk not on smert, and thou shalt fele noon.’
Thou most me first transmuwen in a stoon,
And reve me my passiounes alle,
Er thou so lightly do my wo to falle.
“The deeth may wel out of my brest departe
The lif, so longe may this sorwe mine;
But fro my soule shal Criseydes darte
Out never mo; but doun with Proserpine,
Whan I am deed, I wol go wone in pine;
And ther I wol eternally compleine
My wo, and how that twinned be we tweine.
“Thow hast here maad an argument, for fin,
How that it sholde lasse peine be
Criseyde to forgoon, for she was min,
And live in ese and in felicitee.
Why gabbestow, that seidest thus to me
That ‘Him is wors that is fro wele ythrowe,
Than he hadde erst non of that wele yknowe?’
“But tel me now, sin that thee thinketh so light
To chaungen so in love, ay to and fro,
Why hastow not don bisily thy might
To chaungen hir that doth thee al thy wo?
Why niltow lete hir fro thin herte go?
Why niltow love another lady swete,
That may thin herte setten in quiete?
“If thou hast had in love ay yet mischaunce,
And canst it not out of thin herte drive,
I, that livede in lust and in plesaunce
With hir as muche as creature on live,
How sholde I that foryete, and that so blive?
O where hastow ben hid so longe in muwe,
That canst so wel and formely arguwe?
“Nay nay God wot, nought worth is al thy reed,
For which, for what that ever may bifalle,
Withouten wordes mo, I wol be deed.
O deeth, that endere art of sorwes alle,
Com now, sin I so ofte after thee calle,
For sely is that deeth, soth for to seyne,
That, ofte ycleped, cometh and endeth peine.
“Wel wot I, whil my lif was in quiete,
Er thou me slowe, I wolde have yeven hire;
But now thy cominge is to me so swete,
That in this world I nothing so desire.
O deeth, sin with this sorwe I am afire,
Thou outher do me anoon in teres drenche,
Or with thy colde strook min hete quenche!
“Sin that thou sleest so fele in sondry wise
Ayens hir wil, unpreyed, day and night,
Do me, at my requeste, this servise,
Deliver now the world, so dostow right,
Of me, that am the wofulleste wight
That ever was; for time is that I sterve,
Sin in this world of right nought may I serve.”
This Troilus in teres gan distille,
As licour out of a lambek ful faste;
And Pandarus gan holde his tunge stille,
And to the ground his eyen doun he caste.
But nathelees, thus thoughte he at the laste,
“What, parde, rather than my felaw deie,
Yet shal I somwhat more unto him seye”:
And seide, “Freend, sin thou hast swich distresse,
And sin thee list min arguments to blame,
Why nilt thyselven helpen doon redresse,
And with thy manhod letten al this grame?
Go ravisshe hir ne canstow not for shame?
And outher lat hir out of toune fare,
Or hold hir stille, and leve thy nice fare.
“Artow in Troye, and hast non hardiment
To take a womman which that loveth thee,
And wolde hirselven been of thin assent?
Now is not this a nice vanitee?
Ris up anoon, and lat this weping be,
And kith thou art a man, for in this houre
I wil be deed, or she shal bleven oure.”
To this answerde him Troilus ful softe,
And seide, “Parde, leve brother dere,
Al this have I myself yet thought ful ofte,
And more thing than thou devisest here.
But why this thing is laft, thou shalt wel here;
And whan thou me hast yeve an audience,
Therafter mayst thou telle al thy sentence.
“First, sin thou wost this toun hath al this werre
For ravisshing of wommen so by might,
It sholde not be suffred me to erre,
As it stant now, ne doon so gret unright.
I sholde han also blame of every wight,
My fadres graunt if that I so withstode,
Sin she is chaunged for the tounes goode.
“I have eek thought, so it were hir assent,
To aske hir at my fader, of his grace;
Than thenke I, this were hir accusement,
Sin wel I woot I may hir not purchace.
For sin my fader, in so heigh a place
As parlement, hath hir eschaunge enseled,
He nil for me his lettre be repeled.
“Yet drede I most hir herte to pertourbe
With violence, if I do swich a game;
For if I wolde it openly distourbe,
It moste been disclaundre to hir name.
And me were lever deed than hir defame,
As nolde God but if I sholde have
Hir honour lever than my lif to save!
Thus am I lost, for ought that I can see;
For certein is, sin that I am hir knight,
I moste hire honour levere han than me
In every cas, as lovere oughte of right.
Thus am I with desir and reson twight;
Desir for to distourben hir me redeth,
And reson nil not, so min herte dredeth.”
Thus weping that he coude never cesse,
He seide, “Allas! how shal I, wrecche, fare?
For wel fele I alwey my love encresse,
And hope is lasse and lasse alwey, Pandare!
Encressen eek the causes of my care;
So welawey, why nil min herte breste?
For, as in love, ther is but litel reste.”
Pandare answerde, “Freend, thou mayst, for me,
Don as thee list; but hadde ich it so hote,
And thin estat, she sholde go with me;
Though al this toun criede on this thing by note,
I nolde sette at al that noise a grote.
For when men han wel cried, than wol they roune;
A wonder last but nine night never in toune.
“Devine not in reson ay so depe
Ne preciously, but help thyself anoon;
Bet is that othere than thyselven wepe,
And namely, sin ye two been al oon.
Ris up, for by min heed, she shal not goon;
And rather be in blame a lite yfounde
Than sterve here as a gnat, withoute wounde.
“It is no rape, in my dom, ne no vice
Hir to withholden, that ye loveth most.
Paraunter, she might holden thee for nice
To lete hir go thus to the Grekes ost.
Thenk eek Fortune, as wel thyselven wost,
Helpeth hardy men to his emprise,
And weiveth wrecches, for hir cowardise.
“And though thy lady wolde a lite hir greve,
Thou shalt thy pees ful wel hereafter make,
But as for me, certain, I can not leve
That she wolde it as now for ivel take.
Why sholde than for ferd thin herte quake?
Thenk eek how Paris hath, that is thy brother,
A love; and why shaltow not have another?
“And Troilus, o thing I dar thee swere,
That if Criseyde, which that is thy leef,
Now loveth thee as wel as thou dost here,
God help me so, she nil not take agreef,
Though thou do bote anoon in this mischeef.
And if she wilneth fro thee for to passe,
Thanne is she fals; so love hir wel the lasse.
“Forthi tak herte, and thenk, right as a knight,
Thourgh love is broken alday every lawe.
Kith now sumwhat thy corage and thy might,
Have mercy on thyself, for any awe.
Lat not this wrecched wo thin herte gnawe,
But manly set the world on sixe and sevene;
And, if thou deie a martir, go to hevene.
“I wol myself be with thee at this dede,
Though ich and al my kin, upon a stounde,
Shulle in a strete as dogges liggen dede,
Thourgh girt with many a wide and blody wounde.
In every cas I wol a freend be founde.
And if thee list here sterven as a wrecche,
Adieu, the devel spede him that it recche!”
This Troilus gan with tho wordes quiken,
And seide, “Freend, graunt mercy, ich assente;
But certainly thou mayst not me so priken,
Ne peine noon ne may me so tormente,
That, for no cas, it is not min entente,
At shorte wordes, though I dyen sholde,
To ravisshe hir, but if hirself it wolde.”
Pandare answerde “Of that be as be may,
But tel me than, hastow hir wel assaied,
That sorwest thus?” And he answerde him “Nay.”
“Wherof artow,” quod Pandare, “than amaied,
That nost not that she wol ben ivel apaied
To ravisshe hir, sin thou hast not ben there,
But if that Jove tolde it in thin ere?
“Forthi ris up, as nought ne were, anoon,
And wash thy face, and to the king thou wende,
Or he may wondren whider thou art goon.
Thou most with wisdom him and othere blende;
Or, upon cas, he may after thee sende
Er thou be war; and shortly, brother dere,
Be glad, and lat me werke in this matere.
“For I shal shape it so, that sikerly
Thou shalt this night som time, in som manere,
Com speke with thy lady prevely,
And by hir wordes eek, and by hir chere,
Thou shalt ful sone aparceive and wel here
Al hir entente, and in this cas the beste;
And fare now wel, for in this point I reste.”
The swifte Fame, which that false thinges
Egal reporteth lik the thinges trewe,
Was thorughout Troye yfled with preste winges
Fro man to man, and made this tale al newe,
How Calkas doughter, with hir brighte hewe,
At parlement, withoute wordes more,
Ygraunted was in chaunge of Antenore.
The whiche tale anoonright as Criseyde
Had herd, she which that of hir fader roughte,
As in this cas, right nought, ne whanne he deide,
Ful bisily to Juppiter bisoughte
Yeve him mischaunce that this tretis broughte.
But shortly, lest thise tales sothe were,
She dorste at no wight asken it, for fere.
As she that hadde hir herte and al hir minde
On Troilus yset so wonder faste,
That al this world ne mighte hir love unbinde,
Ne Troilus out of hir herte caste,
She wol ben his, whil that hir lif may laste.
And thus she brenneth bothe in love and drede,
So that she niste what beste was to rede.
But as men seen in toune, and al aboute,
That wommen usen frendes to visite,
So to Criseyde of wommen com a route
For pitous joye, and wenden hir delite;
And with hir tales, dere ynough a mite,
These wommen, which that in the cite dwelle,
They sette hem doun, and seide as I shal telle.
Quod first that oon, “I am glad, trewely,
Bicause of yow, that shal your fader see.”
Another seide, “Ywis, so nam not I;
For al to litel hath she with us be.”
Quod tho the thridde, “I hope, ywis, that she
Shal bringen us the pees on every side,
That, whan she gooth, almighty God hir gide!”
Tho wordes and tho wommannisshe thinges,
She herde hem right as though she thennes were;
For, God it wot, hir herte on other thing is,
Although the body sat among hem there.
Hir advertence is alwey elleswhere;
For Troilus ful faste hir soule soughte;
Withouten word, alwey on him she thoughte.
Thise wommen, that thus wenden hir to plese,
Aboute nought gonne alle hir tales spende;
Swich vanitee ne can don hir non ese,
As she that, al this mene while, brende
Of other passioun than that they wende,
So that she felte almost hir herte deie
For wo, and wery of that companie.
For which no lenger mighte she restreine
Hir teres, so they gonnen up to welle,
That yeven signes of the bitter peine
In whiche hir spirit was, and moste dwelle,
Remembring hir, fro heven unto which helle
She fallen was, sith she forgoth the sighte
Of Troilus, and sorowfully she sighte.
And thilke foles sittinge hir aboute
Wenden, that she wepte and siked sore
Bicause that she sholde out of that route
Departe, and never pleye with hem more.
And they that hadde yknowen hir of yore
Seye hir so wepe, and thoughte it kindenesse,
And eche of hem wepte eek for hir distresse;
And bisily they gonnen hir conforten
Of thing, God wot, on which she litel thoughte;
And with hir tales wenden hir disporten,
And to be glad they often hir bisoughte.
But swich an ese therwith they hir wroughte
Right as a man is esed for to fele,
For ache of heed, to clawen him on his hele!
But after al this nice vanitee
They took hir leve, and hoom they wenten alle.
Criseyde, ful of sorweful pitee,
Into hir chaumbre up wente out of the halle,
And on hir bed she gan for deed to falle,
In purpos never thennes for to rise;
And thus she wroughte, as I shal yow devise.
Hir ounded heer, that sonnish was of hewe,
She rente, and eek hir fingres longe and smale
She wrong ful ofte, and bad God on hir rewe,
And with the deeth to doon bote on hir bale.
Hir hewe, whilom bright, that tho was pale,
Bar witnes of hir wo and hir constreinte;
And thus she spak, sobbinge, in hir compleinte:
“Alas!” quod she, “out of this regioun
I, woful wrecche and infortuned wight,
And born in corsed constellacioun,
Mot goon, and thus departen fro my knight;
Wo worth, allas! that ilke dayes light
On which I saw him first with eyen tweine,
That causeth me, and I him, al this peine!”
Therwith the teres from hir eyen two
Doun fille, as shour in Aperill, ful swithe;
Hir white brest she bet, and for the wo
After the deeth she cried a thousand sithe,
Sin he that wont hir wo was for to lithe,
She mot forgoon; for which disaventure
She held hirself a forlost creature.
She seid, “How shal he doon, and Ich also?
How sholde I live, if that I from him twinne?
O dere herte eek, that I love so,
Who shal that sorwe sleen that ye ben inne?
O Calkas, fader, thin be al this sinne!
O moder min, that cleped were Argive,
Wo worth that day that thou me bere on live!
To what fin sholde I live and sorwen thus?
How sholde a fish withoute water dure?
What is Criseyde worth, from Troilus?
How sholde a plaunte or lives creature
Live, withoute his kinde noriture?
For which ful oft a byword here I seye,
That, ‘Rotelees, mot grene soone deie.’
“I shal don thus, sin neither swerd ne darte
Dar I non handle, for the crueltee,
That ilke day that I from yow departe,
If sorwe of that nil not my bane be,
Than shal no mete or drinke come in me
Til I my soule out of my breste unshethe;
And thus myselven wol I do to dethe.
“And, Troilus, my clothes everichoon
Shul blake been, in tokening, herte swete,
That I am as out of this world agoon,
That wont was yow to setten in quiete;
And of min ordre, ay til deeth me mete,
The observaunce ever, in your absence,
Shal sorwe been, compleinte, and abstinence.
“Min herte and eek the woful goost therinne
Biquethe I, with your spirit to compleine
Eternally, for they shul never twinne.
For though in erthe ytwinned be we tweine,
Yet in the feld of pitee, out of peine,
That hight Elysos, shul we been yfere,
As Orpheus and Erudice his fere.
“Thus herte min, for Antenor, allas!
I soone shal be chaunged, as I wene.
But how shul ye don in this sorwful cas,
How shal your tendre herte this sustene?
But herte min, foryet this sorwe and tene,
And me also; for, soothly for to seye,
So ye wel fare, I recche not to deie.”
How mighte it ever yred ben or ysonge,
The pleinte that she made in hir distresse?
I noot; but, as for me, my litel tonge,
If I discreven wolde hir hevinesse,
It sholde make hir sorwe seme lesse
Than that it was, and childishly deface
Hir heigh compleinte, and therfore I it pace.
Pandare, which that sent from Troilus
Was to Criseyde, as ye han herd devise,
That for the beste it was accorded thus,
And he ful glad to doon him that servise,
Unto Criseyde, in a ful secree wise,
Theras she lay in torment and in rage,
Com hir to telle al hoolly his message.
And fond that she hirselven gan to trete
Ful pitously; for with hir salte teres
Hir brest, hir face ybathed was ful wete;
The mighty tresses of hir sonnish heres,
Unbroiden, hangen al aboute hir eres
Which yaf him verray signal of martire
Of deeth, which that hire herte gan desire.
Whan she him saw, she gan for sorwe anoon
Hir tery face atwixe hir armes hide,
For which this Pandare is so wo bigoon,
That in the hous he mighte unnethe abide,
As he that pitee felte on every side.
For if Criseyde hadde erst compleined sore,
Tho gan she pleine a thousand times more.
And in hir aspre pleinte thus she seide,
“Pandare first of joyes mo than two
Was cause causinge unto me, Criseyde,
That now transmuwed been in cruel wo.
Wher shal I sey to yow ‘welcome’ or no,
That alderfirst me broughte unto servise
Of love, allas! that endeth in swich wise?
“Endeth than love in wo? Ye, or men lieth!
And alle worldly blisse, as thinketh me,
The ende of blisse ay sorwe it occupieth;
And whoso troweth not that it so be,
Lat him upon me, woful wrecche, ysee,
That myself hate, and ay my birthe acorse,
Felinge alwey, fro wikke I go to worse.
“Whoso me seeth, he seeth sorwe al at ones,
Peine, torment, pleinte, wo, distresse.
Out of my woful body harm ther noon is,
As anguish, langour, cruel bitternesse,
Anoy, smert, drede, fury, and eek siknesse.
I trowe, ywis, from heven teres reine,
For pitee of min aspre and cruel peine!”
“And thou, my suster, ful of discomfort,”
Quod Pandarus, “what thenkestow to do?
Why ne hastow to thyselven som resport,
Why woltow thus thyselve, allas, fordo?
Leef al this werk and tak now hede to
That I shal seyn, and herkne, of good entente,
This, which by me thy Troilus thee sente.”
Torned hir tho Criseyde, a wo makinge
So greet that it a deeth was for to see:—
“Allas!” quod she, “what wordes may ye bringe?
What wol my dere herte seyn to me,
Which that I drede never mo to see?
Wol he have pleinte or teres, er I wende?
I have ynowe, if he therafter sende!”
She was right swich to seen in hir visage
As is that wight that men on bere binde;
Hir face, lik of Paradis the image,
Was al ychaunged in another kinde.
The pleie, the laughter men were wont to finde
In hire, and eek hir joies everychone,
Ben fled, and thus lith now Criseyde allone.
Aboute hir eyen two a purpre ring
Bitrent, in sothfast tokninge of hir peine,
That to biholde it was a dedly thing,
For which Pandare mighte not restreine
The teres from his eyen for to reine.
But nathelees, as he best mighte, he seide
From Troilus thise wordes to Criseyde.
“Lo, nece, I trowe ye han herd al how
The king, with othere lordes, for the beste,
Hath mad eschaunge of Antenor and yow,
That cause is of this sorwe and this unreste.
But how this cas doth Troilus moleste,
That may non erthely mannes tonge seye;
For verray wo his wit is al aweye.
“For which we han so sorwed, he and I,
That into litel bothe it hadde us slawe;
But thurgh my conseil this day, finally,
He somwhat is fro weping now withdrawe.
And semeth me that he desireth fawe
With yow to been al night, for to devise
Remede in this, if ther were any wise.
This, short and pleine, th’effect of my message,
As ferforth as my wit can comprehende.
For ye, that been of torment in swich rage,
May to no long prologe as now entende;
And herupon ye may answere him sende.
And, for the love of God, my nece dere,
So leef this wo er Troilus be here.”
“Gret is my wo,” quod she, and sighte sore,
As she that feleth dedly sharp distresse;
“But yet to me his sorwe is muchel more,
That love him bet than he himself, I gesse.
Allas! for me hath he swich hevinesse?
Can he for me so pitously compleine?
Ywis, this sorwe doubleth al my peine.
“Grevous to me, God wot, is for to twinne,”
Quod she, “but yet it harder is to me
To seen that sorwe which that he is inne;
For wel wot I, it wol my bane be;
And deie I wol in certain,” tho quod she;
“But bidde him come, er deeth, that thus me threteth,
Drive out that goost, which in min herte beteth.”
Thise wordes seid, she on hir armes two
Fil gruf, and gan to wepe pitously.
Quod Pandarus, “Allas! why do ye so,
Sin wel ye wot the time is faste by,
That he shal come? Aris up hastely,
That he yow nat biwopen thus ne finde,
But ye wol han him wood out of his minde!
“For wiste he that ye ferde in this manere,
He wolde himselve slee; and if I wende
To han this fare, he sholde not come here
For al the good that Priam may despende.
For to what fin he wolde anoon pretende,
That knowe I wel; and forthi yet I seye,
So leef this sorwe, or platly he wol deie.
“And shapeth yow his sorwe for to abregge,
And nought encresse, leve nece swete;
Beth rather to him cause of flat than egge,
And with som wisdom ye his sorwes bete.
What helpeth it to wepen ful a strete,
Or though ye bothe in salte teres dreinte?
Bet is a time of cure ay than of pleinte.
I mene thus; whan I him hider bringe,
Sin ye ben wise, and bothe of oon assent,
So shapeth how distourbe your goinge,
Or come ayen, sone after ye be went.
Wommen ben wise in short avisement;
And lat sen how your wit shal now availe;
And what that I may helpe, it shal not faile.”
“Go,” quod Criseyde, “and uncle, trewely,
I shal don al my might, me to restreine
From weping in his sight, and bisily,
Him for to glade, I shal don al my peine,
And in min herte seken every veine;
If to this soor ther may be founden salve,
It shal not lakken, certain, on min halve.”
Goth Pandarus, and Troilus he soughte,
Til in a temple he fond him allone,
As he that of his lif no lenger roughte;
But to the pitouse goddes everichone
Ful tendrely he preide, and made his mone,
To doon him sone out of this world to pace;
For wel he thought ther was non other grace.
And shortly, al the sothe for to seye,
He was so fallen in despeir that day,
That outrely he shoop him for to deie.
For right thus was his argument alwey:
He seide, he nas but loren, wailawey!
“For al that comth, comth by necessitee;
Thus to be lorn, it is my destinee.
“For certainly, this wot I wel,” he seide,
“That forsight of divine purveiaunce
Hath seyn alwey me to forgon Criseyde,
Sin God seeth every thing, out of doutaunce,
And hem desponeth, thourgh his ordenaunce,
In hir merites sothly for to be,
As they shul comen by predestinee.
“But nathelees, allas! whom shal I leve?
For ther ben grete clerkes many oon,
That destinee thorugh argumentes preve;
And som men seyn that nedely ther is noon;
But that free chois is yeven us everichoon.
O, welaway! so sleie arn clerkes olde,
That I not whos opinion I may holde.
“For som men seyn, if God seth al biforn,
Ne God may not deceived ben, pardee,
Than moot it fallen, though men hadde it sworn,
That purveiaunce hath seyn bifore to be.
Wherfor I seye, that from eterne if he
Hath wist biforn our thought eek as our dede,
We have no free chois, as these clerkes rede.
“For other thought nor other dede also
Might never be, but swich as purveiaunce,
Which may not ben deceived never mo,
Hath feled biforn, withouten ignoraunce.
For if ther mighte been a variaunce
To writhen out fro Goddes purveyinge,
Ther nere no prescience of thing cominge;
“But it were rather an opinioun
Uncertein, and no stedfast forseinge;
And certes, that were an abusioun,
That God shuld han no parfit cleer witinge
More than we men that han doutous weninge.
But swich an errour upon God to gesse
Were fals and foul, and wikked corsednesse.
“Eek this is an opinioun of somme
That han hir top ful heighe and smothe yshore;
They seyn right thus, that thing is not to come
For that the prescience hath seyn bifore
That it shal come; but they seyn, that therfore
That it shal come, therfore the purveiaunce
Wot it biforn withouten ignoraunce;
“And in this manere this necessitee
Retorneth in his part contrarie again.
For needfully bihoveth it not to be
That thilke thinges fallen in certain
That ben purveied; but nedely, as they seyn,
Bihoveth it that thinges, whiche that falle,
That they in certain ben purveyed alle.
“I mene, as though I laboured me in this,
To enqueren which thing cause of which thing be;
As whether that the prescience of God is
The certain cause of the necessitee
Of thinges that to comen been, pardee;
Or if necessitee of thing cominge
Be cause certein of the purveyinge.
“But now ne enforce I me nat in shewinge
How the ordre of causes stant; but wel wot I,
That it bihoveth that the bifallinge
Of thinges wist biforen certeinly
Be necessarie, al seme it not therby
That prescience put falling necessaire
To thing to come, al falle it foule or faire.
“For if ther sit a man yond on a see,
Than by necessitee bihoveth it
That, certes, thin opinioun soth be,
That wenest or coniectest that he sit;
And fertherover now ayenward yit,
Lo, right so it is of the part contrarie,
As thus; (now herkne, for I wol not tarie):
“I sey, that if the opinioun of thee
Be sooth, for that he sit, than seye I this,
That he mot sitten by necessitee;
And thus necessitee in either is.
For in him nede of sitting is, ywis,
And in thee nede of sooth; and thus, forsothe,
Ther moot necessitee ben in yow bothe.
“But thou mayst seyn, the man sit not therfore,
That thin opinion of his sitting soth is;
But rather, for the man sit ther bifore,
Therfore is thin opinion sooth, ywis.
And I seye, though the cause of sooth of this
Comth of his sitting, yet necessitee
Is entrechaunged, bothe in him and thee.
Thus in this same wise, out of doutaunce,
I may wel maken, as it semeth me,
My resoninge of Goddes purveiaunce,
And of the thinges that to comen be;
By whiche reson men may wel ysee,
That thilke thinges that in erthe falle,
That by necessitee they comen alle.
“For although that, for thing shal come, ywis,
Therfore is it purveied, certainly,
Nat that it comth for it purveied is:
Yet nathelees, bihoveth it nedfully,
That thing to come be purveied, trewely;
Or elles, thinges that purveied be,
That they bitiden by necessitee.
“And this suffiseth right ynow, certein,
For to destroye our free chois every del.—
But now is this abusion to seyn,
That fallinge of the thinges temporel
Is cause of Goddes prescience eternel.
Now trewely, that is a fals sentence,
That thing to come shold cause his prescience.
“What mighte I wene, and I had swich a thought,
But that God purveith thing that is to come
For that it is to come, and elles nought?
So mighte I wene that thinges alle and some,
That whilom been bifalle and overcome,
Ben cause of thilke soverein purveiaunce,
That forwot al withouten ignoraunce.
“And over al this, yet seye I more herto,
That right as whan I woot ther is a thing,
Ywis, that thing mot nedefully be so;
Eek right so, whan I woot a thing coming,
So mot it come; and thus the bifalling
Of thinges that ben wist bifore the tide,
They mow not been eschewed on no side.”
Than seide he thus, “Almighty Jove in trone,
That wost of al this thing the soothfastnesse,
Rewe on my sorwe, or do me deye sone,
Or bring Criseyde and me fro this distresse.”
And whil he was in al this hevinesse,
Disputing with himself in this matere,
Com Pandare in, and seide as ye may here.
“O mighty God,” quod Pandarus, “in trone,
Ey! who seigh ever a wis man faren so?
Why, Troilus, what thenkestow to done?
Hastow swich lust to been thin owene fo?
What, parde, yet is not Criseyde ago!
Why lust thee so thyself fordoon for drede,
That in thin heed thin eyen semen dede?
“Hastow not lived many a yeer biforn
Withouten hir, and ferd ful wel at ese?
Artow for hir and for non other born?
Hath kind thee wroughte al only hir to plese?
Lat be, and thenk right thus in thy disese.
That, in the dees right as ther fallen chaunces,
Right so in love, ther come and goon plesaunces.
“And yet this is a wonder most of alle,
Why thou thus sorwest, sin thou nost not yit,
Touching hir goinge, how that it shal falle,
Ne if she can hirself distorben it.
Thou hast not yet assayed al hir wit.
A man may al by time his nekke bede
Whan it shal of, and sorwen at the nede.
“Forthy take hede of what that I shal seye;
I have with hir yspoke and longe ybe,
So as accorded was bitwixe us tweye.
And evermo me thinketh thus, that she
Hath somwhat in hir hertes prevetee,
Wherwith she can, if I shal right arede,
Stint al this, of which thou art in drede.
“For which my counseil is, whan it is night,
Thou to hir go, and make of this an ende;
And blisful Juno, thourgh hir grete mighte,
Shal, as I hope, hir grace unto us sende.
Min herte seith, ‘Certein, she shal not wende’;
And forthi put thin herte a while in reste;
And hold this purpos, for it is the beste.”
This Troilus answerde, and sighte sore,
“Thou seyst right wel, and I wil do right so”;
And what him liste, he seide unto it more.
And whan that it was time for to go,
Ful prevely himself, withouten mo,
Unto hir com, as he was wont to done;
And how they wroughte, I shal yow telle sone.
Soth is, that whan they gonne first to mete,
So gan the peine hir hertes for to twiste,
That neither of hem other mighte grete,
But hem in armes toke and after kiste.
The lasse wofulle of hem bothe niste
Wher that he was, ne mighte o word out bringe,
As I seide erst, for wo and for sobbinge.
Tho woful teres that they leten falle
As bittre weren, out of teres kinde,
For peine, as is ligne aloës or galle.
So bittre teres weep nought, as I finde,
The woful Mirra through the bark and rinde.
That in this world ther nis so hard an herte,
That nolde han rewed on hir peines smerte.
But whan hir woful wery gostes tweine
Retorned been theras hem oughte dwelle,
And that somwhat to waiken gan the peine
By lengthe of pleinte, and ebben gan the welle
Of hire teres, and the herte unswelle,
With broken vois, al hoors forshright, Criseyde
To Troilus thise ilke wordes seide:
“O Jove, I deie, and mercy I beseche!
Help, Troilus!” and therwithal hir face
Upon his brest she leide, and loste speche;
Hir woful spirit from his propre place,
Right with the word, alwey up point to pace.
And thus she lith with hewes pale and grene,
That whilom fresh and fairest was to sene.
This Troilus, that on hir gan biholde,
Clepinge hir name (and she lay as for deed,
Withoute answere, and felte hir limes colde,
Hir eyen throwen upward to hir heed),
This sorwful man can now noon other reed,
But ofte time hir colde mouth he kiste;
Wher him was wo, God and himself it wiste!
He rist him up, and long streight he hir leide;
For signe of lif, for ought he can or may,
Can he noon finde in nothing on Criseyde,
For which his song ful ofte is “Weilaway!”
But whan he saugh that specheles she lay,
With sorwful vois, and herte of blisse al bare,
He seide how she was fro this world yfare!
So after that he longe hadde hir compleined,
His hondes wrong, and seid that was to seye,
And with his teres salte hir brest bireined,
He gan tho teris wipen of ful dreie,
And pitously gan for the soule preie,
And seide, “O Lord, that set art in thy trone,
Rewe eek on me, for I shal folwe hir sone!”
She cold was and withouten sentement,
For aught he woot, for breeth ne felte he noon;
And this was him a preignant argument
That she was forth out of this world agoon;
And whan he seigh ther was non other woon,
He gan hir limes dresse in swich manere
As men don hem that shul be leid on bere.
And after this, with sterne and cruel herte,
His swerd anoon out of his shethe he twighte,
Himself to sleen, how sore that him smerte,
So that his sowle hir sowle folwen mighte,
Theras the doom of Minos wolde it dighte;
Sin love and cruel Fortune it ne wolde,
That in this world he lenger liven sholde.
Than seide he thus, fulfild of heigh desdain,
“O cruel Jove, and thou, Fortune adverse,
This al and som, that falsly have ye slain
Criseyde, and sin ye may do me no werse,
Fy on your might and werkes so diverse!
Thus cowardly ye shul me never winne;
Ther shal no deeth me fro my lady twinne.
“For I this world, sin ye han slain hir thus,
Wol lete, and folwe hir spirit lowe or hie;
Shal never lover seyn that Troilus
Dar not, for fere, with his lady die;
For certein, I wol bere hir companie.
But sin ye wol not suffre us liven here,
Yet suffreth that our soules ben yfere.
“And thou, citee, whiche that I leve in wo,
And thou, Priam, and bretheren al yfere,
And thou, my moder, farewel! for I go;
And Attropos, make redy thou my bere!
And thou, Criseyde, o swete herte dere,
Receive now my spirit!” wolde he seye,
With swerd at herte, al redy for to deie.
But as God wolde, of swough therwith sh’abreide,
And gan to sike, and “Troilus” she cride;
And he answerde, “Lady min Criseyde,
Live ye yet?” and leet his swerd doun glide.
“Ye, herte min, that thanked be Cupide!”
Quod she, and therwithal she sore sighte;
And he bigan to glade hir as he mighte;
Took hir in armes two, and kiste hir ofte,
And hir to glade he dide al his entente;
For which hir goost, that flikered ay onlofte,
Ayein into hir herte al softe wente
But at the laste, as that hir eyen glente
Aside, anoon she gan his swerd aspie,
As it lay bare, and gan for fere crie,
And asked him, why he it hadde out drawe?
And Troilus anoon the cause hir tolde,
And how himself therwith he wolde have slawe.
For which Criseyde upon him gan biholde,
And gan him in hire armes faste folde,
And seide, “O mercy, God, lo, which a dede!
Allas! how neigh we were bothe dede!
“Thanne if I ne hadde spoken, as grace was,
Ye wolde han slain yourself anoon?” quod she.
“Ye, douteless”; and she answerde, “Allas!
For, by that ilke Lord that made me,
I nolde a forlong wey on live han be,
After your deeth, to han be crowned quene
Of al the lond the sonne on shineth shene.
“But with this selve swerd, which that here is,
Myselve I wolde have slain!”—quod she tho;
“But ho, for we han right ynow of this,
And late us rise and streight to bedde go;
And there lat us speken of our wo.
For, by the morter which that I see brenne,
Knowe I ful wel that day is not fer henne.”
Whan they were in hir bedde, in armes folde,
Nought was it lik tho nightes herebiforn;
For pitously ech other gan biholde,
As they that hadden al hir blisse ylorn,
Biwailinge ay the day that they were born.
Til at the last this sorwful wight Criseyde
To Troilus these ilke wordes seide:—
“Lo, herte min, wel wot ye this,” quod she,
“That if a wight alwey his wo compleine,
And seketh nought how holpen for to be,
It nis but folie and encrees of peine;
And sin that here assembled be we tweine
To finde bote of wo that we ben inne,
It were al time soone to biginne.
“I am a womman, as ful wel ye woot,
And as I am avised sodeinly,
So wol I telle yow, whil it is hoot.
Me thinketh thus, that neither ye nor I
Ought half this wo to make skilfully.
For there is art ynow for to redresse
That yet is mis, and sleen this hevinesse.
“Sooth is, the wo, the which that we ben inne,
For ought I woot, for nothing elles is
But for the cause that we sholden twinne.
Considered al, ther nis nomore amis.
But what is thanne a remede unto this,
But that we shape us soone for to mete?
This al and som, my dere herte swete.
“Now that I shal wel bringen it aboute
To come ayein, soone after that I go,
Therof am I no maner thing in doute.
For dredeles, withinne a wouke or two,
I shal ben here; and, that it may be so
By alle right, and in a wordes fewe,
I shal yow wel an heep of weyes shewe.
“For which I wol not make long sermoun,
For time ylost may not recovered be;
But I wol gon to my conclusioun,
And to the beste, in ought that I can see.
And, for the love of God, foryeve it me
If I speke ought ayein your hertes reste;
For trewely, I speke it for the beste;
“Makinge alwey a protestacioun,
That now these wordes, which that I shal seye,
Nis but to shewe yow my mocioun,
To finde unto our help the beste weye;
And taketh it non other wise, I preye.
For in effect whatso ye me comaunde,
That wol I doon, for that is no demaunde.
“Now herkeneth this, ye han wel understonde,
My goinge graunted is by parlement
So ferforth, that it may not be withstonde
For al this world, as by my jugement.
And sin ther helpeth noon avisement
To letten it, lat it passe out of minde;
And lat us shape a bettre wey to finde.
“The sothe is this, that twinninge of us tweine
Wol us disese and cruelliche anoie.
But him bihoveth somtime han a peine,
That serveth love, if that he wol have joye.
And sin I shal no ferthere out of Troye
Than I may ride ayein on half a morwe,
It oughte lasse causen us to sorwe.
So as I shal not so ben hid in muwe,
That day by day, min owene herte dere,
Sin wel ye woot that it is now a truwe,
Ye shul ful wel al min estat yhere.
And er that truwe is doon, I shal ben here,
And thanne have ye bothe Antenor ywonne
And me also; beth glad now, if ye conne;
“And thenk right thus, ‘Criseyde is now agoon,
But what! she shal come hastely ayeyn’;
And whanne, allas? by God, lo, right anoon,
Er dayes ten, this dar I saufly seyn.
And thanne at erste shul we been so fain,
So as we shal togederes ever dwelle,
Thal al this world ne mighte our blisse telle.
“I see that often, theras we ben now,
That for the beste, our conseil for to hide,
Ye speke not with me, nor I with yow
In fourtenight, ne see yow go ne ride.
May ye not ten dayes thanne abide,
For min honour, in swich an aventure?
Ywis, ye mowen elles lite endure!
Ye knowe eek how that al my kin is here,
But if that onliche it my fader be;
And eek min other thinges alle yfere,
And nameliche, my dere herte, ye,
Whom that I nolde leven for to see
For al this world, as wid as it hath space;
Or elles, see ich never Joves face!
Why trowe ye my fader in this wise
Coveiteth so to see me, but for drede
Lest in this toun that folkes me dispise
Bicause of him, for his unhappy dede?
What woot my fader what lif that I lede?
For if he wiste in Troy how wel I fare,
Us neded for my wending nought to care.
“Ye seen that every day eek, more and more,
Men trete of pees; and it supposed is,
That men the quene Eleine shal restore,
And Grekes us restore that is mis.
So though ther nere comfort noon but this,
That men purposen pees on every side,
Ye may the bettre at ese of herte abide.
“For if that it be pees, min herte dere,
The nature of the pees mot nedes drive
That men most entrecomunen yfere,
And to and fro eek ride and gon as blive
Alday as thikke as been flen from an hive;
And every wight han libertee to bleve
Wheras him list the bet, withouten leve.
“And though so be that pees ther may be noon,
Yet hider, though ther never pees ne were,
I moste come; for whider sholde I goon,
Or how—mischaunce!—sholde I dwelle there
Among tho men of armes ever in fere?
For which, as wisly God my soule rede,
I can not seen wherof ye sholden drede.
“Have here another wey, if it so be
That al this thing ne may yow not suffise.
My fader, as ye knowen wel, pardee,
Is old, and elde is ful of coveitise.
And I right now have founden al the gise,
Withoute net, wherwith I shal him hente;
And herkeneth how, if that ye wole assente.
“Lo, Troilus, men seyn that hard it is
The wolf ful, and the wether hool to have;
This is to seyn, that men ful ofte, ywis,
Mot spenden part, the remenaunt for to save.
For ay with gold men may the herte grave
Of him that set is upon coveitise;
And how I mene, I shal it yow devise.
“The moeble which that I have in this toun
Unto my fader shal I take, and seye,
That right for trust and for savacioun
It sent is from a freend of his or tweie,
The whiche freendes ferventliche him preye
To senden after more, and that in hie,
Whil that this toun stant thus in jupartie.
“And that shal been an huge quantitee,
Thus shal I seyn, but, lest it folk aspide,
This may be sent by no wight but by me;
I shal eek shewen him, if pees bitide,
What frendes that ich have on every side
Toward the court, to doon the wrathe pace
Of Priamus, and doon him stonde in grace.
“So, what for o thing and for other, swete,
I shal him so enchaunten with my sawes,
That right in hevene his sowle is, shal he mete!
For al Appollo, or his clerkes lawes,
Or calculinge availeth nought three hawes;
Desir of gold shal so his sowle blende,
That, as me list, I shal wel make an ende.
“And if he wolde ought by his sort it preve
If that I lie, in certain I shal fonde
Distorben him, and plukke him by the sleve,
Makinge his sort, and beren him on honde,
He hath not wel the goddes understonde.
For goddes speken in amphibologies,
And, for a sooth, they tellen twenty lies.
“Eek, drede fond first goddes, I suppose,
Thus shal I seyn, and that his cowarde herte
Made him amis the goddes text to glose,
Whan he for ferde out of his Delphos sterte.
And but I make him soone to converte,
And doon my reed withinne a day or tweie,
I wol to yow oblige me to deie.”
And treweliche, as writen wel I finde,
That al this thing was seid of good entente;
And that hir herte trewe was and kinde
Towardes him, and spak right as she mente,
And that she starf for wo neigh, whan she wente,
And was in purpos ever to be trewe;
Thus writen they that of hir werkes knewe.
This Troilus, with herte and eres spradde,
Herde al this thing devisen to and fro;
And verrailich him semed that he hadde
The selve wit; but yet to lete hir go
His herte misforyaf him evermo.
But finally, he gan his herte wreste
To trusten hir, and took it for the beste.
For which the grete furie of his penaunce
Was queint with hope, and therwith hem bitwene
Bigan for joy the amorouse daunce.
And as the briddes,whan the sonne is shene,
Deliten in hir song in leves grene,
Right so the wordes that they spake yfere
Delited hem, and made hir hertes clere.
But natheles, the wending of Criseyde,
For al this world, may nought out of his minde;
For which ful ofte he pitously hir preide,
That of hir heste he might hir trewe finde.
And seide hir, “Certes, if ye be unkinde,
And but ye come at day set into Troye,
Ne shal I never have hele, honour, ne joye.
“For also sooth as sonne uprist on morwe,
And, God! so wisly thou me, woful wrecche,
To reste bringe out of this cruel sorwe,
I wol myselven slee if that ye drecche.
But of my deeth though litel be to recche,
Yet, er that ye me cause so to smerte,
Dwel rather here, min owene swete herte!
“For trewely, min owene lady dere,
Tho sleightes yet that I have herd yow stere
Ful shaply been to failen alle yfere.
For thus men seyn, ‘That oon thenketh the bere,
But al another thenketh his ledere.’
Your sire is wis, and seid is, out of drede,
‘Men may the wise atrenne, and not atrede.’
“It is ful hard to halten unespied
Bifore a crepul, for he can the craft;
Your fader is in sleight as Argus yëd;
For al be that his moeble is him biraft,
His olde sleighte is yet so with him laft,
Ye shal not blende him for your womanhede,
Ne feine aright, and that is al my drede.
“I noot if pees shal evermo bitide;
But, pees or no, for ernest ne for game,
I woot, sin Calkas on the Grekes side
Hath ones been, and lost so foule his name,
He dar no more come here ayein for shame;
For which that weye, for ought I can espie,
To trusten on, nis but a fantasie.
“Ye shal eek seen, your fader shal yow glose
To been a wif, and as he can wel preche,
He shal som Grek so preise and wel alose,
That ravisshen he shal yow with his speche,
Or do yow doon by force as he shal teche.
And Troilus, of whom ye nil han routhe,
Shal causeles so sterven in his trouthe!
“And over al this, your fader shal despise
Us alle, and seyn this citee nis but lorn;
And that th’assege never shal arise,
Forwhy the Grekes han it alle sworn
Til we be slain, and doun our walles torn.
And thus he shal you with his wordes fere,
That ay drede I, that ye wol bleve there.
“Ye shul eek seen so many a lusty knight
Among the Grekes, ful of worthinesse,
And eche of hem with herte, wit, and might
To plesen yow don al his besinesse,
That ye shul dullen of the rudenesse
Of us sely Troyanes, but if routhe
Remorde yow, or vertue of your trouthe.
“And this to me so grevous is to thinke,
That fro my brest it wol my soule rende;
Ne dredeles, in me ther may not sinke
A good opinioun, if that ye wende;
For why your faderes sleighte wol us shende.
And if ye goon, as I have told yow yore
So thenk I nam but deed, withoute more.
“For which, with humble, trewe, and pitous herte,
A thousand times mercy I yow preye;
So reweth on min aspre peines smerte,
And doth somwhat, as that I shal yow seye,
And lat us stele away bitwixe us tweie;
And thenk that folie is, whan man may chese,
For accident his substaunce ay to lese.
“I mene this, that sin we mowe er day
Wel stele away, and been togider so,
What wit were it to putten in assay,
In cas ye sholden to your fader go,
If that ye mighte come ayein or no?
Thus mene I, that it were a gret folie
To put that sikernesse in jupartie.
“And vulgarly to speken of substaunce
Of tresour, may we bothe with us lede
Ynough to live in honour and plesaunce,
Til into time that we shul ben dede;
And thus we may eschewen al this drede.
For everich other wey ye can recorde,
Min herte, ywis, may therwith not acorde.
“And hardily, ne dredeth no poverte,
For I have kin and freendes elleswhere
That, though we comen in our bare sherte,
Us sholde neither lakke gold ne gere,
But been honoured whil we dwelten there.
And go we anoon, for, as in min entente,
This is the beste, if that ye wole assente.”
Criseyde him with a sik, right in this wise
Answerde, “Ywis, my dere herte trewe,
We may wel stele away, as ye devise,
And finde swiche unthrifty weyes newe;
But afterward, ful sore it wol us rewe.
And help me God so at my moste nede
As causeles ye suffren al this drede!
“For thilke day that I for cherisshinge
Or drede of fader, or of other wight,
Or for estat, delit, or for weddinge
Be fals to yow, my Troilus, my knight,
Saturnes doughter, Juno, thorugh hir might,
As wood as Athamante do me dwelle
Eternaly in Styx, the put of helle!
“And this on every god celestial
I swere it yow, and eek on eche goddesse,
On every nimphe and deite infernal,
On satiry and fauny more and lesse,
That halve goddes been of wildernesse;
And Attropos my threed of lif tobreste
If I be fals; now trow me if thow leste!
“And thou, Simois, that as an arwe clere
Thorugh Troye ay rennest downward to the see,
Ber witnesse of this word that seid is here,
That thilke day that ich untrewe be
To Troilus, min owene herte free,
That thou retorne bakwarde to thy welle,
And I with body and soule sinke in helle!
“But that ye speke, awey thus for to go
And leten alle your freendes, God forbede,
For any womman, that ye sholden so,
And namely, sin Troye hath now swich nede
Of help; and eek of o thing taketh hede,
If this were wist, my lif laye in balaunce,
And your honour; God shilde us fro mischaunce!
“And if so be that pees herafter take,
As alday happeth, after anger, game,
Why, lord! the sorwe and wo ye wolden make,
That ye ne dorste come ayein for shame!
And er that ye juparten so your name,
Beth nought to hasty in this hote fare;
For hasty man ne wanteth never care.
“What trowe ye the peple eek al aboute
Wolde of it seye? It is ful light t’arede.
They wolden seye, and swere it, out of doute,
That love ne droof yow nought to doon this dede,
But lust voluptuous and coward drede.
Thus were al lost, ywis, min herte dere,
Your honour, which that now shineth so clere.
“And also thenketh on min honestee,
That floureth yet, how foule I sholde it shende,
And with what filthe it spotted sholde be,
If in this forme I sholde with yow wende.
Ne though I livede unto the worldes ende,
My name sholde I never ayeinward winne;
Thus were I lost, and that were routhe and sinne.
“And forthy slee with reson al this hete;
Men seyn, ‘The suffraunt overcometh,’ pardee;
Eek ‘Whoso wol han leef, he leef mot lete’;
Thus maketh vertue of necessitee
By pacience, and thenk that lord is he
Of fortune ay, that nought wol of hir recche;
And she ne daunteth no wight but a wrecche.
“And trusteth this, that certes, herte swete,
Er Phebus suster, Lucina the shene,
The Leoun passe out of this Ariete,
I wol ben here, withouten any wene.
I mene, as help me Juno, hevenes quene,
The tenthe day, but if that deeth m’assaile,
I wol yow seen, withouten any faile.”
“And now, so this be sooth,” quod Troilus,
“I shal wel suffre unto the tenthe day,
Sin that I see that nede it moot be thus.
But, for the love of God, if it be may,
So lat us stele prively away;
For ever in oon, as for to live in reste,
Min herte seith that it wol been the beste.”
“O mercy, God, what lif is this?” quod she;
“Allas, ye slee me thus for verray tene!
I see wel now that ye mistrusten me;
For by your wordes it is wel ysene.
Now, for the love of Cynthia the shene,
Mistrust me not thus causeles, for routhe;
Sin to be trewe I have yow plight my trouthe.
“And thenketh wel, that som time it is wit
To spende a time, a time for to winne;
Ne, pardee, lorn am I nought fro yow yit,
Though that we been a day or two atwinne.
Drif out the fantasyes yow withinne;
And trusteth me, and leveth eek your sorwe,
Or here my trouthe, I wol not live til morwe.
“For if ye wist how sore it doth me smerte,
Ye wolde cesse of this; for God, thou wost,
The pure spirit wepeth in min herte,
To see yow wepen that I love most,
And that I moot gon to the Grekes ost.
Ye, nere it that I wiste remedie
To come ayein, right here I wolde die!
“But certes, I am not so nice a wight
That I ne can imaginen a way
To come ayein that day that I have hight.
For who may holde a thing that wol away?
My fader nought, for al his queinte pley.
And by my thrift, my wending out of Troye
Another day shal torne us alle to joye.
“Forthy, with al min herte I yow beseke,
If that yow list don oughte for my preiere,
And for the love which that I love yow eke,
That er that I departe fro yow here,
That of so good a comfort and a chere
I may you seen, that ye may bringe at reste
Min herte, which that is at point to breste.
“And over al this, I pray yow,” quod she tho,
“Min owene hertes soothfast suffisaunce,
Sin I am thin al hool, withouten mo,
That whil that I am absent, no plesaunce
Of othere do me fro your remembraunce.
For I am ever agast, forwhy men rede,
That ‘love is thing ay ful of bisy drede.’
“For in this world ther liveth lady noon,
If that ye were untrewe—as God defende!—
That so bitraised were or wo bigoon
As I, that alle trouthe in yow entende.
And douteles, if that ich other wende,
I nere but deed; and er ye cause finde,
For Goddes love, so beth me not unkinde.”
To this answerde Troilus and seide,
“Now God, to whom ther nis no cause ywrie,
Me glade, as wis I never unto Criseyde,
Sin thilke day I saw hir first with yë,
Was fals, ne never shal til that I die.
At shorte wordes, wel ye may me leve;
I can no more, it shal be founde at preve.”
“Graunt mercy, goode min, ywis,” quod she,
“And blisful Venus lat me never sterve
Er I may stonde of plesaunce in degree
To quite him wel, that so wel can deserve;
And whil that God my wit wol me conserve,
I shal so doon, so trewe I have yow founde,
That ay honour to meward shal rebounde.
“For trusteth wel, that your estat royal
Ne vein delit, nor only worthinesse
Of yow in werre, or torney marcial,
Ne pompe, array, nobley, or eek richesse,
Ne made me to rewe on your distresse;
But moral vertue, grounded upon trouthe,
That was the cause I first hadde on yow routhe!
“Eek gentil herte and manhod that ye hadde,
And that ye hadde, as me thoughte, in despit
Every thing that souned into badde,
As rudenesse and poeplish appetit;
And that your reson bridled your delit,
This made, aboven every creature,
That I was your, and shal, whil I may dure.
“And this may lengthe of yeres not fordo,
Ne remuable fortune deface;
But Juppiter, that of his might may do
The sorwful to be glad, so yeve us grace,
Er nightes ten, to meten in this place,
So that it may your herte and min suffise;
And fareth now wel, for time is that ye rise.”
And after that they longe ypleined hadde,
And ofte ykist and streite in armes folde,
The day gan rise, and Troilus him cladde,
And rewfulliche his lady gan biholde,
As he that felte dethes cares colde.
And to hir grace he gan him recomaunde;
Wher him was wo, this holde I no demaunde.
For mannes heed imaginen ne can,
N’entendement considere, ne tonge telle
The cruel peines of this sorwful man,
That passen every torment doun in helle.
For whan he saugh that she ne mighte dwelle,
Which that his soule out of his herte rente,
Withouten more, out of the chaumbre he wente.
