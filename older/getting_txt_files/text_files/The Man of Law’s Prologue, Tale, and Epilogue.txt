¶Our Hoste sey° wel that the brighte sonne
The ark° of his artificial day° had ronne
The fourthe part, and half an houre, and more;
And though he were not depe ystert° in lore,
He wiste° it was the eightetethe° day
Of April, that is messager to May;
And sey° wel that the shadwe of every tree
Was as in lengthe the same quantitee
That was the body erect that caused it.
And therfor by the shadwe he took his wit°
That Phebus,° which that shoon so clere and brighte,
Degrees was five and fourty clombe on highte;
And for that day, as in that latitude,
It was ten of the clokke, he gan conclude,
And sodeinly he plighte° his hors aboute.

¶“Lordinges,” quod he, “I warne° yow, al this route,°
The fourthe party of this day is goon;°
Now, for the love of God and of Seint John,
Leseth° no time, as ferforth as ye may;°
Lordinges, the time wasteth° night and day,
And steleth from us, what prively slepinge,
And what° thurgh necligence in our wakinge,
As dooth the streem, that turneth never again,
Descending fro the montaigne into plain.
Wel can° Senek, and many a philosophre
Biwailen° time, more than gold in cofre.°
‘For los of catel° may recovered be,
But los of time shendeth° us,’ quod he.
It wol nat come again, withouten drede,°
Na more than wol Malkins maidenhede,°
Whan she hath lost it in hir wantownesse;°
Lat us nat moulen° thus in idelnesse.

¶“Sir Man of Lawe,” quod he, “so have ye blis,°
Tel us a tale anon,° as forward° is;
Ye been submitted° thurgh your free assent
To stonde in this cas° at my jugement.
Acquiteth° yow, and holdeth your biheste,°
Than have ye doon your devoir° atte leste.”°

¶“Hoste,” quod he, “depardieux° ich° assente;
To breke forward° is not min entente.
Biheste° is dette, and I wol holde fain°
Al my biheste; I can no better seyn.°
For swich lawe as man yeveth° another wight,°
He sholde himselven usen it by right;°
Thus wol° our text; but natheles certein
I can right now no thrifty° tale seyn,
But Chaucer, though° he can but lewedly°
On° metres and on riming craftily,°
Hath seid° hem in swich English as he can
Of olde time,° as knoweth many a man.
And if he have not seid hem, leve° brother,
In o° book, he hath seid hem in another.
For he hath told of loveres up and doun°
Mo° than Ovide made of mencioun
In his Epistelles, that been ful olde.
What° sholde I tellen hem, sin° they ben tolde?
In youthe he made° of Ceys° and Alcion,°
And sithen° hath he spoke of everichon,°
Thise noble wives and thise loveres eek.
Whoso that wol his large volume seek
Cleped° the Seintes Legende of Cupide,
Ther may he seen the large woundes wide
Of Lucresse, and of Babilan° Tisbee;°
The swerd of Dido for the false Enee;°
The tree of Phillis for hir Demophon;
The pleinte° of Dianire and Hermion,
Of Adriane° and of Isiphilee;°
The bareine° ile stonding in the see;
The dreinte° Leander for his Erro;°
The teres of Eleine,° and eek° the wo
Of Brixseide,° and of thee, Ladomëa;°
The crueltee of thee, queen Medëa,
Thy litel children hanging by the hals°
For thy Jason, that was of love so fals!
O Ypermistra,° Penelopee, Alceste,
Your wifhod he comendeth with the beste!
But certeinly no word ne writeth he
Of thilke wikke° ensample of Canacee,
That lovede hir owne brother sinfully;
Of swiche cursed stories I sey ‘fy’;
Or elles of Tyro Apollonius,
How that the cursed king Antiochus
Birafte° his doghter of hir maidenhede,°
That is so horrible a tale for to rede,
Whan he hir threw upon the pavement.
And therfor he, of ful avisement,°
Nolde° never write in none of his sermouns°
Of swiche unkinde° abhominaciouns,
Ne I wol noon reherse, if that I may.

¶But of my tale how shal I doon this day?
Me were looth° be likned,° doutelees,
To Muses that men clepe° Pierides—
Metamorphoseos wot what I mene:—
But nathelees, I recche noght a bene°
Though I come after him with hawebake;°
I speke in prose, and lat him rimes make.”
And with that word he, with a sobre chere,
Bigan his tale, as ye shal after here.

O hateful harm! condicion of poverte!
With thurst, with cold, with hunger so confounded!
To asken help thee shameth in thin herte;
If thou noon ask, with nede artow so wounded,
That verray nede unwrappeth al thy wounde hid!
Maugree thin heed,° thou most for indigence°
Or° stele, or begge, or borwe° thy despence!°

Thou blamest Crist, and seyst° ful bitterly,
He misdeparteth° richesse temporal;
Thy neighebour thou witest° sinfully,
And seyst thou hast to lite, and he hath al.
“Parfay,”° seistow, “somtime he rekne shal,
Whan that his tail° shal brennen in the glede,°
For° he noght helpeth needfulle° in hir nede.”

Herkne what is the sentence° of the wise:—
“Bet° is to dyen than have indigence”;
Thy selve° neighebour wol thee despise;
If thou be povre, farwel thy reverence!°
Yet of the wise man tak this sentence:°—
“Alle the dayes of povre men ben wikke”;°
Be war therfor, er thou come in that prikke!°

If thou be povre, thy brother hateth thee,
And alle thy freendes fleen fro° thee, alas!
O riche marchaunts, ful of wele° ben ye,
O noble, o prudent folk, as in this cas!
Your bagges been nat filled with ambes as,°
But with sis cink,° than renneth for° your chaunce;°
At Cristemasse merie may ye daunce!
Ye seken° lond and see for your winninges,

As wise folk ye knowen al th’estaat°
Of regnes;° ye ben fadres° of tidinges°
And tales, bothe of pees and of debat.°
I were right now of tales desolat,°
Nere° that a marchaunt, goon is many a yere,°
Me taughte a tale, which that ye shal here.

In Surrie° whilom° dwelte a companie
Of chapmen° riche, and therto sadde and trewe,°

That widewher° senten her spicerie,°
Clothes of gold, and satins riche of hewe;°
Her chaffar° was so thrifty° and so newe,°
That every wight° hath deintee° to chaffare°
With hem, and eek to sellen hem hir ware.°

Now fel° it, that the maistres° of that sort°
Han shapen° hem to Rome for to wende;
Were it° for chapmanhode° or for disport,°
Nan other message° wolde they thider sende,
But comen hemself to Rome, this is the ende;
And in swich° place, as thoughte hem avantage°
For her entente, they take° her herbergage.°

Sojourned han thise marchants in that toun
A certein time, as fel to hir plesance.
And so bifel, that renoun
Of th’emperoures doghter, dame Custance,
Reported was, with every circumstance,°
Unto thise Surrien marchants in swich wise,
Fro day to day, as I shal yow devise.°

This was the commune vois of every man—
“Our Emperour of Rome, God him see,°
A doghter hath that, sin° the world bigan,
To rekne° as wel hir goodnesse as beautee,
Nas never swich° another as is she;
I prey to God in honour hir sustene,
And wold she were of al Europe the quene.

In hir is heigh beautee, withoute pride,
Yowthe, withoute grenehede° or folie;°
To alle hir werkes vertu is hir gide,
Humblesse° hath slain in hir al tirannie.°
She is mirour° of alle curteisie;°
Hir herte is verray chambre of holinesse,
Hir hand, ministre° of fredom for almesse.”°

And al this vois° was soth,° as God is trewe,
But now to purpos lat us turne again;
Thise marchants han doon fraught° hir shippes newe,
And, whan they han this blisful maiden seyn,°
Hoom to Surrie been they went ful fain,°
And doon her nedes° as they han don yore,°
And liven in wele;° I can sey yow no more.

Now fel it,° that thise marchants stode in grace
Of him, that was the Sowdan° of Surrie;
For whan they came from any strange place,
He wolde, of his benigne curteisie,°
Make hem good chere, and bisily espie
Tidings of sondry regnes, for to lere°
The wondres that they mighte seen or here.

Amonges othere thinges, specially
Thise marchants han him told of dame Custance,
So gret noblesse in ernest, ceriously,°
That this Sowdan hath caught so gret plesance
To han hir figure in his remembrance,
That al his lust° and al his bisy cure°
Was for to love hir whil his lif may dure.°

Paraventure° in thilke° large book
Which that men clepe° the heven, ywriten was
With sterres, whan that he his birthe took,
That he for love shulde han his deeth, allas!
For in the sterres, clerer than is glas,°
Is writen, God wot,° whoso coude° it rede,
The deeth of every man, withouten drede.°

In sterres, many a winter therbiforn,
Was writen the deeth of Ector, Achilles,
Of Pompey, Julius, er° they were born;
The strif° of Thebes; and of Ercules,
Of Sampson, Turnus, and of Socrates
The deeth; but mennes wittes been so dulle,
That no wight° can wel rede it atte fulle.

This Sowdan for his privee conseil° sente,
And, shortly of this mater for to pace,°
He hath to hem declared his entente,
And seide hem certein, “But° he mighte have grace
To han Custance withinne a litel space,°
He nas but deed”;° and charged hem, in hie,°
To shapen° for his lif som remedie.

Diverse men diverse thinges seiden;
They argumenten, casten° up and doun;
Many a subtil resoun forth they leiden,°
They speken of magik and abusioun;°
But finally, as in conclusioun,
They can not seen in that non avantage,
Ne in non other wey, save mariage.

Than saw they therin swich° difficultee
By wey of resoun, for to speke al plain,
Bicause that ther was swich diversitee
Bitwene hir bothe lawes,° that they sayn,
They trowe° “That no Cristen prince wold fain°
Wedden his child under oure lawes swete°

That us were taught by Mahoun° our prophete.”
And he answerde, “Rather than I lese°
Custance, I wol be cristned° doutelees;
I mot° ben hires, I may non other chese.
I prey yow holde your arguments in pees;
Saveth my lif, and beeth noght recchelees°
To geten hir that hath my lif in cure;°
For in this wo I may not longe endure.”

What nedeth gretter dilatacioun?°
I seye, by tretis° and embassadrie,°
And by the Popes mediacioun,
And al the chirche, and al the chivalrie,°
That, in destruccioun of Maumetrie,°
And in encrees of Cristes lawe dere,
They ben acorded, so as ye shal here.

How that the Sowdan° and his baronage
And alle his liges° shulde ycristned° be,
And he shal han Custance in mariage,
And certein gold, I noot° what quantitee,
And herto founden suffisant seurtee;°
This same acord was sworn on either side;
Now, faire Custance, almighty God thee gide!

Now wolde som men waiten,° as I gesse,
That shulde I tellen al the purveiance°
That th’emperour, of his grete noblesse,
Hath shapen° for his doghter dame Custance.
Wel may men knowe that so gret ordinance
May no man tellen in a litel clause°
As was arrayed° for so heigh a cause.

Bisshopes ben shapen° with hir for to wende,°
Lordes, ladies, knightes of renoun,
And other folk ynogh,° this is the ende;
And notified° is thurghout the toun
That every wight, with gret devocioun,
Shulde preyen Crist that he this mariage
Receive in gree,° and spede° this viage.°

The day is comen of hir departinge,
I sey, the woful day fatal° is come,
That ther may be no lenger taryinge,
But forthward they hem dressen,° alle and some;
Custance, that was with sorwe° al overcome,
Ful pale arist,° and dresseth hir to wende;
For wel she seeth ther is non other ende.°

Allas! what wonder is it though she wepte,
That shal be sent to strange nacioun
Fro freendes, that so tendrely hir kepte,°
And to be bounden under subjeccioun°
Of oon, she knoweth not his condicioun.°
Housbondes been alle gode, and han ben yore,°
That knowen wives, I dar say yow no more.

“Fader,” she saide, “thy wrecched° child Custance,
Thy yonge doghter, fostred up° so softe,
And ye, my moder, my soverain plesance
Over alle thing, outtaken° Crist onlofte,°
Custance, your child, hir recomandeth ofte
Unto your grace, for I shal to Surrië,
Ne shal I never seen yow more with yë.°

Allas! unto the Barbre nacioun
I moste° anon, sin that it is your wille;
But Crist, that starf° for our redempcioun,
So yeve me grace, his hestes° to fulfille;
I, wrecche womman, no fors° though I spille.°
Wommen are born to thraldom and penance,°
And to ben under mannes governance.”

I trowe, at Troye, whan Pirrus brak° the wal
Or° Ylion° brende, at Thebes the citee,
N’at° Rome, for the harm thurgh Hanibal
That Romains hath venquisshed times thre,
Nas° herd swich tendre weping for pitee
As in the chambre was for° hir departinge;
Bot forth she moot,° wherso she wepe° or singe.

O Firste Moevinge° cruel firmament,
With thy diurnal sweigh° that crowdest ay°
And hurlest al° from Est til Occident,°
That naturelly wolde holde another way,
Thy crowding° set the heven in swich array
At the beginning of this fiers° viage,
That cruel Mars hath slain° this mariage.

Infortunat ascendent tortuous,
Of which the lord° is helples falle,° allas!
Out of his angle° into the derkest hous.
O Mars, O atazir,° as in this cas!
O feble mone, unhappy° been thy pas!
Thou knittest° thee ther thou art nat received,°
Ther thou were weel, fro thennes artow weived.°

Imprudent emperour of Rome, allas!
Was ther no philosophre° in al thy toun?
Is no time bet° than other in swich cas?
Of viage is ther noon eleccioun,°
Namely° to folk of heigh condicioun,
Nat whan a rote° is of a birthe yknowe?
Allas! we ben to lewed° or to slowe.

To shippe is brought this woful faire maide
Solempnely, with every circumstance.°
“Now Jesu Crist be with yow all,” she saide;
Ther nis namore° but “farewel! fair Custance!”
She peineth hir° to make good countenance,°
And forth I lete° hir saile in this manere,
And turne I wol again to my matere.

The moder of the Sowdan, welle° of vices,
Espiëd hath hir sones plein entente,
How he wol lete° his olde sacrifices,
And right anon she for hir conseil° sente;
And they ben come, to knowe what she mente.°
And when assembled was this folk infere,°
She sette hir doun, and saide as ye shal here.

“Lordes,” quod she, “ye knowen everichon,°
How that my sone in point is for to lete°
The holy lawes of our Alkaron,°
Yeven° by Goddes message° Makomete.°
But oon avow° to grete God I hete,°
The lif shal rather out of my body sterte°
Than Makometes lawe out of min herte!

What shulde us tiden° of this newe lawe
But thraldom° to our bodies and penance?°
And afterward in helle to be drawe°
For we reneyed° Mahoun° our creance?°
But, lordes, wol ye maken assurance,
As I shal seyn, assenting to my lore,
And I shall make us sauf for evermore?”

They sworen and assenten, every man,
To live with hir and die, and by hir stonde;°
And everich, in the beste wise° he can,
To strengthen hir shal alle his freendes fonde;°
And she hath this emprise° ytake on honde,
Which ye shal heren that I shal devise,
And to hem alle she spak right in this wise.

“We shul first feine° us Cristendom to take,
Cold° water shal not greve° us but a lite;°
And I shal swich a feste and revel make,
That, as I trowe,° I shal the Sowdan quite.°
For though his wif be cristned never so white,
She shal have nede to wasshe awey the rede,°
Thogh she a fontful° water with hir lede.”°

O Sowdanesse,° rote° of iniquitee,
Virago,° thou Semiram° the secounde,
O serpent under femininitee,
Lik to the serpent depe in helle ybounde,
Oh feined womman,° al that may confounde
Vertu and innocence, thurgh thy malice,
Is bred in thee, as nest of every vice!

O Satan, envious sin° thilke day
That thou were chased from our heritage,°
Wel knowestow to wommen the olde way!
Thou madest Eva bringe us in servage.°
Thou wolt fordoon° this Cristen mariage.
Thin instrument so, weilawey° the while
Makestow of wommen, whan thou wolt begile.°

This Sowdanesse, whom I thus blame and warie,°
Leet° prively hir conseil goon hir° way.
What sholde I in this tale lenger tarie?°
She rideth to the Sowdan on a day,
And seide him, that she wolde reneie hir lay,°
And Cristendom of° preestes handes fonge,°
Repenting hir she hethen° was so longe,

Biseching him to doon hir that honour,
That she moste° han the Cristen folk to feste;°
“To plesen hem I wol do my labour.”
The Sowdan seith, “I wol don at your heste,”°
And kneling thanketh hir of that requeste.
So glad he was, he niste° what to seye;
She kiste hir sone, and hoom she gooth hir weye.

Arrived ben this Cristen folk to londe,
In Surrie, with a greet solempne route,
And hastily this Sowdan sente his sonde,°
First to his moder, and al the regne aboute,
And seide, his wif was comen, out of doute,
And preide hir for to ride again° the quene,
The honour of his regne to sustene.

Gret was the prees,° and riche was th’array
Of Surriens and Romains met yfere;°
The moder of the Sowdan, riche and gay,
Receiveth hir with also glad a chere°
As any moder mighte hir doghter dere,
And to the nexte citee ther biside
A softe pas° solempnely they ride.

Noght trowe° I the triumphe of Julius,
Of which that Lucan maketh swich a bost,°
Was royaller, ne more curious°
Than was th’assemblee of this blisful host.
But this scorpioun, this wikked gost,°
The Sowdanesse, for al hir flateringe,
Caste° under this° ful mortally to stinge.

The Sowdan comth himself sone° after this
So royally, that wonder is to telle,
And welcometh hir with alle joye and blis.
And thus in merthe and joye I lete hem dwelle.
The fruit of this matere is that I telle.
Whan time cam, men thoughte it for the beste
That revel stinte,° and men goon to hir reste.

The time cam, this olde Sowdanesse
Ordeined hath this feste of which I tolde,
And to the feste Cristen folk hem dresse°
In general, ye! bothe yonge and olde.
Here may men feste and royaltee biholde,
And deintees° mo than I can yow devise,
But al to dere they boughte it° er they rise.

O sodein wo! that ever art successour
To worldly blisse, spreind° with bitternesse;
Th’ende of the joye of our worldly labour;
Wo occupieth the fin° of our gladnesse.
Herke this conseil for thy sikernesse,°
Upon thy glade day have in thy minde
The unwar° wo or harm that comth bihinde.

For shortly for to tellen at o word,
The Sowdan° and the Cristen everichone
Ben al tohewe° and stiked° at the bord,
But it were only dame Custance allone.
This olde Sowdanesse, cursed crone,°
Hath with hir frendes doon this cursed dede,
For she hirself wolde al the contree lede.°

Ne ther was Surrien noon that was converted
That of the conseil of the Sowdan woot,°
That he nas al tohewe° er° he asterted.°
And Custance han they take anon, foot-hoot,°
And in a shippe al sterelees,° God woot,
They han hir set, and bidde° hir lerne° saile
Out of Surrie againward° to Itaile.

A certein tresor that she thider ladde,°
And, sooth to sayn, vitaille° gret plentee
They han hir yeven,° and clothes eek she hadde,
And forth she saileth in the salte see.
O my Custance, ful of benignitee,°
O emperoures yonge doghter dere,
He that is lord of fortune be thy stere!°

She blesseth hir,° and with ful pitous vois
Unto the crois of Crist thus seide she,
“O clere, o welful° auter,° holy crois,
Reed of° the lambes blood full of pitee,
That wesh° the world fro the olde iniquitee,°
Me fro the feend, and fro his clawes kepe,
That day that I shal drenchen° in the depe.

Victorious tree,° proteccioun of trewe,°
That only worthy were for to bere
The king of hevene with his woundes newe,
The white lamb, that hurt was with the spere,
Flemere of feendes° out of him and here
On which° thy limes° feithfully extenden,
Me keep, and yif me might my lif t’amenden.”

Yeres and dayes fleet° this creature
Thurghout the see of Grece° unto the straite
Of Marrok,° as it was hir aventure;
On many a sory° meel now may she baite;°
After her deeth ful often may she waite,°
Er that the wilde wawes wole hir drive
Unto the place, ther she shal arrive.

Men mighten asken why she was not slain?
Eek° at the fest who mighte hir body save?
And I answere to that demaunde° again,
Who saved Daniel in the horrible cave,°
Ther every wight save he,° maister and knave,°
Was with the leoun frete° er he asterte?°
No wight but God, that he bar in his herte.

God liste° to shewe his wonderful miracle
In hir, for° we sholde seen his mighty werkes;
Crist, which that is to every harm triacle,°
By certein menes° ofte, as knowen clerkes,
Doth thing for certein ende that ful derk° is
To mannes wit, that for our ignorance
Ne con not knowe his prudent purveiance.°

Now, sith° she was not at the feste yslawe,°
Who kepte hir fro the drenching° in the see?
Who kepte Jonas in the fisshes mawe°
Til he was spouted up° at Ninevee?°
Wel may men knowe it was no wight° but he
That kepte peple Ebraik° fro hir drenchinge,°
With drye feet thurghout the see° passinge.

Who bad° the foure spirits of tempest,
That power han t’anoyen° land and see,
“Bothe north and south, and also west and est,
Anoyeth neither see, ne land, ne tree?”
Sothly, the comaundour of that was he,
That fro the tempest ay° this womman kepte
As wel whan that she wook as whan she slepte.

Wher mighte this womman mete° and drinke have?
Three yeer and more how lasteth hir vitaille?°
Who fedde the Egipcien Marie in the cave,
Or in desert? no wight but Crist, sans faille.°
Five thousand folk it was as gret mervaille
With loves° five and fisshes two to fede.
God sente his foison° at hir grete nede.

She driveth forth° into our occean
Thurghout our wilde see, til, atte laste,
Under an hold° that nempnen° I ne can,
Fer in Northumberlond the wawe° hir caste,°
And in the sond° hir ship stiked° so faste,
That thennes wolde it noght of al a tide,°
The wille of Crist was that she shulde abide.°

The constable of the castel doun is fare°
To seen this wrak,° and al the ship he soghte,
And fond this wery womman ful of care;
He fond also the tresor that she broghte.
In hir langage mercy she bisoghte
The lif out of hir body for to twinne,°
Hir to delivere of wo that she was inne.

A maner° Latin corrupt° was hir speche,
But algates° therby was she understonde;
The constable, whan him list° no lenger seche,
This woful womman broghte he to the londe;
She kneleth doun, and thanketh Goddes sonde.°
But what° she was, she wolde no man seye,°
For foul ne fair,° thogh that she shulde deie.°

She seide, she was so mased° in the see
That she forgat hir minde,° by hir trouthe;
The constable hath of hir so greet pitee,
And eek° his wif, that they wepen for routhe,°
She was so diligent, withouten slouthe,°
To serve and plese everich in that place,
That alle hir loven that loken on hir face.

This constable and dame Hermengild his wif
Were payens,° and that contree every where;
But Hermengild lovede hir right as hir° lif,
And Custance hath so longe sojourned there,
In orisons,° with many a bitter tere,
Til Jesu hath converted thurgh his grace
Dame Hermengild, constablesse of that place.

In al that lond no cristen durste route,°
Alle cristen folk ben fled fro that contree
Thurgh payens,° that conquereden al aboute
The plages° of the North, by land and see;
To Walis° fled the cristianitee
Of olde Britons, dwellinge in this ile;
Ther was hir refut° for the mene while.

But yet nere° Cristen Britons so exiled
That ther nere somme that in hir privetee°
Honoured Crist, and hethen folk bigiled;°
And ny° the castel swich° ther dwelten three.
That oon of hem was blind, and mighte nat see
But it were with thilke yën° of his minde,
With whiche men seen, after that they ben blinde.

Bright was the sonne as in that someres day,
For which the constable and his wif also
And Custance han ytake the righte way
Toward the see, a furlong° wey or two,
To pleyen and to romen to and fro;
And in hir walk this blinde man they mette
Croked and old, with yën faste yshette.°

“In name of Criste,” cride this blinde Britoun,
“Dame Hermengild, yif° me my sighte again.”
This lady wex affrayed° of the soun,
Lest that hir housbond, shortly for to sayn,
Wolde hir for Jesu Cristes love han slain,
Til Custance made hir bold, and bad° hir werche
The wil of Crist, as doghter of his chirche.

The constable wex abasshed° of that sight,
And seide, “What amounteth° al this fare?”°
Custance answerde, “Sire, it is Cristes might,
That helpeth folk out of the feendes snare.”°
And so ferforth she gan our lay° declare,
That she the constable, er° that it were eve,
Converted, and on Crist made him bileve.

This constable was no thing lord of this place
Of which I speke, ther he Custance fond,°
But kepte it strongly, many wintres space,
Under Alla, king of al Northumberlond,
That was ful wis, and worthy of his hond
Again the Scottes, as men may wel here,
But turne I wol again to my matere.

Sathan, that ever us waiteth° to bigile,
Saugh of Custance al hir perfeccioun,
And caste° anon how he mighte quite hir while,°
And made a yong knight, that dwelte in that toun
Love hir so hote,° of foul affeccioun,°
That verraily him thoughte he shulde spille°
But he of hir mighte ones have his wille.

He woweth° hir, but it availleth noght,
She wolde do no sinne, by no weye;
And, for despit,° he compassed° in his thoght
To maken hir on shamful deth to deie.
He waiteth whan the constable was aweye,
And prively, upon a night, he crepte
In Hermengildes chambre whil she slepte.

Wery, forwaked° in her orisouns,
Slepeth Custance, and Hermengild also.
This knight, thurgh Sathanas temptaciouns,
Al softely is to the bed ygo,
And kitte° the throte of Hermengild atwo,
And leide the blody knif by dame Custance,
And wente his wey, ther° God yeve° him meschance!

Sone after comth this constable hoom again,
And eek Alla, that king was of that lond,
And saugh his wif despitously° yslain,
For which ful ofte he weep and wrong° his hond,
And in the bed the blody knif he fond°
By dame Custance; allas! what might she seye?
For verray wo hir wit was al aweye.

To king Alla was told al this meschance,°
And eek the time, and where, and in what wise
That in a ship was founden dame Custance,
As heerbiforn that ye han herd devise.°
The kinges herte of pitee gan agrise,°
Whan he saugh so benigne a creature
Falle in disese° and in misaventure.

For as the lomb toward his deeth is broght,
So stant° this innocent bifore the king;
This false knight that hath this tresoun wroght
Berth hir on hond° that she hath doon this thing.
But nathelees, ther was greet moorning
Among the peple, and seyn, they can not gesse
That she hath doon so greet a wikkednesse.

For they han seyn° hir ever so vertuous,
And loving Hermengild right as her lif.°
Of this bar witnesse everich in that hous
Save he that Hermengild slow° with his knif.
This gentil king hath caught a gret motif°
Of this witnesse, and thoghte he wolde enquere
Depper in this, a trouthe for to lere.°

Allas! Custance! thou hast no champioun,
Ne fighte canstow nought, so weilawey!°
But he, that starf° for our redempcioun
And bond Sathan (and yit lith° ther he lay)
So be thy stronge champioun this day!
For, but if° Crist open miracle kithe,°
Withouten gilt thou shalt be slain as swithe.°

She sette her doun on knees, and thus she saide,
“Immortal God, that savedest Susanne
Fro false blame, and thou, merciful maide,°
Mary I mene, doghter to Seint Anne,
Bifore whos child aungeles singe Osanne,°
If I be giltlees of this felonie,
My socour be, for elles° I shal die!”

Have ye nat seyn som time a pale face,
Among a prees,° of him that hath be lad°
Toward his deeth, wheras him gat° no grace,
And swich a colour in his face hath had,
Men mighte knowe his face, that was bistad,°
Amonges all the faces in that route:°
So stant Custance, and loketh hir aboute.

O quenes, livinge in prosperitee,
Duchesses, and ye ladies everichone,°
Haveth som routhe° on hir adversitee;
An emperoures doghter stant° allone;
She hath no wight to whom to make hir mone.°
O Blood royal, that stondest in this drede,
Fer° ben thy freendes at thy grete nede!

This Alla king hath swich compassioun,
As gentil° herte is fulfild of pitee,
That from his yën° ran the water doun.
“Now hastily do fecche a book,”° quod he,
“And if this knight wol sweren how that she
This womman slow,° yet wole we us avise°
Whom that we wole that shal ben our justise.”°

A Briton book, writen with Evangiles,°
Was fet,° and on this book he swoor anoon
She gilty was, and in the mene whiles°
A hand him smoot° upon the nekke-boon,
That doun he fil atones° as a stoon,°
And bothe his yën broste° out of his face
In sight of every body in that place.

A vois was herd in general audience,
And seid, “Thou hast desclaundred° giltelees
The doghter of holy chirche in hie presence;°
Thus hastou doon, and yet holde I my pees.”
Of this mervaille agast° was al the prees;
As mased° folk they stoden everichone,
For drede of wreche,° save Custance allone.

Greet was the drede° and eek the repentance
Of hem that hadden wrong suspeccioun
Upon this sely° innocent Custance;
And, for this miracle, in conclusioun,
And by Custances mediacioun,
The king, and many another in that place,
Converted was, thanked be Cristes grace!

This false knight was slain for his untrouthe°
By jugement of Alla hastifly;
And yet Custance hadde of his deeth gret routhe.
And after this Jesus, of his mercy,
Made Alla wedden ful solempnely
This holy maiden, that is so bright and shene,°
And thus hath Crist ymaad° Custance a quene.

But who was woful, if I shal nat lie,
Of this wedding but Donegild, and na mo,°
The kinges moder, ful of tirannie?°
Hir thoughte° hir cursed herte brast atwo;°
She wolde° noght hir sone had do so;
Hir thoughte a despit,° that he sholde take
So strange a creature unto his make.°

Me list nat° of the chaf° nor of the stree°
Maken so long a tale, as of the corn.
What° sholde I tellen of the royaltee
At mariage, or which cours° gooth biforn,
Who bloweth in a trompe or in an horn?
The fruit° of every tale is for to seye;°
They ete, and drinke, and daunce, and singe, and pleye.

They goon to bedde, as it was skile° and right;
For, thogh that wives been ful holy thinges,
They moste take in pacience at night
Swich maner necessaries as been plesinges
To folk that han ywedded hem with ringes,
And leye a lite° hir holinesse aside
As for the time; it may no bet bitide.°

On hir he gat a knave-child° anoon,
And to a bishop and his constable eke°
He took° his wif to kepe,° whan he is goon
To Scotland-ward, his fo-men° for to seke;
Now faire Custance, that is so humble and meke,
So longe is goon° with childe, til that stille
She halt° hir chambre, abiding° Cristes wille.

The time is come, a knave-child she ber;°
Mauricius at the font-stoon° they him calle;
This constable dooth forth come a messager,°
And wroot° unto his king, that cleped° was Alle,
How that this blisful tiding° is bifalle,
And othere tidings speedful° for to seye;
He takth the lettre, and forth he gooth his weye.

This messager, to doon his avantage,°
Unto the kinges moder rideth swithe,°
And salueth° hir ful faire in his langage,
“Madame,” quod he, “ye may be glad and blithe,
And thanke God an hundred thousand sithe;°
My lady quene hath child, withouten doute,
To joye and blisse of al this regne aboute.

Lo, heer the lettres seled° of this thing,
That I mot° bere with al the haste I may;
If ye wol aught° unto your sone the king,
I am your servant, bothe night and day.”
Donegild answerde, “As now at this time, nay;
But heer al night I wol thou take thy reste,
Tomorwe wol I seye thee what me leste.”°

This messager drank sadly° ale and win,
And stolen were his lettres prively
Out of his box,° whil he sleep as a swin;°
And countrefeted° was ful subtilly
Another lettre, wroght° ful sinfully,
Unto the king direct of this matere
Fro his constable, as ye shul after here.

The lettre spak, “The queen delivered was
Of so horrible a feendly° creature,
That in the castel noon so hardy° was
That any while dorste° ther endure.
The moder was an elf,° by aventure
Ycome, by charmes or by sorcerie,
And every wight hateth hir companie.”

Wo was this king whan he this lettre had seyn,°
But to no wighte he tolde his sorwes sore,°
But of his owene honde he wroot agein,
“Welcome the sonde° of Crist for evermore
To me, that am now lerned in his lore;°
Lord, welcome be thy lust° and thy plesaunce,
My lust° I putte al in thin ordinaunce!°

Kepeth° this child, al be it foul or fair,
And eek° my wif, unto min hoomcominge;
Crist, whan him list,° may sende me an heir
More agreable than this to my likinge.”
This lettre he seleth, prively wepinge,
Which to the messager was take sone,°
And forth he gooth; ther is na more to done.

O messager, fulfild of dronkenesse,
Strong is thy breeth, thy limes faltren° ay,
And thou biwreyest° alle secreenesse.
Thy mind is lorn,° thou janglest° as a jay,
Thy face is turned in a newe array!°
Ther dronkenesse regneth° in any route,°
Ther is no conseil° hid, withouten doute.

O Donegild, I ne have noon English digne°
Unto thy malice and thy tirannie!
And therfor to the feend° I thee resigne,°
Let him enditen° of thy traitorie!
Fy, mannish, fy! O nay, by God, I lie,
Fy, feendly° spirit, for I dar wel telle,
Though thou heer walke, thy spirit is in helle!

This messager comth fro the king again,
And at the kinges modres court he lighte,°
And she was of this messager ful fain,°
And plesed him in al that ever she mighte.
He drank, and wel his girdel underpighte.°
He slepeth, and he snoreth in his gise°
Al night, unto the sonne gan arise.

Eft° were his lettres stolen everichon
And countrefeted° lettres in this wise;
“The king comandeth his constable anon,
Up° peine of hanging, and on heigh juise,°
That he ne sholde suffren in no wise
Custance inwith his regne° for t’abide°
Thre dayes and a quarter of a tide;°

But in the same ship as he hir fond,
Hir and hir yonge sone, and al hir gere,
He sholde putte, and croude° hir fro the lond,
And charge° hir that she never eft° come there.”
O my Custance, wel may thy goost° have fere°
And sleping in thy dreem been in penance,
When Donegild caste° al this ordinance!°

This messager on morwe, whan he wook,
Unto the castel halt° the nexte wey,
And to the constable he the lettre took;
And whan that he this pitous lettre sey,°
Ful ofte he seide “Allas!” and “Weilawey!”
“Lord Crist,” quod he, “how may this world endure?
So ful of sinne is many a creature!

O mighty God, if that it be thy wille,
Sith° thou art rightful juge, how may it be
That thou wolt suffren° innocents to spille,
And wikked folk regne in prosperitee?
O Good Custance, allas! so wo is me
That I mot° be thy tormentour, or deie
On shames deeth; ther is noon other weye!”

Wepen bothe yonge and olde in al that place,
Whan that the king this cursed lettre sente,
And Custance, with a deedly pale face,
The ferthe day toward hir ship she wente.
But natheles she taketh in good entente°
The wille of Crist, and, kneling on the stronde,°
She seide, “Lord! ay welcom be thy sonde!°

He that me kepte° fro the false blame
Whil I was on the londe amonges yow,
He can me kepe from harme and eek fro shame
In salte see, althogh I se nat how.
As strong as ever he was, he is yet now.
In him triste° I, and in his moder dere,
That is to me my seil° and eek my stere.”°

Hir litel child lay weping in hir arm,
And kneling, pitously to him she seide,
“Pees, litel sone, I wol do thee non harm.”
With that hir kerchef of hir heed she breide,°
And over his litel yën she it leide;
And in hir arm she lulleth it ful faste,°
And into heven hir yën up she caste.

“Moder,” quod she, “and maide bright, Marie,
Sooth is that thurgh wommannes eggement°
Mankind was lorn° and damned ay to die,
For which thy child was on a crois yrent;°
Thy blisful yën sawe al his torment;
Than is ther no comparisoun bitwene
Thy wo and any wo man may sustene.°

“Thou sawe thy child yslain° bifor thin yën,
And yet now liveth my litel child, parfay!°
Now, lady bright, to whom all woful cryën,
Thou glorie of wommanhede, thou faire may,°
Thou haven° of refut,° brighte sterre° of day,
Rewe° on my child, that of thy gentillesse
Rewest on every rewful° in distresse!

“O litel child, allas! what is thy gilt,
That never wroughtest sinne as yet, pardee
Why wil thin harde fader han thee spilt?°
O mercy, dere constable!” quod she;
“As lat my litel child dwelle heer with thee;
And if thou darst° not saven him, for blame,°
So kis him ones in his fadres name!”

Therwith she loketh bakward to the londe,
And seide, “Farwel, housbond routhelees!”°
And up she rist,° and walketh doun the stronde°
Toward the ship; hir folweth al the prees,°
And ever she preyeth hir child to holde his pees;
And taketh hir leve, and with an holy entente
She blesseth hir; and into ship she wente.

Vitailled° was the ship, it is no drede,
Habundantly for hir, ful longe space,
And other necessaries that sholde nede
She hadde ynogh, heried° be Goddes grace!
For wind and weder° almighty God purchace,°
And bringe hir hoom! I can no bettre seye;
But in the see she driveth forth° hir weye.

Alla the king comth hoom, sone after this,
Unto his castel of the which I tolde,
And axeth° wher his wif and his child is.
The constable gan aboute his herte colde,°
And pleinly al the maner he him tolde
As ye han herd, I can telle it no bettre,
And sheweth the king his seel° and eek his lettre,

And seide, “Lord, as ye comaunded me
Up° peine of deeth, so have I doon, certein.”
This messager tormented° was til he
Moste biknowe° and tellen, plat° and plein,
Fro night to night, in what place he had lein.°
And thus, by wit and subtil enqueringe,°
Ymagined was° by whom this harm gan springe.

The hand was knowe that the lettre wroot,°
And al the venim of this cursed dede,
But in what wise, certeinly I noot.°
Th’effect is this, that Alla, out of drede,°
His moder slow,° that men may pleinly rede,
For that she traitour was to hir ligeaunce.°
Thus endeth olde Donegild with meschaunce.°

The sorwe° that this Alla, night and day,
Maketh for his wif and for his child also,
Ther is no tonge that it telle may.
But now wol I unto Custance go,
That fleteth° in the see, in peine and wo,
Five yeer and more, as liked° Cristes sonde,°
Er° that hir ship approched unto londe.

Under an hethen° castel, atte laste,
Of which the name in my text noght I finde,
Custance and eek° hir child the see upcaste.
Almighty God, that saveth al mankinde,
Have on Custance and on hir child som minde,
That fallen is in hethen hand eftsone,°
In point to spille,° as I shal telle yow sone.°

Doun from the castel comth ther many a wight°
To gauren° on this ship and on Custance.
But shortly, from the castel, on a night,
The lordes stiward°—God yeve° him meschaunce!°—
A theef,° that had reneied our creaunce,°
Com into ship allone, and seide he sholde
Hir lemman° be, wherso she wolde or nolde.°

Wo was this wrecched womman tho° bigon,°
Hir child cride, and she cride pitously;
But blisful Marie heelp° hir right anon;°
For with hir strugling wel and mightily
The theef fil over bord al sodeinly,
And in the see he dreinte° for vengeance;
And thus hath Crist unwemmed° kept Custance.

O foule lust of luxurie!° lo, thin ende!
Nat only that thou feintest° mannes minde,
But verraily thou wolt his body shende;°
Th’ende° of thy werk or of thy lustes blinde
Is compleining, how many oon may men finde
That noght for werk° somtime,° but for th’entente°
To doon this sinne, ben outher slein° or shente!°

How may this waike° womman han this strengthe
Hir to defende again this renegat?°
O Golias,° unmesurable of lengthe,
How mighte David make thee so mat,°
So yong and of armure so desolat?°
How dorste° he loke upon thy dredful° face?
Wel may men seen, it nas° but Goddes grace!

Who yaf Judith corage or hardinesse
To sleen° him, Olofernus, in his tente,
And to deliveren° out of wrecchednesse
The peple of God? I seye, for this entente,
That, right as God spirit of vigour sente
To hem, and saved hem out of meschance,°
So sente he might and vigour to Custance.

Forth goth hir ship thurghout the narwe° mouth
Of Jubaltar° and Septe,° driving ay,
Somtime West, somtime North and South,
And somtime Est, ful many a wery day,
Til Cristes moder (blessed be she ay!)
Hath shapen, thurgh hir endelees goodnesse,
To make an ende of al hir hevinesse.

Now lat us stinte° of Custance but a throwe,°
And speke we of the Romain Emperour,
That out of Surrie° hath by lettres knowe
The slaughtre of Cristen folk, and dishonour
Don to his doghter by a fals traitour,
I mene the cursed wikked Sowdanesse,°
That at the feste leet sleen° both more and lesse.

For which this Emperour hath sent anoon°
His senatour, with royal ordinance,
And othere lordes, God wot,° many oon,
On Surriens to taken heigh° vengeance.
They brennen,° sleen,° and bringe hem to meschance°
Ful many a day; but shortly, this is th’ende,
Homward to Rome they shapen hem to wende.°

This senatour repaireth° with victorie
To Rome-ward, sailing ful royally,
And met the ship driving, as seith the storie,°
In which Custance sit ful pitously.
Nothing ne knew he what she was, ne why
She was in swich array;° ne she nil seye°
Of hir estaat, althogh° she sholde deie.

He bringeth hir to Rome, and to his wif
He yaf° hir, and hir yonge sone also;
And with the senatour she ladde her lif.
Thus can our lady bringen out of wo
Woful Custance, and many another mo.°
And longe time dwelled she in that place,
In holy werkes ever, as was hir grace.

The senatoures wif hir aunte was,
But for al that she knew hir never the more;°
I wol no lenger tarien° in this cas,
But to king Alla, which I spak of yore,°
That for his wif wepeth and siketh° sore,
I wol retourne, and lete I wol Custance
Under the senatoures governance.

King Alla, which that hadde his moder slain,°
Upon a day fil in swich repentance,
That, if I shortly tellen shal and plain,
To Rome he comth, to receiven his penance;
And putte him in the Popes ordinance°
In heigh and low, and Jesu Crist bisoghte
Foryeve° his wikked werkes that he wroghte.

The fame anon thurgh Rome toun is born,°
How Alla king shal come on pilgrimage,
By herbergeours° that wenten him biforn;
For which the senatour, as was usage,
Rood him agein,° and many of his linage,
As wel to shewen his heigh magnificence
As to don any king a reverence.°

Greet chere° dooth this noble senatour
To king Alla, and he to him also;
Everich of hem doth other greet honour;
And so bifel that, in a day or two,
This senatour is to king Alla go
To feste,° and shortly, if I shal nat lie,
Custances sone wente in his companie.

Som men wolde seyn, at requeste of Custance,
This senatour hath lad this child to feste;
I may nat tellen every circumstance,
Be as be may, ther was he at the leste.°
But soth is this, that, at his modres heste,°
Biforn Alla, during the metes space,°
The child stood, loking in the kinges face.

This Alla king hath of this child greet wonder,
And to the senatour he seide anon,
“Whos is that faire child that stondeth yonder?”
“I noot,”° quod he, “by God, and by Seint John!
A moder he hath, but fader hath he non
That I of woot”°—but shortly, in a stounde,
He tolde Alla how that this child was founde.

“But God wot,”° quod this senatour also,
“So vertuous a livere in my lif,
Ne saugh I never as she, ne herde of mo
Of worldly wommen, maiden, nor of wif;
I dar wel seyn hir hadde lever° a knif
Thurghout her breste, than been a womman wikke;°
Ther is no man coude bringe hir to that prikke.”°

Now was this child as lik unto Custance
As possible is a creature to be.
This Alla hath the face in remembrance
Of dame Custance, and theron mused he
If that the childes moder° were aught° she
That was his wif, and prively he sighte,°
And spedde° him fro the table that he mighte.°

“Parfay,” thoghte he, “fantome° is in myn heed!
I oghte deme,° of skilful° jugement,
That in the salte see my wif is deed.”
And afterward he made his argument—
“What woot° I, if that Crist have hider° ysent
My wif by see, as wel as he hir sente
To my contree fro thennes° that she wente?”

And, after noon, hoom with the senatour
Goth Alla, for to seen° this wonder chaunce.
This senatour dooth Alla greet honour,
And hastifly° he sente after Custaunce.
But trusteth weel, hir liste° nat to daunce
Whan that she wiste wherefor was that sonde.°
Unnethe° upon hir feet she mighte stonde.

When Alla saugh his wif, faire he hir grette,
And weep, that it was routhe for to see.
For at the firste look he on hir sette
He knew wel verraily that it was she.
And she for sorwe as domb stant as a tree;
So was hir herte shet° in hir distresse
Whan she remembred his unkindenesse.

Twiës she swowned° in his owne sighte;
He weep, and him excuseth pitously:—
“Now God,” quod he, “and alle his halwes° brighte
So wisly° on my soule as have mercy,
That of your harm as giltelees am I
As is Maurice my sone so lik your face;
Elles the feend° me fecche out of this place!”

Long was the sobbing and the bitter peine
Er° that hir woful hertes mighte cesse;
Greet was the pitee for to here hem pleine,°
Thurgh whiche pleintes gan hir wo encresse.
I prey yow al my labour to relesse;°
I may nat telle hir wo until tomorwe,
I am so wery for to speke of sorwe.°

But finally, when that the sooth is wist°
That Alla giltelees was of hir wo,
I trowe° an hundred times been they kist,
And swich a blisse is ther bitwix° hem two
That, save the joye that lasteth evermo,
Ther is non lik, that any creature
Hath seyn or shal, whil that the world may dure.°

Tho° preide she hir housbond mekely,
In relief of hir longe pitous pine,°
That he wold preye° hir fader specially
That, of his magestee, he wolde encline
To vouchesauf som day with him to dine;
She preide him eek, he sholde by no weye
Unto hir fader no word of hir seye.°

Som men wold seyn, how that° the child Maurice
Doth° this message unto this Emperour;
But, as I gesse, Alla was nat so nice°
To him, that was of so soverein honour
As he that is of Cristen folk the flour,°
Sente° any child, but it is bet to deme°
He wente himself, and so it may wel seme.

This emperour hath graunted gentilly
To come to diner, as he him bisoghte;°
And wel rede I, he loked bisily°
Upon this child, and on his doghter thoghte.
Alla goth to his in,° and, as him oghte,°
Arrayed for this feste in every wise
As ferforth° as his conning° may suffise.

The morwe cam, and Alla gan him dresse,°
And eek his wif, this Emperour to mete;
And forth they ride in joye and in gladnesse.
And whan she saugh hir fader in the strete,
She lighte doun,° and falleth him to fete.
“Fader,” quod she, “your yonge child Custance
Is now ful clene out of your remembrance.

I am your doghter Custance,” quod she,
“That whilom° ye han sent unto Surrie.°
It am I, fader, that in the salte see
Was put allone and dampned° for to die.
Now, Gode fader, mercy I yow crie,
Send me namore unto non hethenesse,°
But thonketh my lord heer of his kindenesse.”

Who can the pitous joye tellen al
Bitwix hem° three, sin° they ben thus ymette?
But of my tale make an ende I shal;
The day goth faste, I wol no lenger lette.°
This glade folk to diner they hem sette;
In joye and blisse at mete I lete hem dwelle
A thousand fold wel more than I can telle.

This child Maurice was sithen° Emperour
Maad by the Pope, and lived Cristenly.
To Cristes chirche he dide greet honour;
But I lete al his storie passen by,
Of Custance is my tale specially.
In the olde Romain gestes° may men finde
Maurices lif; I bere it noght in minde.

This king Alla, whan he his time sey,°
With his Custance, his holy wif so swete,
To Engelond been they come the righte wey,
Wheras they live in joye and in quiete.
But litel whil it lasteth, I yow hete,°
Joye of this world, for time wol nat abide;
Fro day to night it changeth as the tide.°

Who lived ever in swich delit° o day
That him ne moeved outher conscience,
Or ire, or talent,° or som kin affray,
Envie, or pride, or passion, or offence?
I ne seye but for this ende this sentence,°
That litel whil in joye or in plesance
Lasteth the blisse of Alla with Custance.

For deeth, that taketh of heigh and low his rente,°
When passed was a yeer, even as I gesse,
Out of this world this king Alla he hente,°
For whom Custance hath ful gret hevinesse.
Now lat us prayen God his soule blesse!
And dame Custance; finally to seye,
Towards the toun of Rome gooth hir weye.

To Rome is come this holy creature,
And findeth hir frendes there hole and sounde:
Now is she scaped° al hir aventure;°
And whan that she hir fader hath yfounde,
Doun on hir kneës falleth she to grounde;
Weping for tendrenesse in herte blithe,
She herieth° God an hundred thousand sithe.°

In vertu and in holy almesdede°
They liven alle, and never asonder wende;°
Til deeth departed° hem, this lif they lede.
And fareth now weel, my tale is at an ende.
Now Jesu Crist, that of his might may sende
Joye after wo, governe us in his grace,
And kepe us alle that ben in this place! Amen.

Our Hoste upon his stirops stood anon,
And seide, “Good men, herkneth everich° on;
This was a thrifty° tale for the nones!°
Sir parish prest,” quod he, “for Goddes bones,
Tel us a tale, as was thy forward yore.°
I see wel that ye lerned° men in lore
Can° moche good, by Goddes dignitee!”
The Parson him answerd, “Benedicite!°
What eileth° the man, so sinfully to swere?”
Our Hoste answerde, “O Jankin, be ye there?
I smelle a loller° in the wind,” quod he.
“How! good men,” quod our Hoste, “herkneth me;°
Abideth, for Goddes digne° passioun,
For we shal han a predicacioun;°
This loller heer wil prechen us somwhat.”
“Nay, by my fader soul! that shal he nat,”
Seid the Squire; “heer he shal nat preche,
He shal no gospel glosen° heer ne teche.
We leve° alle in the grete God,” quod he,
“He wolde sowen som difficultee,
Or springen cokkel° in our clene corn;°
And therfor, hoste, I warne thee biforn,
My joly° body shal a tale telle,
And I shal clinken yow so mery a belle,
That I shal waken al this compaignie;
But it shal nat ben of philosophie,
Ne physlias,° ne termes queinte° of lawe;
Ther is but litel Latin in my mawe.”°
