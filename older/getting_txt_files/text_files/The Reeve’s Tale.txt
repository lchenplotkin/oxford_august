¶Whan folk had laughen at this nice cas°
Of Absolon and hende° Nicholas,
Diverse folk diversely they seide;
But, for the more part, they loughe° and pleide,
Ne at this tale I saugh no man him greve,°
But it were° only Osewold the Reve,°
Bicause he was of carpenteres craft.
A litel ire° is in his herte ylaft,°
He gan to grucche° and blamed it a lite.°

¶“So theek,”° quod he, “ful wel coude I thee quite°
With blering° of a proud milleres eye,
If that me liste° speke of ribaudie.
But ik° am old, me list not pley for age;
Gras time° is doon, my fodder° is forage,°
This white top° writeth mine olde yeres,
Min herte is also mowled° as min heres,
But if I fare as dooth an open ers;°
That ilke° fruit is ever leng° the wers,°
Til it be roten in mullok° or in stree.
We olde men, I dred, so fare we;
Til we be roten, can we nat be ripe;
We hoppen° ay, whil that the world wol pipe.
For in our wil° ther stiketh ever a nail,°
To have an hoor heed° and a grene tail,°
As hath a leek; for thogh our might° be goon,
Our wil desireth folie ever in oon.°
For whan we may nat doon, than wol we speke;
Yet in our asshen olde is fir yreke.°

¶Four gledes° han we, whiche I shal devise,
Avaunting,° lying, anger, coveitise;°
Thise foure sparkles longen° unto elde.°
Our olde lemes° mow° wel been unwelde,°
But wil° ne shal nat faillen, that is sooth.
And yet ik have alwey a coltes° tooth,
As many a yeer as it is passed henne°
Sin° that my tappe of lif bigan to renne.
For sikerly,° whan I was bore, anon
Deeth drogh° the tappe of lif and leet it gon;
And ever sith hath so the tappe yronne,°
Til that almost al empty is the tonne.°
The streem of lif now droppeth on the chimbe;°
The sely° tonge may wel ringe and chimbe°
Of wrecchednesse that passed is ful yore;°
With olde folk, save dotage,° is namore.”°

¶Whan that our host had herd this sermoning,
He gan to speke as lordly as a king;
He seide, “What amounteth al this wit?°
What shul° we speke alday of holy writ?
The devel made a reve for to preche,
And of a souter,° shipman, or a leche.°
Sey forth thy tale, and tarie nat° the time,
Lo, Depeford! and it is half-way prime.°
Lo, Grenewich, ther many a shrewe° is inne;
It were al time thy tale to biginne.”

¶“Now, sires,” quod this Osewold the Reve,
“I pray yow alle that ye nat yow greve,°
Thogh I answere and somdel sette his howve;°
For leveful° is with force force ofshowve.°
This dronke millere hath ytold us heer,
How that bigiled was a carpenteer,
Peraventure° in scorn, for I am oon.°
And, by your leve,° I shal him quite° anoon;
Right in his cherles° termes wol I speke.
I pray to God his nekke mote° breke;
He can wel in min yë° seen a stalke,°
But in his owne he can nat seen a balke.”°

¶At Trumpington, nat fer fro Cantebrigge,
Ther goth a brook and over that a brigge,°
Upon the whiche brook ther stant a melle;°
And this is verray soth° that I yow telle.
A miller was ther dwelling many a day;
As eny pecok he was proud and gay.°
Pipen° he coude and fisshe, and nettes bete,°
And turne coppes,° and wel wrastle and shete;°
And by his belt he baar a long panade,°
And of a swerd ful trenchant° was the blade.
A joly popper° baar he in his pouche;
Ther was no man for peril° dorste° him touche.
A Sheffeld thwitel° baar he in his hose;°
Round was his face, and camus° was his nose.
As piled° as an ape was his skulle.
He was a market-betere° atte fulle.°
Ther dorste° no wight° hand upon him legge,°
That he ne swoor he sholde anon abegge.°
A theef he was for sothe of corn and mele,°
And that a sly, and usaunt° for to stele.
His name was hoten° dëinous° Simkin.

¶A wif he hadde, ycomen of noble kin;
The person° of the toun hir fader was.
With hir he yaf° ful many a panne° of bras,
For that° Simkin sholde in his blood allie.°
She was yfostred° in a nonnerie;°
For Simkin wolde° no wif, as he saide,
But° she were wel ynorissed° and a maide,°
To saven his estaat of yemanrie.°
And she was proud, and pert° as is a pie.°
A ful fair sight was it upon hem two;
On halidays° biforn hir wolde he go
With his tipet° wounden about his heed,
And she cam after° in a gite° of reed;
And Simkin hadde hosen° of the same.
Ther dorste° no wight clepen° hir but “dame.”
Was noon so hardy° that wente by the weye
That with hir dorste rage° or ones pleye,°
But if° he wolde° be slain of Simkin
With panade, or with knif, or boidekin.°
For jalous folk ben perilous evermo,
Algate° they wolde hir wives wenden so.°
And eek, for she was somdel smoterlich,°
She was as digne° as water in a dich;
And ful of hoker° and of bisemare.°
Hir thoughte° that a lady sholde hir spare,°
What for° hir kinrede° and hir nortelrie°
That she had lerned in the nonnerie.

¶A doghter hadde they bitwixe° hem two
Of twenty yeer, withouten any mo,
Savinge a child that was of half-yeer age;
In cradel it lay and was a propre page.°
This wenche thikke and wel ygrowen was,
With camus nose° and yën greye as glas;
With buttoks brode and brestes rounde and hie,
But right fair° was hir heer,° I wol nat lie.
The person° of the toun, for she was feir,
In purpos was° to maken hir his heir
Bothe of his catel° and his messuage,°
And straunge° he made it of° hir mariage.
His purpos was for to bistowe hir hie°
Into som worthy blood of auncetrie;
For holy chirches good° moot° been despended
On holy chirches blood, that is descended.°
Therfore he wolde his holy blood honoure,
Though that he holy chirche shold devoure.

¶Gret soken° hath this miller, out of doute,
With whete and malt of al the land aboute;
And namely° ther was a greet collegge,
Men clep° the Soler-halle at Cantebregge,°
Ther was hir whete and eek hir malt ygrounde.
And on a day it happed, in a stounde,°
Sik lay the maunciple° on a maladie;
Men wenden° wisly° that he sholde die.
For which this miller stal° both mele and corn°
An hundred time more than biforn;
For therbiforn he stal but curteisly,
But now he was a theef outrageously,
For which the wardein° chidde° and made fare.°
But therof set the miller nat a tare;°
He craketh boost,° and swoor it was nat so.

¶Than were ther yonge povre scolers two,
That dwelten in this halle, of which I seye.°
Testif° they were, and lusty° for to pleye,
And, only for hir mirthe and reverie,°
Upon the wardein bisily° they crie,
To yeve° hem leve but a litel stounde°
To goon to mille and seen hir corn° ygrounde;
And hardily,° they dorste leie° hir nekke,
The miller shold nat stele hem half a pekke°
Of corn by sleighte,° ne by force hem reve;°
And at the laste the wardein yaf hem leve.°
John hight° that oon, and Alein hight that other;
Of oon toun were they born, that highte Strother,
Fer in the north, I can nat telle where.

¶This Alein maketh redy al his gere,°
And on an hors the sak° he caste anon.
Forth goth Alein the clerk, and also John,
With good swerd and with bokeler° by hir side.
John knew the wey, hem nedede no gide,
And at the mill the sak adoun he laith.°
Alein spak first, “Al hail, Simond, yfaith;
How fares thy faire doghter and thy wif?”

¶“Alein! welcom,” quod Simkin, “by my lif,
And John also, how now, what do ye heer?”
“Simond,” quod John, “by God, nede has na peer;°
Him boës° serve himselve that has na swain,°
Or els he is a fool, as clerkes sayn.
Our manciple, I hope° he wil be deed,°
Swa werkes° ay the wanges° in his heed.
And forthy is I come, and eek Alain,
To grinde our corn and carie it ham° again;
I pray yow spede us heithen° that° ye may.”

¶“It shal be doon,” quod Simkin, “by my fay;
What wol ye doon whil that it is in hande?”°
“By God, right by the hoper° wil I stande,”
Quod John, “and se how that the corn gas° in;
Yet saugh I never, by my fader kin,°
How that the hoper wagges til and fra.”°

¶Alein answerde, “John, and wiltow swa,°
Than wil I be binethe, by my croun,°
And se how that the mele falles doun
Into the trough; that sal° be my disport.
For John, in faith, I may been of your sort;
I is as ille a miller as ar ye.”°

¶This miller smiled of hir nicetee,°
And thoghte, “Al this nis doon but for a wile;°
They wene° that no man may hem bigile;
But, by my thrift, yet shal I blere° hir eye
For al the sleighte° in hir philosophie.
The more queinte crekes° that they make,
The more wol I stele whan I take.
In stede of flour, yet wol I yeve hem bren.°
‘The grettest clerks° been noght the wisest men,’
As whilom° to the wolf thus spak the mare;°
Of al hir° art I counte noght a tare.”°

¶Out at the dore he gooth ful prively,
Whan that he saugh his time, softely;
He loketh up and doun til he hath founde
The clerkes hors, ther as it stood ybounde
Bihind the mille, under a levesel;°
And to the hors he gooth him faire and wel;
He strepeth of° the bridel right anon.
And whan the hors was laus,° he ginneth gon°
Toward the fen,° ther °wilde mares renne,
Forth with “Wehe!,” thurgh thikke and thenne.

¶This miller gooth again, no word he seide,
But dooth his note,° and with the clerkes pleide,
Til that hir corn was faire and wel ygrounde.
And whan the mele is sakked and ybounde,
This John goth out and fint° his hors away,
And gan to crie “Harrow!” and “Weilaway!°
Our hors is lorn!° Alein, for Goddes banes,°
Step on thy feet,° com out, man, al at anes!°
Allas, our wardein has his palfrey° lorn.”
This Alein al forgat, both mele and corn,
Al was out of his minde his housbondrie.°
“What? whilk° way is he gane?”° he gan to crie.

¶The wif cam leping inward with a ren,°
She seide, “Allas! your hors goth to the fen
With wilde mares, as faste as he may go.
Unthank come° on his hand that bond him so,
And he that bettre sholde han knit the reine.”°
“Allas,” quod John, “Alein, for Cristes peine,
Lay doun thy swerd, and I wil min alswa;°
I is ful wight,° God waat,° as is a ra;°
By Goddes herte he sal° nat scape us bathe.°
Why nadstow° pit the capul° in the lathe?°
Il hail,° by God, Alein, thou is a fonne!”°

¶This sely° clerkes han ful faste yronne
Toward the fen, bothe Alein and eek John.
And whan the miller saugh that they were gon,
He half a busshel of hir flour hath take,
And bad his wif go knede it in a cake.°
He seide, “I trow° the clerkes were aferd;°
Yet can a miller make a clerkes berd°
For al his art;° now lat hem goon hir weye.
Lo wher they goon, ye, lat the children pleye;
They gete him° nat so lightly, by my croun!”

¶Thise sely clerkes rennen up and doun
With “Keep, keep, stand, stand, jossa!,° warderere!,°
Ga whistle thou, and I sal kepe him here!”
But shortly, til° that it was verray night,
They coude nat, though they dide al hir might,
Hir capul cacche, he ran alwey so faste,
Til in a dich they caughte him atte laste.
Wery and weet as beste° is in the rein,°
Comth sely John, and with him comth Alein.
“Allas,” quod John, “the day that I was born!
Now are we drive til hething and til scorn.°
Our corn is stoln, men wil us foles calle,
Bath° the wardein and our felawes alle,
And namely° the miller; weilaway!”
Thus pleineth° John as he goth by the way
Toward the mille, and Bayard in his hond.°
The miller sitting by the fir he fond,
For it was night, and forther might they noght;
But, for the love of God, they him bisoght
Of herberwe° and of ese,° as for hir peny.°

¶The miller seide again,° “If ther be eny,
Swich as it is, yet shal ye have your part.
Min hous is streit,° but ye han lerned art;°
Ye kan by argumentes make a place
A mile brood° of twenty foot of space.
Lat see now if this place may suffise,
Or make it roum with speche,° as is your gise.”°

¶“Now, Simond,” seide John, “by Seint Cutberd,°
Ay° is thou mery, and this is faire answerd.
I have herd seid, man sal° taa° of twa° thinges
Slik° as he finds, or taa° slik as he bringes.
But specially, I pray thee, hoste dere,
Get us som mete° and drinke, and make us chere,
And we wil payen trewly atte fulle.
With empty hand men may na haukes tulle;°
Lo here our silver, redy for to spende.”

¶This miller into town his doghter sende
For ale and breed, and rosted hem a goos,
And bond hir hors, it sholde nat goon loos;
And in his owne chambre hem made a bed
With shetes and with chalons° faire yspred,
Noght from° his owne bed ten foot or twelve.
His doghter hadde a bed, al by hirselve,
Right in the same chambre, by and by;°
It mighte be no bet,° and cause why,
Ther was no roumer herberwe° in the place.
They soupen° and they speke, hem to solace,°
And drinken ever strong ale atte° beste.
Aboute midnight wente they to reste.

¶Wel hath this miller vernisshed his heed;°
Ful pale he was for dronken,° and nat reed.
He yexeth,° and he speketh thurgh the nose
As he were on the quakke,° or on the pose.°
To bedde he gooth, and with him goth his wif.
As any jay° she light was and jolif,°
So was hir joly whistle° wel ywet.
The cradel at hir beddes feet is set,
To rokken, and to yeve the child to souke.°
And whan that dronken al° was in the crouke,°
To bedde went the doghter right anon;
To bedde gooth Alein and also John;
Ther nas na more, hem nedede no dwale.°
This miller hath so wisly° bibbed° ale,
That as an hors he snorteth° in his sleepe,
Ne of his tail bihinde he took no keepe.°
His wif bar him a burdon,° a ful strong,
Men mighte hir routing here° two furlong;
The wenche routeth eek° par compaignie.

¶Alein the clerk, that herd this melodie,
He poked John, and seide, “Slepestow?
Herdestow ever slik° a sang° er now?
Lo, whilk a compline° is ymel° hem alle!
A wilde fir° upon thair bodies falle!°
Wha° herkned° ever slik a ferly° thing?
Ye, they sal° have the flour° of il ending.
This lange night ther tides° me na reste;
But yet, na fors;° al sal be for the beste.
For John,” seide he, “als ever moot° I thrive,
If that I may, yon wenche wil I swive.°
Som esement° has lawe yshapen us;°
For John, ther is a law that sayes thus,
That gif° a man in a° point be ygreved,
That in another he sal be releved.
Our corn is stoln, soothly, it is na nay,
And we han had an il fit° al this day.
And sin I sal have nan amendement,°
Again° my los I wil have esement.
By Goddes saule, it sal neen° other be!”

¶This John answerde, “Alain, avise thee,°
The miller is a perilous° man,” he seide,
“And if that he out of his sleep abreide,°
He mighte doon us bathe° a vileinie.”°

¶Alein answerde, “I count him nat a flie”;
And up he rist, and by the wenche he crepte.
This wenche lay upright,° and faste slepte,
Til he so ny was, er she mighte espie,
That it had been to late for to crie,
And shortly for to sein, they were aton;°
Now pley, Alein! for I wol speke of John.

¶This John lith stille a furlong-wey° or two,
And to himself he maketh routhe° and wo:
“Allas!” quod he, “This is a wikked jape;°
Now may I sein that I is but an ape.°
Yet has my felaw somwhat for his harm;
He has the milleris doghter in his arm.
He auntred him,° and has his nedes sped,°
And I lie as a draf sak° in my bed;
And when this jape is tald another day,
I sal been halde a daf,° a cokenay!°
I wil arise, and auntre it,° by my faith!
‘Unhardy is unsely,’° thus men saith.”
And up he roos and softely he wente
Unto the cradle and in his hand it hente,°
And baar it softe unto his beddes feet.

¶Sone after this the wif hir routing leet,°
And gan awake, and wente hir out to pisse,
And cam again, and gan hir cradel misse,
And groped heer and ther, but she fond noon.
“Allas!” quod she, “I hadde almost misgoon;
I hadde almost gon to the clerkes bed.
By, benedicite! thanne hadde I foule ysped”:°
And forth she gooth til she the cradel fond.
She gropeth alwey forther with hir hond,
And fond the bed, and thoghte noght but good,°
Bicause that the cradel by it stood,
And niste° wher she was, for it was derk;
But faire and wel she creep in to the clerk,
And lith° ful stille, and wolde han caught a sleep.
Withinne a whil this John the clerk up leep,°
And on this gode wif he leith on sore.°
So mirie a fit° ne hadde she nat ful yore;°
He priketh harde and depe as he were mad.
This joly lif han thise two clerkes lad°
Til that the thridde cok bigan to singe.

¶Alein wex wery° in the daweninge,°
For he had swonken° al the longe night;
And seide, “Far wel, Malin, swete wight!°
The day is come, I may no lenger bide;°
But evermo, wher so I go or ride,
I is thin awen clerk, swa have I sel!”°
“Now dere lemman,”° quod she, “go, far wel!
But er thou go, o thing I wol thee telle,
Whan that thou wendest° homward by the melle,°
Right at the entree of the dore bihinde,
Thou shalt a cake° of half a busshel finde
That was ymaked of thin owne mele,°
Which that I heelp my fader for to stele.
And, goode lemman, God thee save and kepe!”°
And with that word almost she gan to wepe.

¶Alein uprist, and thoughte, “Er that it dawe,°
I wol go crepen in by my felawe”;
And fond the cradel with his hand anon,
“By God,” thoghte he, “al wrang° I have misgon;
Min heed is toty° of my swink° tonight,
That maketh me that I go nat aright.
I woot wel by the cradel, I have misgo,°
Heer lith° the millere and his wif also.”
And forth he goth, a twenty devel way,°
Unto the bed theras the miller lay.
He wende° have cropen° by his felaw John;
And by the millere in he creep anon,°
And caughte him by the nekke, and softe he spak:
He seid, “Thou, John, thou swinesheed,° awak!
For Cristes saule,° and heer a noble game.
For by that lord that called is Seint Jame,
As I have thries,° in this shorte night,
Swived° the millers doghter bolt upright,°
Whil thow hast as a coward been agast.”°

¶“Ye, false harlot,”° quod the millere, “hast?
A! false traitour! false clerk!” quod he,
“Thou shalt be deed, by Goddes dignitee!
Who dorste° be so bold to disparage°
My doghter, that is come of swich linage?”
And by the throte-bolle° he caughte Alain.
And he hente° him despitously° again,°
And on the nose he smoot him with his fest.°
Doun ran the blody streem upon his brest;
And in the floor, with nose and mouth tobroke,
They walwe° as doon two pigges in a poke.°
And up they goon, and doun again anon,
Til that the miller sporned at° a stoon,
And doun he fil bakward upon his wif,
That wiste° nothing of this nice strif;°
For she was falle aslepe a lite wight°
With John the clerk, that waked hadde al night.
And with the fal, out of hir sleep she breide°—
“Help, holy crois of Bromeholm,” she seide,
In manus tuas!° Lord, to thee I calle!
Awak, Simond! the feend° is on us falle,
Min herte is broken, help, I nam° but deed;
Ther lith oon° on my wombe° and on min heed;
Help, Simkin, for the false clerkes fighte.”

¶This John sterte up° as faste as ever he mighte,
And graspeth by the walles to and fro,
To finde a staf; and she sterte up also,
And knew the estres° bet° than did this John,
And by the wal a staf she fond, anon,°
And saugh a litel shimering of a light,
For at an hole in shoon the moone bright;
And by that light she saugh hem bothe two,
But sikerly° she niste° who was who,
But as she saugh a whit° thing in hir eye.
And whan she gan this white thing espie,
She wend° the clerk had wered a volupeer.°
And with the staf she drough° ay neer and neer,
And wende han hit° this Alein atte fulle,°
And smoot the millere on the piled° skulle,
That doun he gooth and cried, “Harrow!° I die!”

¶Thise clerkes bete° him weel and lete him lie;
And greithen hem,° and tooke hir hors anon,
And eek hir mele, and on hir wey they gon.
And at the mille yet they tooke hir cake
Of half a busshel flour, ful wel ybake.°

¶Thus is the proude miller wel ybete,
And hath ylost the grinding of the whete,
And payed for the soper everideel°
Of Alein and of John, that bette° him weel.
His wif is swived,° and his doghter als;
Lo, swich it is a miller to be fals!
And therfor this proverbe is seid ful sooth,
“Him thar nat wene wel that evil dooth;°
A gilour° shal himself bigiled be.”
And God, that sitteth heighe in magestee,
Save al this compaignie grete and smale!
Thus have I quit° the Miller in my tale.
