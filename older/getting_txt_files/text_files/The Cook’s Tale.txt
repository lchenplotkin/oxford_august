¶The Cook of London, whil the Reve spak,
For joye, him thoughte, he clawed° him on the bak,
“Ha! ha!” quod he, “For Cristes passioun,
This millere hadde a sharp conclusioun°
Upon his argument of° herbergage!°
Wel seide Salomon in his langage,
‘Ne bring nat every man into thin hous’;
For herberwing by nighte is perilous.
Wel oghte a man avised for to be°
Whom that he broghte into his privetee.°
I pray to God, so yeve° me sorwe and care,
If ever, sith° I highte° Hogge of Ware,
Herde I a miller bettre yset° awerk.
He hadde a jape of malice° in the derk.
But God forbede° that we stinten° here;
And therfore, if ye vouchesauf° to here
A tale of me, that am a povre man,
I wol yow telle as wel as ever I can
A litel jape° that fil° in our citee.”

¶Our Host answerde, and seide, “I graunte it thee;
Now telle on, Roger, look that it be good;
For many a pastee° hastow laten blood,°
And many a Jakke of Dovere° hastow sold
That hath been twyes hoot and twyes cold.
Of many a pilgrim hastow Cristes curs,
For° of thy persly° yet they fare the wors,
That they han eten with thy stubbel-goos;°
For in thy shoppe is many a flye loos.
Now telle on, gentil Roger, by thy name.
But yet I pray thee, be nat wrooth° for game,
A man may sey ful sooth° in game and pley.”

¶“Thou seist ful sooth,” quod Roger, “by my fey,°
But ‘sooth pley, quaad pley,’° as the Fleming seith;
And therfor, Herry Bailly, by thy feith,
Be thou nat wrooth, er we departen heer,
Though that my tale be of an hostileer.
But nathelees I wol nat telle it yit,
But er we parte, ywis, thou shalt be quit.”°
And therwithal he lough° and made chere,
And seide his tale, as ye shul after here.

A prentis° whilom° dwelled in our citee,
And of a craft° of vitaillers° was he;
Gaillard° he was as goldfinch in the shawe,°
Broun as a berie,° a propre° short felawe,°
With lokkes blake, ykembd ful fetisly.°
Dauncen he coud so wel and jolily,
That he was cleped° Perkin Revelour.°
He was as ful of love and paramour°
As is the hive ful of hony swete;
Wel was the wenche with him mighte mete.
At every bridale wolde he singe and hoppe,°
He loved bet° the tavern than the shoppe.
For whan ther any riding° was in Chepe,°
Out of the shoppe thider wolde he lepe.
Til that he hadde al the sighte yseyn,
And daunced wel, he wold nat come agein.
And gadered him a meinee° of his sort
To hoppe and singe, and maken swich disport.°
And ther they setten steven for to mete°
To pleyen at the dis° in swich a° strete.
For in the toune nas ther no prentis,
That fairer° coude caste a paire of dis
Than Perkin coude, and therto he was free°
Of his dispense,° in place of privetee.°
That fond his maister wel in his chaffare;°
For often time he fond his box° ful bare.
For sikerly a prentis revelour,
That haunteth° dis, riot,° or paramour,
His maister shal it in his shoppe abie,°
Al have° he no part of the minstralcie;
For thefte and riot, they ben convertible,°
Al conne° he pleye on giterne or ribible.°
Revel and trouthe,° as in a low degree,°
They been ful wrothe° al day, as men may see.

¶This joly prentis with his maister bood,°
Til he were ny° out of his prentishood,°
Al were° he snibbed° bothe erly and late,
And somtime lad with revel to Newgate;
But atte laste his maister him bithoghte,
Upon a day, whan he his papir° soghte,
Of a proverb that seith this same word,
“Wel bet° is roten appul out of hord°
Than that it rotie° al the remenaunt.”
So fareth it by a riotous servaunt;
It is ful lasse harm to lete him pace,°
Than he shende° al the servants in the place.
Therfore his maister yaf him acquitance,°
And bad him go with sorwe and with meschance;°
And thus this joly prentis hadde his leve.°
Now lat him riote al the night or leve.°
And for ther is no theef withoute a louke,°
That helpeth him to wasten and to souke°
Of that he bribe° can or borwe° may,
Anon he sente his bed and his array°
Unto a compeer° of his owne sort,
That loved dis and revel and disport,
And hadde a wif that heeld° for contenance°
A shoppe, and swived° for hir sustenance.°
