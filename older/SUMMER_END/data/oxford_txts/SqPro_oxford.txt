¶“Squier, com neer, if it your wille be,
And sey somwhat of° love; for, certes, ye
Connen theron° as muche as any man.”

¶“Nay, sir,” quod he, “but I wol seye as I can
With hertly° wil; for I wol nat rebelle
Again° your lust;° a tale wol I telle.
Have me° excused if I speke amis,
My wil is good; and lo, my tale is this.”
